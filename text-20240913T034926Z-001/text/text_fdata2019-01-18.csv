what explains these gains a caribbean economic miracle the world has overlooked not exactly real growth in jamaica has averaged less than 1 percent the past four years and it s expected to come in at 1 7 percent for 2018 the bull market is partly a matter of math it doesn t take much investment to make a tiny market boom and the total value of the 37 stocks in the main jamaica index is less than 11 billion smaller than the valuation of chipotle mexican grill inc but it s also a story about kingston s nascent attempts to reinvent itself as a financial hub even as it works to reduce the heavy debt load that brought the country to the brink of crisis a decade ago clearly capital goes where it s comfortable says paul simpson a 36 year old banker and investor in kingston to see capital coming here means people must be comfortable
the european central bank and the bank of japan will hold their first policy meetings of 2019 next week as concerns mount about a global downturn gdp figures out of china could underscore the worsening outlook while flash pmis out of the eurozone will also be watched for the latest glimpse on the growth picture jobs numbers will be in focus too as australia and the uk publish monthly labour market stats one event that isn t expected to attract much attention though is the world economic forum on january 22 25 key central bank figures will be staying away from the annual pilgrimage to davos meaning there s unlikely to be anything market moving coming out of this year s forum china s economy likely decelerated further in q4 investors will be on alert on monday when china will release its estimates for economic growth for the fourth quarter of 2018 china s gdp is forecast to have expanded by 6 4 year on year between october december if confirmed that would make it the weakest growth since 2009 at the height of the financial crisis along with the gdp report data on fixed asset investment industrial output and retail sales for december will be released too lower than expected figures could send markets into a tailspin however any fallout would probably be limited given the series of stimulus measures announced recently by chinese authorities the australian dollar is likely to bear the brunt of any data miss among the major currencies as the aussie is often considered a liquid proxy for the chinese yuan the aussie would be at risk of falling back below the 0 71 level versus the us dollar if there is a sharp sell off however the australian currency could seek some support from domestic jobs data due on thursday the australian economy is expected to have added a 16 5k jobs in december lower than the previous month but still a solid figure kiwi rebound could be at risk from new zealand cpi data the new zealand dollar s ascent to 4 week highs this week didn t prove sustainable as shaky risk appetite pulled the currency lower the kiwi could face further challenges next week if quarterly inflation numbers disappoint the annual rate of the consumer price index cpi due on wednesday is expected to have eased from 1 9 to 1 8 in the fourth quarter while this would still be within the reserve bank of new zealand s 1 3 target band a move south of the 2 central rate could worry policymakers and push up the odds that the next move in rates would be down boj to hold steady could cut inflation forecasts the bank of japan will conclude its two day monetary policy meeting on wednesday and is widely anticipated to keep its stimulus program unchanged however there is speculation the bank will once again be forced to revise down its inflation forecasts as the 2 price goal remains elusive the slowdown in global growth and more recently the slump in oil prices will likely drive inflation lower in the coming months even as the boj expresses unease about the possible side effects from a prolonged period of ultra loose monetary policy december trade figures will also be released on wednesday along with the nikkei markit flash manufacturing pmi for january a surprise miss in exports growth combined with a downbeat policy statement from the boj could pressure the yen which recently scaled multi year highs against some of its major peers such as the euro pound and aussie however if the boj strikes a cautiously optimistic tone the yen could appreciate somewhat light calendar in north america the us government shutdown which has now become the longest in history will once again be playing havoc with the economic schedule with friday s durable goods orders for december likely to be delayed but apart from the disruption to the data flow the longer the shutdown drags on the bigger the impact will be on gdp growth in the absence of any effort by the white house and the democrats to resolve their row over funding for trump s mexican border wall market angst could begin to intensify and weigh on the dollar but regardless of the shutdown the us calendar is looking bare with markets being shut on monday for martin luther king day and the only other notable releases being tuesday s existing home sales for december and thursday s flash manufacturing and services pmis given the shortage of indicators the ihs markit manufacturing pmi could draw more attention than usual especially if it points to unexpected weakness in the us economy north of the border the canadian dollar will be hoping for some positive boost from canadian data after its oil led rally came to a halt last week first up are november manufacturing sales on tuesday followed by retail sales on wednesday also for november brexit not going anywhere traders hoping to see brexit headlines subsiding in the coming days following the crucial parliamentary vote this week will be disappointed in fact brexit will probably dominate the start of the week as theresa may will on monday unveil her plan b after her withdrawal agreement was crushingly defeated in parliament in the meantime the prime minister and senior government members have been reaching out to opposition parties to reach consensus on a way forward if her proposals on monday fall short of something that stands a chance of being approved by mps the pound could gyrate again in forex markets it should be noted though that the vote on the new plan won t take place until january 29 on the data front uk jobs figures for november will be watched on tuesday the british labour market has so far withstood the cooling economy and wage growth even picked up in the three months to october reaching a more than 10 year high of 3 3 y y if the higher growth in average weekly earnings proves sustainable it could ease fears of a sharper slowdown as this would be supportive of domestic demand ecb to stick to script highlight growing risks the european central bank s policy meeting will be the focal point in europe next week as the euro area economy continues to lose momentum worrying both policymakers and investors helping the ecb with their latest assessment will be a number of important business surveys the zew economic sentiment gauge out of germany will be watched on tuesday the index is forecast to improve only marginally in january on thursday the latest ihs markit pmis for the eurozone are due the manufacturing pmi is forecast to stay unchanged in january but analysts expect the services pmi to improve slightly in january s flash reading finally on friday another german barometer the ifo business climate index will be published forecasts are for the index to decline to fresh two year lows in january if the data show another marked deterioration in eurozone business activity the ecb could signal a possible change to its forward guidance on interest rates in the coming meetings although the bank is unlikely to alter anything in its statement just yet that would put the focus on president mario draghi when he holds his post meeting press conference draghi will probably be quizzed by reporters on what the central bank intends to do if the economic backdrop in the eurozone continues to worsen any indication that the governing council discussed delaying a rate hike or even loosening policy could send the euro tumbling against the greenback another monetary policy meeting to watch will be that by the norges bank on thursday norway s central bank raised rates back in september for the first time in seven years and is projecting another increase in march however given the recent slide in oil a major export earner for norway the bank could take a more cautious approach and signal a delay the norwegian krone could resume its downtrend against the euro and the dollar if there is a shift in policy

america is the greatest superpower in world history achilles was the greatest mythical warrior in the trojan war but even he had a fatal vulnerability editor in chief gerald flurry emphasized in the january 1995 philadelphia trumpet that the achilles heel of the united states military is its dependence on information technology if an enemy of the u s could sabotage this technology it could conquer the nation one of the main ways to sabotage information systems is cyberwarfare but there are others the u s air force released an electromagnetic defense task force report on november 28 it concluded that an electromagnetic pulse generated by solar flare or a nuclear weapon could cripple communication systems that the military desperately needs such an eventuality would fulfill a major bible prophecy electromagnetic pulse radiation from solar flares sometimes affects radio communications and power line transmissions in 1859 a powerful solar storm knocked out telegraph systems all over europe and north america if a similar high energy storm occurred today it would cause widespread blackouts and long term damage to the electrical grid after nuclear weapons were developed the u s government decided to test whether a nuclear explosion could create a burst of electromagnetic radiation similar to a solar flare in 1962 the u s detonated a 1 4 megaton bomb 250 miles above the pacific ocean the high altitude explosion blew out streetlights and caused phone outages 900 miles away in hawaii the blast also damaged several american british and russian satellites the electronics of the 1960s were more resilient to electromagnetic pulses than today s smartphones computers nuclear power facilities and other technologies the high altitude detonation of a nuclear weapon over north america would theoretically incapacitate power grids for months bringing chaos to major cities the u s military is ill prepared to respond to such chaos as it is dependent upon the very advanced electronics that would be destroyed communication between military bases would be cut off many weapons systems would be rendered useless based on the totality of available data the air force report states an electromagnetic spectrum attack may be a threat to the united states democracy and the world order none goes to war in his 1995 article mr flurry described a sobering end time bible prophecy that could be fulfilled by a cyberattack or electromagnetic pulse ezekiel 7 14 says they have blown the trumpet even to make all ready but none goeth to the battle for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof this verse says the trumpet of war will be blown in the nations descended from ancient israel mainly america and britain it seems people are expecting the military to mobilize but nobody goes to battle will this occur because of computer terrorism or an electromagnetic pulse attack or a solar flare intoxicated with success americans have forgotten god and rejected his law they trust in their military to save them from calamity but bible prophecy says the military will not respond when calamity comes all it would take is a strategic cyberattack an electromagnetic detonation or high radiation solar storm to cripple america s high tech fortifications the one and only path toward true safety and security is repentance toward god to understand more about what the bible says concerning america s misplaced trust in military technology read gerald flurry s updated article america s achilles heel and germany
china appears to be constructing a vast and detailed database of stolen information on american people and companies which the chinese government could use for intellectual property theft extortion and blackmail some notable hacks from recent years include february 2015 anthem inc an american health insurance company disclosed that hackers linked to china had stolen sensitive personal data on up to 80 million individuals june 2015 the united states office of personnel management announced that 21 5 million records belonging to 4 million americans had been stolen in a major cyberattack originating in china the records included sensitive information about people who had undergone background checks in order to be considered for u s government jobs federal bureau of investigation director james comey called the attack a very big deal from a national security perspective and from a counterintelligence perspective adding that the hackers stole a treasure trove of information about everybody who has worked for tried to work for or works for the united states government fall 2015 consumer credit reporting company equifax was hacked by chinese spies the wall street journal wrote ecurity officials feared that former employees had removed thousands of pages of proprietary information before leaving and heading to jobs in china materials included code for planned new products human resources files and manuals august 2018 reuters reported that chinese spies were using fake linkedin accounts to target americans working for the u s government and high value companies chinese intelligence uses bribery or phony business propositions in its recruitment efforts reuters wrote academics and scientists for example are offered payment for scholarly or professional papers and in some cases are later asked or pressured to pass on u s government or commercial secrets november 2018 marriott announced that information from as many as 500 million customers had been stolen including passport numbers and credit card information many of the individuals whose information was stolen are affluent americans who frequently travel for business the new york times spoke to u s officials briefed on the investigation and wrote the hackers they said are suspected of working on behalf of the ministry of state security the country s communist controlled civilian spy agency december 2018 the wall street journal reported that chinese hackers had stolen highly sensitive classified information from united states navy contractors a series of incidents in the past 18 months has pointed out the service s weaknesses highlighting what some officials have described as some of the most debilitating cybercampaigns linked to beijing the report said other incidents include a 2004 hack on sandia national labs a 2006 cyberattack on the u s commerce department a 2009 infiltration of the u s military s f 35 program and the 2010 hack on google yahoo and dow chemical and the list goes on cybersecurity expert daniel miessler wrote about the trend on january 8 it seems obvious at this point that china is building a massive database of information on american individuals and companies he wrote basically they re building an organized database of stolen information that they can use to beat us economically and militarily in the long term miessler continied he idea that a highly organized and highly trained state level adversary is actively building these kinds of databases on us and using that information however they can to secure victory that s just extremely frustrating and exhilarating and surreal all at once it s asymmetric in so many ways we don t even have that much information on our own citizens but it s being gathered and organized by a hostile government to be used against us and even crazier we wouldn t be allowed to have that much data in one place if we could do it technically joshua philipp wrote about the pattern in the epoch times in 2016 after a source in china told the publication on condition of anonymity that he was involved in creating the database an insider in china has revealed to the epoch times that he helped build a database that is now being used to handle americans personal information stolen in cyberattacks philipp wrote the source said that to create the database the chinese government brought in a small group of independent software developers from the united states he said that these americans worked alongside chinese security branches to implement the system even the fact that these americans agreed to help china could have been the result of blackmail or bribery in either case the report is chilling with a database like this philipp wrote the chinese regime can have a systematic roadmap of americans and their connections and information it can use to blackmail government employees recruit insiders as spies and monitor people who speak out against its policies america s achilles heel trumpet editor in chief gerald flurry has sounded the alarm for more than two decades about the dangers of the u s s reliance on computer systems that are vulnerable to sabotage in a january 1995 trumpet article mr flurry quoted analyst joseph de courcy who labeled this cyberdependence the western world s achilles heel a reference to the mythological greek demigod who was susceptible to injury only on his heel america is the greatest superpower this world has ever known mr flurry wrote but we have a very vulnerable point in our military our own achilles heel this vulnerability is so dangerous that i am amazed it hasn t received more publicity ibid mr flurry said de courcy s warning about america s cybervulnerability brought to mind a bible prophecy recorded in ezekiel 7 the prophecy is issued to the land of israel in the time of the end verses 1 3 which refers mainly to modern day united states and britain you can prove this with a study of our free book the united states and britain in prophecy by herbert w armstrong ezekiel 7 describes specific punishments god would send upon these nations due to their abominations verse 8 they have blown the trumpet even to make all ready but none goeth to the battle for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof verse 14 mr flurry continued it seems everybody is expecting our people to go into battle but the greatest tragedy imaginable occurs nobody goes to battle even though the trumpet is blown will it be because of a computer terrorist in the june 1999 issue of the trumpet mr flurry again discussed the u s military s dangerous vulnerability to cyberattacks writing we could lose the next war before we even begin the prospect of the mighty united states being hacked and losing the next war before it begins is bleak beyond words but the ongoing attacks on the u s by chinese hackers and the likelihood that beijing is storing data that could give them untold leverage over affluent americans both in the military and in key civilian sectors highlight how vulnerable this achilles heel may be yet there is reason for hope the same bible that accurately foretells the troubles now intensifying around the world also says the conflicts will all soon come to an abrupt end with the return of jesus christ to understand what the bible says about the dangers ahead and the astounding hope that is tied to developments now underway around the world order your free copy of russia and china in prophecy
kpmg managing partner reyaz mihular ips executive director dr dushni weerakoon ccc chief economist shiran fernando central bank governor dr indrajit coomraswamy and hayleys strategic development head manohari abeysekera at the panel discussion pic by sameera wijesinghe ceylon chamber of commerce says scope for moderate growth in its 2019 outlook says global challenges and elections balanced by good weather possible uptick in consumption experts concerned over rupee depreciation and debt warn recent political instability could linger in investor minds governor says structural changes need to continue to improve growth the economic intelligence unit of the ceylon chamber of commerce ccc expects sri lanka to grow by about 3 5 in 2019 buoyed by increased rainfall and stronger consumption but was cautious of political uncertainty ahead of elections and external challenges presenting the key findings of the outlook 2019 report compiled by the eiu ccc chief economist shiran fernando noted that sri lanka is likely to see 3 5 4 growth this year economic expansion is likely to come from personal services activities wholesale and retail trade as well as an increase in household consumption from populist policies usually implemented during an election year however fernando expressed concerns over currency depreciation and called for structural reforms to continue to put sri lanka on a sustainable growth trajectory he also noted that sri lanka s foreign direct investment while increasing was limited to big ticket items such as the hambantota port and port city that depends on bilateral relations and less on non state linked foreign investors global growth is on a downward trend and normalising interest rates could pose difficulties for sri lanka sri lanka is also facing high debt repayments and elections so this outlook is focused on shifting gears from stability to resilience we expect growth to be moderate and for the rupee to remain under some pressure though possibly not as much as what was seen this year fernando said looking at sri lanka s top exports fernando opined apparel would depend largely on the rupee outlook while both rubber and tea are facing supply side constraints tourism needs to recover from political instability but is expected to continue its growth path central bank governor dr indrajit coomaraswamy delivering the keynote address at the event outlined plans to raise the bulk of the 5 9 billion needed to repay sri lanka s debt and said the recent government delegation to visit washington for talks with the international monetary fund imf focused on creating fiscal space for the gamperaliya and samurdhi programs the governor said efforts were already underway to raise funds from india china and through an international sovereign bond the central bank aims to raise about 5 billion in the first quarter of 2019 to offset any political uncertainty that may pop up later in the year the central bank is likely to announce its growth projections for 2019 next month there are two significant headwinds in 2019 one is our reservoirs are full which means that we can have good harvests and use hydro power the second is low oil prices if you take those two factors together output can improve depreciation can give a boost to growth in the short term but a lot of other things need to come together as well but you can t keep depreciating the currency so we have to get away from that and hopefully remedial action has been taken the exogenous factors of oil prices normalisation of interest rates and dollar appreciation we cannot do much about but domestically the trade balance has been reduced by curtailing gold and vehicle imports he said the governor cautioned against using monetary policy to spur growth and called for structural reforms including fiscal consolidation reform of state owned enterprises legal and regulatory reforms to attract investment and measures to boost exports to continue my fear is that most of the attention in 2019 will be on politics noted institute of policy studies ips executive director dr dushni weerakoon speaking during the panel discussion after the release of the report risks are about the currency and i take the point that a near 20 depreciation is not such a bad thing in terms of providing some kind of a boost to export competitiveness but that will be short lived it is not long term to me the main issue is that we are in a low growth environment and a 20 depreciation today means that risks are not in terms of inflation i see the problem in terms of debt sri lanka is carrying foreign currency denominated debt of 60 of gdp with 36 of that debt held by the central government 3 by the central bank and another 20 by the state owned enterprises so a sudden sharp depreciation means our debt numbers and outlook changes overnight and when you factor in the low growth momentum those numbers start to look more alarming so in that context sri lanka moving into a critical debt repayment period till about 2021 does not provide a very positive outlook she added kpmg managing partner reyaz mihular noted recent political instability would take time to dissipate and called for pragmatic policy making that would stabilise the economy and focus on long term growth what happened in the last quarter created doubt in the minds of investors about the political stability in this country i talk to a lot of investors and when they look at a country like sri lanka they take what we do for the most part as par for the course but what happened is something that completely disturbed them because they suddenly realized the entire thing can get topsy turvy and that can create a lot of uncertainty about their future plans especially for long term investors and i think that will hang over us for some time mihular said we need to get realistic about our satiation we are eternally optimistic we think no matter what happens life will go on but it doesn t work like that everything we do there is a cost to pay for it there is nothing called a free lunch there is a need to explain in simple terms to the public the real situation of the country mihular commended selective government policies such as the effort to establish a single window for exports and a land bank but insisted the reforms needed to continue for them to have stronger impact hayleys strategic development head manohari abeysekera was upbeat about sri lanka s economic prospects in 2019 pointing out that as the central bank had clear plans on debt repayment it was less of a concern to the private sector we are quite optimistic of 2019 the agriculture sector has improved which is a big positive for us hayleys is in agriculture industries and services so it can be taken as a barometer for sri lanka s economy the central bank has its plans to raise funds to repay debt and sri lanka has never defaulted on a payment so i don t think it s all doom and gloom although we could have some political instability i am optimistic that 2019 would be a better year for the country even the political instability that happened in october and november gave a message to the politicians that they need to listen to the public she said abeysekera noted that when hayleys acquired singer sri lanka which is the largest retailer in the country with 450 consumer retail shops countrywide they found as much as 30 of the retail output comes from the farming community when we bought singer we thought demand would be from the western province and the middle class but when we drill down we realised the knock on effect of agriculture even though agriculture has limited gdp contribution 30 of sri lanka s population relies on agriculture the government should encourage exports as that would be beneficial and even with debt sri lanka still has potential to benefit from its geographical location and other attributes
beirut reuters this jan 17 story changes net foreign assets to foreign assets in 14th paragraph financial strains in lebanon have been brought into focus by turbulence on markets where its dollar denominated sovereign bonds suffered a heavy sell off last week following comments by the finance minister about the public debt the bonds recovered this week on assurances the government is absolutely not planning to restructure the debt and is committed to paying its maturing debt and interest payments at predetermined dates but the episode has added to debate about lebanon s debt sustainability after warnings from politicians the imf and world bank over economic and financial conditions in a country that has suffered years of low economic growth lebanon s factional politics has led to years of policy paralysis and obstructed reforms needed to boost investor confidence more than eight months after an election politicians have been unable to agree a new government what are the problems lebanon has one of the world s biggest public debts compared to the size of its economy largely generated through servicing existing debt and high state spending it amounts to roughly 150 percent of gdp the world bank has estimated that financial transfers to the state owned power producer alone averaged 3 8 percent of gdp from 2008 to 2017 a public sector wage increase in 2017 and higher interest rates have added to pressures on the budget deficit lebanon also has a current account deficit because it imports far more than it exports financing these two deficits has depended on critical financial transfers from its diaspora but questions over this model have grown at the heart of concerns is the recent slowdown in remittance deposit inflows which have traditionally funded a large part if not all of lebanon s financing requirement goldman sachs said in a dec 3 analysis the world bank in an october report said lebanon was exposed to significant refinancing risks attracting sufficient capital and in particular deposits to finance significantly larger budgetary and current account deficits is proving challenging in light of slower deposit growth lower oil prices have been seen by economists as a major cause of the slowdown with many lebanese working in oil producing gulf arab states political instability and lower growth in lebanon have also been cited as factors economic growth rates have fallen to between 1 and 2 percent from between 8 and 10 percent in the four years before syria s civil war began in 2011 how urgent is the situation central bank governor riad salameh said last month the banking sector was capable of financing the state s foreign and domestic debt in 2019 the central bank s foreign assets stand at around 40 billion the financial system has proven resilient through political crises assassinations and war the lebanese pound peg against the u s dollar has been stable for over two decades often in the absence of effective government the central bank has maintained stability using stimulus packages and unorthodox financial operations made possible by large diaspora deposits into the banks but since 2016 the slowdown in non resident inflows prompted the central bank to embark on financial engineering to draw more dollars to its reserves the world bank and imf have praised the central bank for a critical role but the world bank s october report noted some central bank tools were becoming less effective and that lebanon s risk profile was rising sharply confidence is critical to encouraging the inflows upon which the system rests this would be boosted if a new government was agreed and moved quickly towards making reforms of the power sector this could unlock some 11 billion in funding pledged by foreign states and institutions last year for a capital investment programme where does hezbollah figure in this the power wielded by the iran backed lebanese shi ite group hezbollah is at the heart of tension between lebanon and gulf states such as saudi arabia that once supported beirut but have turned their attention elsewhere in recent years goldman sachs noted that one cause of the slowdown in remittance and deposit growth was the perceived reduced likelihood of external support in light of heightened tensions between lebanon and the oil rich gulf countries the heavily armed group is listed as a terrorist group by the united states and fought a war with israel in 2006 we have warned for some time that if there was a fresh escalation of tensions with gulf countries or israel that could lead to another period of capital flight that puts the dollar peg under pressure jason tuvey of capital economics said the united states has tightened financial sanctions against hezbollah part of its wider effort to counter iran the lebanese banking sector has been applying these measures and anti money laundering legislation lebanon lobbied washington in 2017 to balance its tough anti hezbollah stance with the need to preserve the country s financial stability consequently sanctions were altered enough to allay fears of major economic damage the application of such measures may have weighed on some inflows to lebanon though it is difficult to know to what extent tuvey said can the next government fix the problem once prime minister designate saad al hariri manages to form a government investors will be looking for follow through on promises of reducing the budget deficit but there are concerns that politics could get in the way of reforms once again lebanese and international stakeholders agree that the budget deficit needs to narrow but a credible actionable plan for achieving this is still lacking and it remains unclear if political dynamics will allow for a concerted fiscal adjustment fitch

altered enough to allay fears of major economic damage the application of such measures may have weighed on some inflows to lebanon though it is difficult to know to what extent tuvey said can the next government fix the problem once prime minister designate saad al hariri manages to form a government investors will be looking for follow through on promises of reducing the budget deficit but there are concerns that politics could get in the way of reforms once again lebanese and international stakeholders agree that the budget deficit needs to narrow but a credible actionable plan for achieving this is still lacking and it remains unclear if political dynamics will allow for a concerted fiscal adjustment fitch ratings said writing by tom perry editing by pravin char
the euro is celebrating its 20th anniversary this month but they aren t popping corks across the continent except perhaps with the notable exception of delusional eurocrats such jean claude juncker president of the european commission who argued the euro has become a symbol of unity sovereignty and stability it has delivered prosperity and protection to our citizens some prosperity much of the continent is characterized by double digit unemployment rising inequality political strife and a virtual lost generation of youth who have never experienced anything remotely approaching a robust ebullient economy greed based integration is giving the eu a bad name the worst thing about the eurozone as a whole is the currency union itself the euro reinforces structural inequalities between member states as well as between social groups within countries it is also worth recalling that its creation was supposed to be an intermediate step toward the inevitable formation of a united states of europe of a supranational fiscal authority i e a federal union in which a central government for the whole of europe becomes responsible for the economic stabilization and income redistribution for the whole of the eu while the allocation of resources is left in the hands of the nation state governments that is clearly a long ways away given existing political tensions between the creditor nations of the germanic north and the debtor southern periphery nations to quote abraham lincoln a house divided against itself cannot stand nor can a currency union minus a real fiscal authority to go with it since the latter seems politically impossible against a backdrop of brexit yellow vest protests in france and a governing coalition in italy that openly toys with abandoning the euro a more likely outcome is the breakup of the currency union or a model of integration that isn t simultaneously an enrichment program for the investor class in an ideal world the euro s end would come via coordinated action reintroducing national currencies and immediately requiring all tax and other public contractual obligations within the nation to be denominated in that currency so as to create immediate demand for those currencies much more likely however is that the dissolution will occur via disruptive crisis that the euro has survived for 20 years is not a sign that we are moving closer to the day of an ever closer union the longstanding aspiration of the fathers of the modern day european union originally started as the six nation european coal and steel community rather it is a sign of democratic subversion a technocracy run amok that has survived by depriving elected national parliaments of control over fiscal policy taxation spending and the core economic policies of the nation state the euro has been both the method and the cause of this democratic disenfranchisement by design not by accident how you ask because by substituting national currencies with a supranational currency the euro s creation severed the link between state and money and with it the flexibility to confront economic crises of the magnitude that have been experienced throughout the euro s history especially post 2008 it has therefore become an instrument of greed as it has facilitated a massive wealth transfer toward the top tier of european society along with an evisceration of the social welfare state national parliaments remain therefore constrained because without a national currency they lack the fiscal capacity to respond and they also faced potential bankruptcy much like an american state which is a user not an issuer of the dollar mario draghi s whatever it takes speech in july 2012 alleviated the solvency problem of the national bond markets of countries in the eurozone because the european central bank is the only entity that can create the euros needed to backstop the national bonds credibly that along with some alleviation of fiscal austerity induced a modest cyclical recovery from 2015 to 2018 but the recovery such that it was has proved ephemeral the gdp growth of the european union as a whole has flamed out and is now experiencing its lowest growth in four years the trillions of euros mobilized during successive crises have largely been devoted toward covert bank bailouts and recycling money to creditors rather than assisting the vast army of unemployed greed and while each successive crisis since the euro s inception has hitherto been enough to avert the ultimate blow up of the currency union the poor economic baseline has remained constant in fact economist michael burrage recently compared the economic performance of the 12 founder eurozone members with 10 independent countries which are comparable in terms of economic structure labor institutions and productivity surprise surprise the eurozone countries rank at the bottom it is worth reiterating that this is not a european union problem but a eurozone problem because high unemployment caused by austerity policy is an enduring eurozone ez characteristic consider that countries such as norway switzerland and even the uk beset by brexit woes are outperforming the ez countries especially on the unemployment metric the underlying assumption of a common currency namely that it would lead to a convergence of the member countries production employment and trade structures has been proven false other than the currency itself the only commonality in the ez has been poor economic growth in virtually the entire region a one size fits all currency union doesn t work there is a multiplicity of challenges private debt unemployment automation education worker productivity that can only be resolved via more socially inclusive i e generous national supranational development strategies but that is within the purview of fiscal policy which in turn is constrained by the existence of each country effectively borrowing in a foreign currency which is de facto what the euro is given the institutional separation between the state and the currency itself so going back to national currencies seems a necessary first step why not simply attempt to devalue the euro for one thing relying on external boosts to growth via currency devaluation depends on the willingness of other trading partners to adopt growth strategies that will accommodate the resultant increased imports highly problematic in today s increasingly protectionist environment furthermore during previous periods of relative euro weakness the biggest beneficiary by far in the eurozone has been germany as evidenced by the fact that the country has a current account surplus now a shade under 8 percent of gdp which largely comprises the bulk of the european union s external trade surpluses with the rest of the world the rest of the bloc particularly the mediterranean members are still registering subpar growth and substantially higher levels of unemployment so in the first instance a euro devaluation helps germany not the european union as a whole furthermore the common currency means a common monetary policy which has amplified the strains of the eurozone rather than mitigating them in the period leading up to the 2008 global crisis inflation rates in the mediterranean countries were higher which meant that real interest rates were lower hence cheap credit fueled asset bubbles in countries such as greece spain and portugal which in turn provided the illusion that they were converging with the northern european economies by contrast post 2008 european central bank ecb interest rates remained too high for too long for those now debt laden periphery countries and they therefore have suffered greater fall out from the financial crisis than germany the economist servaas storm has quantified the impact during the pre crisis years 1997 2007 membership of emu was beneficial for all countries except germany and italy emu membership is estimated to have increased per capita real incomes in greece portugal and spain by 8 10 things change considerably after 2008 however being part of the eurozone has depressed the real incomes in greece by 16 in italy by 8 in portugal by 4 and in spain by 8 compared to the counterfactual in contrast most northern core economies benefited from their emu membership as their actual per capita income levels are estimated to be higher than in the counterfactual scenario without eurozone membership germany stands out in this post crisis period 2008 2014 with the average german having an actual income which is about 5 higher than the estimated non emu counterfactual the ecb s monetary policy initially fomented asset bubbles in the periphery and then exacerbated debt deflation when these bubbles burst in seeking to mitigate the southern debt deflation post 2008 however the resultant low interest rates fueled a boom in germany this largely explains why berlin s actual income is higher than the estimated counterfactual which would have occurred had germany still been using the deutschmark as the ever vigilant bundesbank likely would have raised interest rates sooner and more aggressively even with a common monetary policy had the eurozone members existed in a federal union comparable to canada or the united states policymakers could have mitigated regional divergences via fiscal transfers or equalization payments and the issue of intra regional trade imbalances would also be a non issue nobody in the u s really cares for example whether new york runs a trade deficit with texas because of the overriding existence of this federal union we call the united states of america but even though there is no common fiscal union the european monetary union custodians have nonetheless imposed a fiscal austerity straitjacket as a precondition of euro membership i e the perversely named stability and growth pact which has delivered minimal growth and lots of instability so countries that earn membership in club euro get the worst of all possible worlds minimal capacity to bolster growth via aggressive fiscal policy just fiscal austerity like joining a religion that offers hell but no heaven fiscal austerity exacerbates productivity differentials less money for investment education social welfare higher unemployment etc and locks the slow growth countries into debt trap deflation and perpetual economic stagnation see greece as exhibit a and no means of inflating away the debt domestically because there is no national printing press last but not least the champions of the monetary union notably those in berlin continue to preach the destructive myth that increased competitiveness via structural reforms which usually means the ability to fire workers more easily and cut social welfare programs will somehow enable the afflicted countries to match germany s economic dynamism however as storm points out countries can t compete if the composition of exports in each country is different germany is strong in medium and high tech manufacturing and this strength shows up in a strong export performance as well as a limited vulnerability to external shocks emphasis mine the strong export performance is in part derived from the fact that high end goods are not particularly dependent on the low labor costs to compete globally by contrast the periphery countries are generally locked into low and medium tech activities many of which compete with china and are therefore much more subject to its competitive threat italy s textile industry being a classic case in point the upshot is that what s good for germany is not so for italy or france and vice versa what is required are distinct national industrial policies aiming at accommodating and diversifying the existing trade structures of the mediterranean countries in particular sadly the eurozone makes no provision for this largely because of the eurozone s deficit phobia as i have written before there is a broader philosophic problem embodied in the pact implicit in the drive to create a stability culture is the belief that public debt is invariably an evil the consequences of which must be stopped at all costs but as events of the past decade have clearly demonstrated excessive private sector debt build up notably in asia and the united states has played a far more destabilizing role in the global economy than fiscal profligacy which undercuts one of the main rationales for retaining the stability pact in its current form if we say that the government can run budget surpluses for 15 years what we are ignoring is that this means the private sector will have to run deficits for 15 years going into debt that totals trillions of dollars in order to allow the government to retire its debt again it is hard to see why households would be better off if they owed more debt just so that the government would owe them less there are very few instances of a controlled dissolution of a currency union and a concomitant re establishment of national currencies one recent example is what occurred after the breakup of the old yugoslavian federation even though the re establishment of national currencies occurred with minimal economic disruption the dissolution did not come without cost as many of the former members of the yugoslavian federation engaged in a costly civil war shorn of tito s organizing genius longstanding suppressed resentments fostered in part by fiscal transfers from the wealthier regions to the poorer ones erupted as the federation fell apart there s no question that a coordinated dissolution among 27 different countries would be considerably more challenging consider what is happening now in the united kingdom where an ostensibly friendly divorce aka brexit has been going on two years has hitherto resolved nothing and in the end may still not occur given the restrictions the uk parliament is now placing on its negotiators it is also worth remembering that the uk does not even share a common currency as it retains the pound in the eurozone itself we would likely witness these same simmering resentments from the wealthier countries which have long criticized the mediterranean scroungers imagine what happens if the next eruption occurs in italy or france with its yellow vest protests presaging trouble there greece or cyprus are child s play by comparison in any conceivable outcome benign or otherwise there will almost certainly be widespread impositions of capital controls and bank holidays to prevent runs on deposits as well as recourse to industrial protection and government controls and supports to mitigate the resultant fall out to say nothing of endless international court challenges given the widespread holding of euros by institutions across the globe but the alternative of the status quo is increasingly untenable given the huge scale of youth unemployment rising inequality and the growing numbers disenfranchised marginalized impoverished and dispossessed by this 20 year experiment in economic sadism less greed is needed for survival if national currencies are to be re established this must come with the reclamation of a nation state more committed to genuine popular sovereignty more democratic less oligarchical control over the economy full employment and a robust network of social welfare provision we ve had far too many examples of the alternatives to contemplate over the course of european history an ever closer union is a worthy aspiration but it should not be focused on one brussels based government obsessing about fiscal austerity budget discipline and focusing its priorities on safeguarding its banks at the expense of the broader population ideally a reformed european union should find its fullest manifestations via cooperative yet independent sovereign nation states grounded in the historically generous social welfare states that characterized the continent in the aftermath of world war ii the urgency reflected in mario draghi s whatever it takes speech would have been more admirable if it had focused not on saving the euro at all costs but rather on establishing a full employment economy that benefits all european citizens not just its financiers and oligarchs there is no point in preserving a currency union if it comes at a cost of sabotaging economic growth and the broad welfare of the eu s citizens likewise the power of the nation state s fiscal policy should not be restricted but freely deployed alongside of or if necessary substituting the market to ensure that equitable prosperity is achieved for the many not the few
protests against fuel price hikes in zimbabwe have entered their third day posing a major challenge for president emmerson mnangagwa who replaced long time leader robert mugabe and promised to repair the creaking economy the crisis will not be easy to fix there is a severe shortage of dollars fuel and medicines while inflation hit 31 percent in november the highest in a decade foreign investors are by and large staying away what sparked the latest clashes everyday life has been getting harder as the price of basic goods spirals in the past two months the country has suffered acute shortages of imported goods including medicines food and fuel motorists can wait for hours to fill up at fuel stations where soldiers are often deployed to break up fights over who is next in line on saturday mnangagwa announced to reporters that the price of petrol had increased to 3 31 per litre from 1 32 from midnight but there would be no increase for foreign embassies and tourists paying in cash u s dollars it was the final straw for some zimbabweans and violent protests broke out on monday three people including a police officer died in those clashes and since then much of the country has been at a standstill as people stay at home many people blame mnangagwa for failing to fulfil his pre election promises to kick start economic growth and make a clean break with the strong arm rule of his predecessor genesis of cash shortages the country abandoned the zimbabwe dollar in 2009 after inflation reached 500 billion percent the year before in its place the government adopted the u s dollar and other currencies including sterling and the south african rand people hoped the move would spell the end of spiralling prices and rampant money printing that made much of their earnings and savings virtually worthless but over time supply of the u s and south african currencies dried up so in november 2016 authorities in harare launched a surrogate currency paper bond notes designed to ease acute hard currency shortages the notes which now have a total face value of 400 million are backed by a 500 million loan from the african export and import bank the central bank has said they are used like cash officially pegged to the dollar at a rate of 1 1 on the street 1 fetches up to 3 bond notes reflecting the ongoing shortage of u s dollars and people s desire to trade out of cheapening bond notes and into more reliable currency a dwindling supply of bond notes and coins has led to banks limiting daily withdrawals to as little as 30 in bond notes companies are struggling to pay for imports and foreign investors cannot repatriate dividends or profits zollars when the bond note was introduced dollar deposits in the electronic banking system started losing their value government borrowing via treasury bills meant authorities were creating money without the backing of sufficient currency reserves or gold it is these electronic dollars theoretically worth 10 billion and nicknamed zollars by economists that are raising fears that zimbabwe might be heading for its second financial collapse in a decade zimbabweans can do little but watch as the money in their bank accounts loses value compared with cash prompting demands from businesses and civil servants for hard currency which can be deposited and used to make payments zollars remain officially pegged at 1 1 to the u s dollar but on the black market 1 is now worth 4 zollars that has led some businesses to offer discounts on dollar payments zimbabwe s foreign reserves now provide less than two weeks cover for imports central bank data show the government has said it would only consider launching a new currency if it had at least six months of reserves but on friday the finance minister said zimbabwe planned to introduce a new currency in the next 12 months how are businesses affected companies are struggling to import raw materials and equipment forcing them to buy dollars on the black market the government on monday postponed wage negotiations with civil service unions who are planning a nationwide strike from jan 22 to press for u s dollar pay civil servants are paid in zollars like many other workers across the country only a small minority of employees working for foreign embassies charities or large international corporations are paid in u s dollars last october the central bank ordered banks to create separate u s dollar accounts for clients who are paid from overseas which analysts said was a tacit admission by authorities that the greenback was not equal to the zollar the confederation of zimbabwe industries has warned that some of its members could stop operating by the end of the month due to the dollar crunch the group said its members had a backlog of 480 million in unpaid payments to foreign suppliers cooking oil and soap maker olivine industries said on saturday it had suspended production and put workers on indefinite leave because it owed foreign suppliers 11 million zimbabwe s largest brewing company delta beverages part owned by anheuser busch inbev abi br said it had abandoned a plan to only accept hard currency payments rather than zollars for its beer and soft drinks after the government intervened what s next despite the unrest at home mnangagwa still plans a visit later this month to the world economic forum in davos switzerland where he is expected to hold meetings aimed at luring back foreign investment the former spy chief installed after mugabe s removal in a coup in november 2017 was elected in july amid hopes that he would help secure an economic turnaround for zimbabwe and has said his nation is open for business but critics say the man nicknamed the crocodile is moving too slowly on economic and political reforms including repealing mugabe era laws that restrict the media mnangagwa has also called for the lifting of u s sanctions against officials from the zanu pf ruling party top military figures and some government owned firms which were imposed during mugabe s rule for what washington called violations of human rights and democracy the imf has said it would be difficult for the fund to support the country s reform programme unless its 2 billion arrears with the world bank african development bank and european investment bank are paid harare says that should be done in the next 12 months and plans a programme allowing the imf to monitor its economic reforms although it does not entail funding from the lender analysts said the ongoing security crackdown could quell the protests for now but more clashes were expected unless mnangagwa s administration could find a solution to the cash woes

zimbabwe is again moving in the direction of a social explosion over the last few days mass protests against new austerity measures have spontaneously grown over into a general strike against the government the strike was formally announced to last for 72 hours from monday to wednesday but as we write these lines it is in effect still ongoing the economic crisis and its response by the government of forcing additional austerity measures onto the shoulders of ordinary working class people have sparked a furious response from the masses saturday s announcement by president emmerson mnangagwa that the price of fuel would increase overnight from 1 34 to 3 11 per litre seemed to be the last straw fuel prices are now among the most expensive in the world social eruption within hours of the announcement thousands of people spontaneously took the streets of the capital harare the protests then spread immediately to bulawayo and from there to all the way to the border with south africa masses of youths began to barricade roads in the harare suburbs of epworth and mabvuku then the situation developed rapidly on sunday public transport came to a standstill in harare when workers went on a wildcat strike protesters blocked highways and forced companies that had refused to shut their doors to comply with the strike the strike spread to other sectors throughout the city and then to the southern towns later in the day the zimbabwe congress of trade unions zctu announced a 72 hour general strike against the fuel hike in reality the zctu bureaucrats were lagging behind events the formal announcement when it came only recognised what was actually already happening on the ground saturday s announcement by president emmerson mnangagwa that the price of fuel would increase overnight from 1 34 to 3 11 per litre was the last straw for the masses image por on monday the strike spread throughout the country with increased militancy the state bankrupt both economically and politically is in no position to grant immediate concessions this explains the extreme brutality of the crackdown on these protests as usual riot police were sent to break up the demonstrations by force during heavy clashes the protesters succeeded in repelling the attacks by the police on more than one occasion in chitungwiza a town on the outskirts of the capital a police station was even stormed by protesters and burned down this posed a serious threat to the government the state then deployed the military on the streets immediately all internet access and telecommunications were cut across the country this blackout lasted for more than 30 hours social media platforms such as facebook twitter and whatsapp were all disabled all indications are that the crackdown during the blackout was brutal when communications were restored the zimbabwe association of doctors for human rights reported that during this period hospitals treated 172 people for serious injuries which included 68 people who have sustained gunshot wounds and more than 100 with dog bites initial reports say that between five and 10 people were killed and 600 arrested but despite this brutal response by the state it is clear that the crackdown failed to break the strike in fact it seems to have spurred it on the heavy response could explain in part why the strike is lasting past its 72 hour limit this is very dangerous for the regime if it fails to suppress the masses through brute force and the masses started to lose their fear the regime is basically living on borrowed time on wednesday soldiers continued to raid homes in harare s suburbs and townships and beat up people suspected of backing or taking part in the protests but later that day troop deployments were suddenly withdrawn in epworth and mabvuku instead army helicopters started shooting tear gas canisters into these high density townships of harare but the reason for the withdrawal doesn t seem to be tactical the main reason is the fear that the protesters could fraternise with the soldiers who are also affected by the country s currency problems in recent months the government even had big problems paying the salaries of the troops this would have the potential to split the army along class lines on thursday the entire transport system was still shut down the situation seemed to be calmer mainly because of the troop withdrawal from the townships to the city centres strike wave these events follow weeks of strikes in the public sector they comes on the back of a 40 day strike by doctors in december a strike by junior doctors resulted in 550 dismissals in response all doctors in the public sector went out on strike in solidarity this was preceded by a strike of teachers and nurses during the last two months of 2018 as a matter of fact this week s spontaneous general strike came just a week before planned strikes in the public sector in which more than 300 000 workers are expected to take part this strike therefore has the potential to develop into an all out general strike growing into next week which could have insurrectionary implications the government offered a 10 percent salary increase to public sector workers which would take effect in april 2019 but due to high inflation it was rightly rejected by the unions raymond majongwe of the progressive teachers union said we cannot see a government that is living in opulence and extravagance telling its workers to tighten their belts economic horror without end zimbabwe s economy is in dire straits inflation is on the rise there is a shortage of foreign currency and supplies of fuel while food and pharmaceuticals are drying up the country has a severe shortage of cash the zimbabwe dollar was wiped out by hyperinflation more than a decade ago the country then used a multi currency system including the us dollar and the south african rand then the introduction of so called bond notes in 2016 which were supposed to be equivalent to the dollar only made matters worse people saw this as an attempt to bring back the zimbabwe dollar they still remember the nightmare of hyperinflation these bond notes have now lost their value as people started to hoard us dollars which mainly became available on the black market these notes are not backed by any economic asset and are hardly worth the paper they are printed on this strike has the potential to develop into an all out general strike growing into next week which could have insurrectionary implications image simangele legodi the government tried to get out of the crisis by cutting down on imports which are far greater than zimbabwe s exports thus draining the country of foreign currency reserves but this is only exacerbating the crisis the country has a severe balance of payment crisis 2014 exports were worth 2 5 billion while imports were 6 25 billion a negative balance of 3 4 billion additionally the government was still paying the external debt which meant a constant depletion of foreign currency reserves now the prices of basic goods have more than tripled under the new administration of mnangagwa with a shortage of foreign currency leading to scarcities of everything from fuel to food mnangagwa is continuing with the same capitalist policies that have devastated the economy he made his programme clear in an article in the financial times last november the national budget must be balanced and spending reined in a large and inefficient public sector cannot be allowed to hold back private enterprise privatisation and reform of state owned enterprises are also key components of this strategy this was a declaration of war against public sector workers the result of this policy can now be seen in the state of the economy and the clashes in the streets the disastrous consequences of the imperialist policies the imf s structural adjustment programmes of the 1980s and 1990s were faithfully implemented by robert mugabe and his right hand man emmerson mnangagwa for the first two decades of their rule here are to be found the real roots of the current crisis not in the land expropriation of white farmers which followed later these measures devastated the country it was only when there was a revolt from below that mugabe for fear of losing power started attacking the imf and demagogically putting himself at the head of the land expropriation process in turn the economic and political zig zags of the mugabe regime exacerbated the crisis the crippling sanctions imposed by the west allegedly against human rights abuses by the regime only exacerbated the suffering of the masses in august 2018 us president donald trump signed the zimbabwe democracy and economic recovery amendment act zidera which extended these sanctions the european union and the us imposed sanctions against zimbabwe in 2000 after they accused ex president robert mugabe of trampling on human rights rigging elections and repressing press freedom the sanctions further devastated the economy pushing unemployment to about 85 percent these same western countries mainly britain and the united states propped up the zanu pf regime for decades when it was faithfully carrying out the dictates of the imf where was the moral outrage against human rights abuses when the regime carried out the gukurahundi massacres when between 1983 and 1987 in which more than 20 000 ndebele people were killed by the army s 5th brigade led by the current president emmerson mnangagwa instead mugabe was showered with praise accolades and honorary doctorates from western universities these sanctions had nothing to do with protecting human rights or democracy they were a direct response to mugabe dropping the imf structural adjustment programmes after they devastated the country an explosive situation there are reports of divisions between mnangagwa and chiwenga if the government fails to get back control the generals could decide to dispense with civilian rule image lemonzzandfreecolt the november 2017 coup that kicked out mugabe revealed a deep split in the regime decades austerity and capitalist crisis had completely undermined the zanu pf government after the coup military officers were deployed in the government including the head of the army constantino chiwenga who led the coup against mugabe now there are reports of deep divisions between mnangagwa and chiwenga if the government fails to get back control the generals could decide to step in yet again but this time they could decide to dispense with the niceties of civilian rule and impose direct rule in the form of a bonapartist military dictatorship then again given the situation it is possible the army itself could break along class lines which would make imposing such a regime very difficult on the other hand the masses have been pushed by the intolerable situation to take their destinies into their hands and now are losing fear of state repression this could lead to an insurrectionary situation which could bring down the government the problem facing the movement is that there is no revolutionary leadership in place zanu pf and the three factions of the opposition movement for democratic change are not capable of offering a real solution to the zimbabwean masses so long as capitalism exists there is no way out for the masses what is required is a workers party with a revolutionary socialist programme based on the expropriation of the land and industry such measures would encounter the resistance by reactionary forces within the country and imperialism but would resonate in the hearts of millions of workers throughout the continent and further the spark of revolution would land on very combustible material among the south african workers and youth and throughout the continent the revolutionary force of the working class and youth of zimbabwe is showing already that they can dislocate and overthrow the regime but the vacuum of power may be filled by parts of the existing ruling class by sections of the army or of the existing opposition who have no real solution to offer even in this case any attempt to restore order and move back to capitalist austerity will meet the resistance of the revolutionary youth and working class of zimbabwe which will be forced again and again to take the initiative it is our duty to support them
performance in the u s capital markets was mixed in 2018 with the equity new issuance market showing strength through most of the year and the debt issuance markets softening 1 the initial public offering ipo market had its strongest year since 2014 though it weakened in the fourth quarter due to significant market volatility in 2019 the u s economy is forecasted to continue to grow albeit at a slower pace and most economic indicators remain sound with an unemployment rate of 3 9 percent and 312 000 jobs added in december 2018 however ongoing concerns over interest rates domestic and geopolitical events trade and the decelerated pace of global economic growth could cause further market volatility 2018 debt markets 2018 equity markets looking ahead the u s economy enters 2019 in its ninth year of expansion with stock markets on pace to eclipse the bull run of 1991 2001 as the longest in history but whether the capital markets are capable of continued strength depends on several factors economic growth the u s economy expanded at an accelerated pace in 2018 u s gross domestic product grew 3 1 percent marking the first year since 2005 that the economy expanded above 3 percent the strength was driven by increases in government spending healthy corporate profits and increases in consumer and business spending the u s dollar rose in value 4 3 percent in 2018 according to the u s dollar index demonstrating positive sentiment toward the u s economy many economists expect the pace of u s economic growth to moderate in 2019 while a reduced economic growth rate does not necessarily mean a recession is imminent it could negatively impact stock prices and corporate earnings and reduce investor confidence nevertheless many economists have indicated that a recession in 2019 is unlikely and investment banks remain generally bullish on the near term outlook for capital markets activity however the longer the government shutdown lasts the more pressure there is on some of these forecasts corporate earnings moderating earnings growth could present challenges to capital markets activity with a forecasted decline from 9 percent in 2018 to 7 8 percent in 2019 however with s p 500 multiples at five year lows arguably the market already has adjusted prices in anticipation of a slowdown stronger than anticipated earnings growth could improve investor confidence and slow recent market declines facilitating activity as issuers seek to take advantage of rising valuations on the other hand weaker than expected earnings could contribute to market volatility and dampen capital markets activity trade uncertainty the ongoing u s china trade dispute could continue to disrupt activity to date the u s and china have imposed 250 billion and 110 billion worth of tariffs respectively on the other country s products see enhanced us export controls and aggressive enforcement likely to impact china although a temporary truce was reached in december 2018 including a 90 day pause on tariff hikes until march 1 2019 an array of challenging trade issues remain unresolved until a final resolution is reached the existing tariffs and continued uncertainty over u s china trade relations may negatively impact business investment and consumer confidence moreover other trade matters such as the effects of the renegotiated north american free trade agreement and tariffs on certain imported products e g aluminum and steel could also weigh on the markets federal reserve activity the monetary policy of the federal reserve impacted the capital markets in 2018 and could continue to do so in 2019 under the new leadership of jerome powell the federal reserve increased the federal funds interest rate four times in 2018 most recently in december 2018 from 2 25 percent to 2 5 percent and continued to pursue its plan to reduce the fed s balance sheet most recently at a pace of 50 billion per month however powell more recently indicated that the federal reserve will be patient with monetary policy as it watches economic performance from a capital markets perspective higher interest rates can reduce existing bond prices and make new bond issuances more expensive for issuers in addition market volatility from federal reserve activity and policy statements may lead to tighter and more unpredictable windows of opportunity for capital raising u s and geopolitical events political uncertainty both in the u s and internationally has significantly impacted the capital markets in recent months on the domestic front according to the washington post white house tweets have moved markets by as many as 3 percentage points in a single trading session such as when faltering trade relations with china were revealed on december 5 2018 meanwhile the longest government shutdown in history effectively closed the ipo window in january 2019 additionally even when the government reopens ipo companies with a calendar year end would need to price their offerings by february 14 2019 if they want to go effective without providing 2018 audited financial statements a prolonged government shutdown could have implications for the ipo market for the full year as the sec and issuers work through the pent up backlog and could potentially have broader economic effects if it impacts business investment and consumer confidence other elements of domestic politics may also continue to disrupt markets in 2019 with a survey by a bulge bracket financial institution finding that individual investors perceive the white house to be the greatest source of market risk in 2019 political uncertainty outside the u s also may impact the markets including brexit and trade disputes in addition to changes to foreign direct investment rules across europe see foreign investment control reforms in europe and sanctions see key developments in us sanctions equity markets in 2019 __________________________ 1 sources for the data in this article are bloomberg

here s my top 10 links from around the internet at 11 40 am in association with nz mint i welcome your additions in the comments below or via email to bernard hickey interest co nz i ll pop the extras into the comment stream see all previous top 10s here apologies for the no show yesterday i caught a lurgy from the wife and kids even my good friend panadol wasn t good enough and i m still not drinking coffee which isn t helping much but i really want to win nz 20 off amanda 1 why so confident the markets rallied overnight on hopes that europe can solve its problems but look just a few millimetres below the surface of the political landscape in germany in particular and you see plenty of potholes and hurdles for any expansion of the efsf european financial stability fund and the european central bank s role chancellor angela merkel has to get approval from her parliament on thursday for an old expansion of the fund reuters reports she will struggle to get the support of her own coalition partners and will instead have to get support from the centre left opposition which will weaken her politically germany s finance minister has even outright denied that the fund will be expanded and the german constitutional court has been very vocal in its opposition why are markets so sure germany will roll over here s more from reuters a revolt by euro skeptical backbenchers hostile to further bailouts in merkel s conservatives and their liberal free democratic coalition partners may leave her without a majority in her own camp in an internal vote on tuesday 11 deputies from merkel s cdu csu group voted against the motion and two abstained coalition sources said they expected between 2 and 5 fdp lawmakers to vote against and up to 6 to abstain if more than 19 coalition lawmakers vote against or abstain merkel will be dependent on opposition votes in a political humiliation that could weaken her ability to push through future rescues 2 and here s some more cold water for the market bulls ambrose evans pritchard reports at the telegraph that the german finance minister has called the revamped efsf a stupid american idea german finance minister wolfgang schauble said it would be a folly to boost the eu s bail out machinery efsf beyond its 440bn lending limit by deploying leverage to up to 2 trillion perhaps by raising funds from the european central bank i don t understand how anyone in the european commission can have such a stupid idea the result would be to endanger the aaa sovereign debt ratings of other member states it makes no sense he said mr schauble told washington to mind its own businesss after president barack obama rebuked eu leaders for failing to recapitalise banks and allowing the debt crisis to escalate to the point where it is scaring the world it s always much easier to give advice to others than to decide for yourself i am well prepared to give advice to the us government he said 3 auckland embraces unaffordable housing leith van onselen has done us all a service at macrobusiness com au with his analysis of the auckland council s new draft plan which he describes as one of the dumber proposals he s read for some time it is hard to understand why the auckland council would even consider implementing tighter planning controls than those that exist currently auckland s existing mul has already driven urban land prices to obscene levels according to research by respected economist arthur grimes now the chairman of the reserve bank this limit has made land immediately inside the mul between eight and 13 times more expensive than land immediately outside in the process the mul has helped make auckland s housing amongst the most expensive in the english speaking world see below chart and made auckland more densely populated than vancouver melbourne portland adelaide perth or brisbane 4 britain s green belts this debate over sprawl vs intensification and how to encourage more house building is certainly a live one in britain where the government is looking to ease restrictions on building on green belts ian cowie from the telegraph writes about the inevitable fallout for property owners thousands of house prices could fall by a third or more if coalition government proposals to change planning rules in favour of developers become law knocking hundreds of thousands of pounds off some of the most desirable homes in the green belt many estate agents are reluctant to discuss this potential domestic disaster because they are linked to building and development companies who stand to gain if given a free hand to brick over the fields and meadows that make england such a green and pleasant land but david pardoe a director of chesterton humberts rural division in salisbury was among those willing to speak out he told me it is the larger and higher value country houses that will suffer the most if developers are given the go ahead to build in green belt and other protected areas as it could jeopardize three of the factors by which a country house is valued its privacy levels the views it has and its proximity to other properties 5 why lower rates are no use the fed s twist programme was designed to lower longer term interest rates and spark borrowing and spending by households but the wsj reports here that even mortgage rates as low as 3 86 aren t working at this point the only people being helped are those who need it the least he said for the home sales market low rates will help make homes more affordable but may not boost home buying if consumers are worried about the economy today the buyers concern is the falling value of homes said mr barnes i ve had potential buyers say i don t care if rates are zero if prices are going to fall again 6 lower bank profits the ft s martin wolf writes an excellent blog post on how bank returns on equity have been way too high since the 1970s because they took on too much risk which eventually meant they had to be bailed out by taxpayers ht dan via email what would you say if someone offered you an investment with a promised real return of close to 15 per cent you might say how much can i buy alternatively you might say what is the catch sensible people must take the latter view if you thought that you were being offered a reliable real return at such an exalted level you would buy as much as you could this must be particularly true now when real returns on the bonds of relatively safe governments are close to zero so what is the catch the obvious answer has to be that the real return in question is extremely risky because it is volatile and offers a significant chance of total wipe out indeed it is perfectly obvious that these cannot be sustainable safe returns in economies growing at 2 per cent a year for such a large and well established industry at a 15 per cent real return the value of cumulative retained earnings would double in five years and increase 16 fold in 20 years pretty soon bank equity would be the only real asset in the world if a bank says it needs a real return on equity of 15 per cent to obtain funds from investors it is telling you that it is running an enormously risky business the question you need to ask yourself is this can we afford to have financial institutions that are both so large and so essential and yet run such huge risks i suggest the answer is no make them safer it really is not going to hurt 7 an extraordinary interview that turned out to be too good bad to be true independent trader alessio rastani says some hilarious stuff in this bbc interview below the governments don t rule the world goldman sachs does it turns out he s a independent trader living in a mortgaged house in a dodgy part of london here s the telegraph which found out he was an attention seeker not a trader they approached me he told the telegraph i m an attention seeker that is the main reason i speak that is the reason i agreed to go on the bbc trading is a like a hobby it is not a business i am a talker i talk a lot i love the whole idea of public speaking so he s more of a talker than a trader a man who doesn t own the house he lives in but can sum up the financial crisis in just three minutes a knack that escapes many financial commentators i agreed to go on because i m attention seeker he said on tuesday but i meant every word i said 8 greece s

tensions growing senate majority leader harry reid plans to propose a bill next week that would allow american companies to ask for counterveiling duties against chinese exports to america because of the overvaluation of the yuan here s reuters a key provision of the senate bill would instruct the commerce department to treat undervalued currencies as a subsidy under trade law allowing companies to ask for countervailing duties against imports on a case by case basis policymakers are already worried europe s debt crisis could undermine global growth a trade war between the united states and china would be more trouble the lawmakers argued china s currency is undervalued by as much as 25 percent to 40 percent against the dollar giving chinese companies an unfair price advantage and destroying millions of american jobs china rejects the criticism and last week a chinese foreign ministry official urged the united states to not politicize the renminbi s exchange rate because of u s

zimbabwe is again moving in the direction of a social explosion over the last few days mass protests against new austerity measures have spontaneously grown over into a general strike against the government the strike was formally announced to last for 72 hours from monday to wednesday but as we write these lines it is in effect still ongoing the economic crisis and its response by the government of forcing additional austerity measures onto the shoulders of ordinary working class people have sparked a furious response from the masses saturday s announcement by president emmerson mnangagwa that the price of fuel would increase overnight from 1 34 to 3 11 per litre seemed to be the last straw fuel prices are now among the most expensive in the world social eruption within hours of the announcement thousands of people spontaneously took the streets of the capital harare the protests then spread immediately to bulawayo and from there to all the way to the border with south africa masses of youths began to barricade roads in the harare suburbs of epworth and mabvuku then the situation developed rapidly on sunday public transport came to a standstill in harare when workers went on a wildcat strike protesters blocked highways and forced companies that had refused to shut their doors to comply with the strike the strike spread to other sectors throughout the city and then to the southern towns later in the day the zimbabwe congress of trade unions zctu announced a 72 hour general strike against the fuel hike in reality the zctu bureaucrats were lagging behind events the formal announcement when it came only recognised what was actually already happening on the ground saturday s announcement by president emmerson mnangagwa that the price of fuel would increase overnight from 1 34 to 3 11 per litre was the last straw for the masses image por on monday the strike spread throughout the country with increased militancy the state bankrupt both economically and politically is in no position to grant immediate concessions this explains the extreme brutality of the crackdown on these protests as usual riot police were sent to break up the demonstrations by force during heavy clashes the protesters succeeded in repelling the attacks by the police on more than one occasion in chitungwiza a town on the outskirts of the capital a police station was even stormed by protesters and burned down this posed a serious threat to the government the state then deployed the military on the streets immediately all internet access and telecommunications were cut across the country this blackout lasted for more than 30 hours social media platforms such as facebook twitter and whatsapp were all disabled all indications are that the crackdown during the blackout was brutal when communications were restored the zimbabwe association of doctors for human rights reported that during this period hospitals treated 172 people for serious injuries which included 68 people who have sustained gunshot wounds and more than 100 with dog bites initial reports say that between five and 10 people were killed and 600 arrested but despite this brutal response by the state it is clear that the crackdown failed to break the strike in fact it seems to have spurred it on the heavy response could explain in part why the strike is lasting past its 72 hour limit this is very dangerous for the regime if it fails to suppress the masses through brute force and the masses started to lose their fear the regime is basically living on borrowed time on wednesday soldiers continued to raid homes in harare s suburbs and townships and beat up people suspected of backing or taking part in the protests but later that day troop deployments were suddenly withdrawn in epworth and mabvuku instead army helicopters started shooting tear gas canisters into these high density townships of harare but the reason for the withdrawal doesn t seem to be tactical the main reason is the fear that the protesters could fraternise with the soldiers who are also affected by the country s currency problems in recent months the government even had big problems paying the salaries of the troops this would have the potential to split the army along class lines on thursday the entire transport system was still shut down the situation seemed to be calmer mainly because of the troop withdrawal from the townships to the city centres strike wave these events follow weeks of strikes in the public sector they comes on the back of a 40 day strike by doctors in december a strike by junior doctors resulted in 550 dismissals in response all doctors in the public sector went out on strike in solidarity this was preceded by a strike of teachers and nurses during the last two months of 2018 as a matter of fact this week s spontaneous general strike came just a week before planned strikes in the public sector in which more than 300 000 workers are expected to take part this strike therefore has the potential to develop into an all out general strike growing into next week which could have insurrectionary implications the government offered a 10 percent salary increase to public sector workers which would take effect in april 2019 but due to high inflation it was rightly rejected by the unions raymond majongwe of the progressive teachers union said we cannot see a government that is living in opulence and extravagance telling its workers to tighten their belts economic horror without end zimbabwe s economy is in dire straits inflation is on the rise there is a shortage of foreign currency and supplies of fuel while food and pharmaceuticals are drying up the country has a severe shortage of cash the zimbabwe dollar was wiped out by hyperinflation more than a decade ago the country then used a multi currency system including the us dollar and the south african rand then the introduction of so called bond notes in 2016 which were supposed to be equivalent to the dollar only made matters worse people saw this as an attempt to bring back the zimbabwe dollar they still remember the nightmare of hyperinflation these bond notes have now lost their value as people started to hoard us dollars which mainly became available on the black market these notes are not backed by any economic asset and are hardly worth the paper they are printed on this strike has the potential to develop into an all out general strike growing into next week which could have insurrectionary implications image simangele legodi the government tried to get out of the crisis by cutting down on imports which are far greater than zimbabwe s exports thus draining the country of foreign currency reserves but this is only exacerbating the crisis the country has a severe balance of payment crisis 2014 exports were worth 2 5 billion while imports were 6 25 billion a negative balance of 3 4 billion additionally the government was still paying the external debt which meant a constant depletion of foreign currency reserves now the prices of basic goods have more than tripled under the new administration of mnangagwa with a shortage of foreign currency leading to scarcities of everything from fuel to food mnangagwa is continuing with the same capitalist policies that have devastated the economy he made his programme clear in an article in the financial times last november the national budget must be balanced and spending reined in a large and inefficient public sector cannot be allowed to hold back private enterprise privatisation and reform of state owned enterprises are also key components of this strategy this was a declaration of war against public sector workers the result of this policy can now be seen in the state of the economy and the clashes in the streets the disastrous consequences of the imperialist policies the imf s structural adjustment programmes of the 1980s and 1990s were faithfully implemented by robert mugabe and his right hand man emmerson mnangagwa for the first two decades of their rule here are to be found the real roots of the current crisis not in the land expropriation of white farmers which followed later these measures devastated the country it was only when there was a revolt from below that mugabe for fear of losing power started attacking the imf and demagogically putting himself at the head of the land expropriation process in turn the economic and political zig zags of the mugabe regime exacerbated the crisis the crippling sanctions imposed by the west allegedly against human rights abuses by the regime only exacerbated the suffering of the masses in august 2018 us president donald trump signed the zimbabwe democracy and economic recovery amendment act zidera which extended these sanctions the european union and the us imposed sanctions against zimbabwe in 2000 after they accused ex president robert mugabe of trampling on human rights rigging elections and repressing press freedom the sanctions further devastated the economy pushing unemployment to about 85 percent these same western countries mainly britain and the united states propped up the zanu pf regime for decades when it was faithfully carrying out the dictates of the imf where was the moral outrage against human rights abuses when the regime carried out the gukurahundi massacres when between 1983 and 1987 in which more than 20 000 ndebele people were killed by the army s 5th brigade led by the current president emmerson mnangagwa instead mugabe was showered with praise accolades and honorary doctorates from western universities these sanctions had nothing to do with protecting human rights or democracy they were a direct response to mugabe dropping the imf structural adjustment programmes after they devastated the country an explosive situation there are reports of divisions between mnangagwa and chiwenga if the government fails to get back control the generals could decide to dispense with civilian rule image lemonzzandfreecolt the november 2017 coup that kicked out mugabe revealed a deep split in the regime decades austerity and capitalist crisis had completely undermined the zanu pf government after the coup military officers were deployed in the government including the head of the army constantino chiwenga who led the coup against mugabe now there are reports of deep divisions between mnangagwa and chiwenga if the government fails to get back control the generals could decide to step in yet again but this time they could decide to dispense with the niceties of civilian rule and impose direct rule in the form of a bonapartist military dictatorship then again given the situation it is possible the army itself could break along class lines which would make imposing such a regime very difficult on the other hand the masses have been pushed by the intolerable situation to take their destinies into their hands and now are losing fear of state repression this could lead to an insurrectionary situation which could bring down the government the problem facing the movement is that there is no revolutionary leadership in place zanu pf and the three factions of the opposition movement for democratic change are not capable of offering a real solution to the zimbabwean masses so long as capitalism exists there is no way out for the masses what is required is a workers party with a revolutionary socialist programme based on the expropriation of the land and industry such measures would encounter the resistance by reactionary forces within the country and imperialism but would resonate in the hearts of millions of workers throughout the continent and further the spark of revolution would land on very combustible material among the south african workers and youth and throughout the continent the revolutionary force of the working class and youth of zimbabwe is showing already that they can dislocate and overthrow the regime but the vacuum of power may be filled by parts of the existing ruling class by sections of the army or of the existing opposition who have no real solution to offer even in this case any attempt to restore order and move back to capitalist austerity will meet the resistance of the revolutionary youth and working class of zimbabwe which will be forced again and

expand ap photo chris o meara crashed how a decade of financial crises changed the world by adam tooze viking this article appears in the winter 2019 issue of the american prospect magazine subscribe here in 2009 i was summoned to the treasury department by the men who were launching the recovery from the global financial crisis at the time i was a state banking commissioner and had my hands full managing the waves of mortgage foreclosures inundating maryland communities the purpose of this meeting was to hear the distant provincial concerns i was raising as a leader of state financial regulatory officials about the spreading crisis in local housing markets i had some unfashionable and not ready for the policy elite views about why the post crisis economy wasn t improving and why household net worth was tumbling and destabilizing middle class and working class neighborhoods my perspective focused on the gritty and corrupt dynamics of the american mortgage system not the big picture washington narrative of global economic imbalances and the chinese american relationship at the treasury that day i argued for a so called look down to the cities towns and neighborhoods way below the power centers of wall street and k street to see what was happening in the offices of mortgage brokers and real estate appraisers the households of suddenly unemployed people trying to pay bloated mortgages on houses that had lost half their value and whole communities wiped out by predatory and discriminatory mortgages even in 2009 it was clear that the treasury and federal reserve rescue strategies were responding first and foremost to the needs of wall street where recovery of liquidity and capital would be the top order of business and only secondarily to the deepening crises on main street the side streets and the back streets to understand the total inadequacy of the establishment response not just how the immediate massive social and economic damage went unaddressed and became exacerbated but how the handling of the global financial crisis actually reinforced the dangerously inegalitarian structure of our global economy we have the gift of adam tooze s expansive timely and insightful treatise crashed how a decade of financial crises changed the world and a treatise it is clocking in at a dense but gripping 706 pages including all the reach for that magnifier footnotes the story is at once opaquely complex and dazzlingly simple for economists historians and policy advocates crashedis a globally comprehensive detail rich and riveting account of what happened and why but for citizens who may be impatient with all the intricacies of the global financial meltdown transatlantic financial linkages the crises buffeting greek society the strategic positioning by the people s bank of china the roller coaster ride of the russian ruble and its effects on putin s incursions into crimea and ukraine i can cut to the chase the financial system nearly collapsed but we saved it by massive government intervention without changing its basic dynamics of inequality instability and license for speculative private finance tooze s book leaves us with the inescapable conclusion that we need a new way as devastating as the crisis was the response by economic political elites around the world while minimally satisfactory and competent from a short term perspective is almost more frightening because it left us massively weakened economically with even sharper inequality and a stressed out middle class and politically even further adrift from viable strategies for inclusive democratic prosperity tooze illuminates the central role of the so called currency swap lines that the fed used to prop up the teetering world economy these currency swap lines were federal reserve loans extended to other countries central banks in exchange for those banks currencies to be repaid later with interest by september 2010 total lending and repayment on swap facilities had logged in at a whopping and unprecedented 10 trillion tooze shrewdly uncovers the federal reserve s liquidity operations showing how the fed made itself the lender of last resort to the world currency swap lines actually had been developed as a tool in the 1960s but were used sparingly and in decidedly lower amounts it was not until the september 11 attacks that they were dusted off and tested more expansively then in the run up to the global financial crisis as financial institutions in other countries confronted dollar shortages stemming from their need to repay other firms with greenbacks the use of currency swap lines took off and the fed became with little fanfare and even less public comprehension the lender of last resort to the planet just as the currency swap lines acted as a powerful tool to extinguish the systemic risk that was about to sink significant portions of the world s financial sector the fed turned another powerful fire hose on the economy with its unprecedented and accelerating rounds of monetary policy accommodation through the use of large scale assets purchases using the disarming name quantitative easing over nearly a decade qe1 qe2 and qe3 were continual confidence enhancing injections of cash into the markets with no end dates in sight the federal open market committee led the way with infusions upwards of 4 4 trillion followed by more liquidity from the european central bank and the bank of japan as tooze explains for anyone who missed the point these powerful tools the currency swap lines the funds that went to the so called too big to fail banks via the troubled asset relief program the liberal use of liquidity facilities and the successive injections of monetary accommodation via quantitative easing had a discrete set of immediate beneficiaries these instruments worked through the big banks through their executives and through the parts of the public that had invested in the stock market and could afford to keep their funds invested even during a prolonged downturn the direct beneficiaries were obviously not the people who had lost their homes to foreclosure and their jobs to globalization and automation the treasury s rhetoric of the day emphasized the need to save the system which it was assumed would save the people along with it the beneficiaries of the bailout it was believed would come to allocate credit on safe and affordable terms to households and businesses and they would efficiently distinguish avoidable foreclosures from unavoidable ones the theory was that mortgage servicers would be incentivized by profit to arrange prompt resells of the countless foreclosed homes that marred the american landscape with their overgrown yards out of control mold and broken pipes a lot of communities are still waiting for the market to work its magic the contrast between the solicitous care shown the culpable financial sector and the negligence shown to the innocent homeowner was startling i remember as a federal reserve governor going to new york in 2012 to speak to financiers and being thanked profusely by them for my work in ending the crisis but the next day i traveled to cleveland and saw packs of howling dogs scavenging at a boarded up factory and cash for gold vans parked in vacant kmart lots where the opioid crisis was already in full bloom the trickle down benefits of recovery seemed like a cruel joke in giant swaths of america where a deep discontent set in in what became the breeding grounds for the donald trump campaign the question that hovers over crashed is why the recovery strategies undertaken in the united states and abroad were so limited and selective in nature why was there so little in the policymaker s toolbox to help households especially those that had suffered the double whammy of a loss of a quality job and the loss of a home to be sure there were several well intended policy incursions to assist homeowners remember harp hamp and other loan modification efforts but they were straitjacketed by draconian rules set up to ensure that undeserving homeowners would not benefit a resolve wholly missing when it came to policies that benefited potentially undeserving banks and corporate executives but right wing ideology never far from the surface of public debate quickly found its bogeyman and asserted that undeserving homeowners should have known better than to be duped by their mortgage providers and should not be allowed to benefit from a reduction in the principal amount of their mortgages when it came time to help the american people instead of the american financial system the fire hose of financial aid had become an interval sprinkler timed to shut down as quickly as possible i saw the same effect when it came to unemployment insurance which progressive policymakers proposed strengthening and coupling with meaningful job training and retraining this idea was left on the drafting room floor like the idea that federal taxpayer injections of capital to the banks needed to be matched with concrete commitments by those banks to engage in direct lending to small businesses communities and consumers similarly the fed did nothing with the problem of america s 1 3 trillion now 1 44 trillion student loan debt despite the fact that it had become a ball and chain for millions of young people trying to launch their careers homes and families in short under the unimaginative and obsolescent dogmas of the washington consensus the benefits of the recovery went to some of the most culpable quarters and least deserving people and not to many of the americans who most needed them this was bad politics and bad economics too for inequality has itself become poised to be a critical drag on the economy the conventional verdict on the collapse superbly challenged by tooze is that the fed and the treasury took aggressive and sweeping actions to address the crisis and yes the american taxpayer has been by and large repaid for the mountains of cash we put up for the bailout but for all their boldness energy and magnitude these actions reinforced rather than reduced the dramatic disparities in wealth and income that have come to disfigure american democracy and drain our economy of strength tooze invites his readers to think of economics and politics as intertwined fields of play the political in political economy demands to be taken seriously he writes and he sees political choice ideology and agency as replete throughout this startling story these lessons teach us to be wary of claims that there are inescapable economic imperatives outside of politics just as they teach the champions of democracy to be ready with independent economists unbought political leaders and comprehensive economic plans to address and more importantly and more urgently to prevent the next global financial crisis
global economic growth is slowing under the weight of feuding politicians growing trade tensions and rising interest rates this week china injected us 84 billion into its banking system in an attempt to boost lending in its decelerating economy germany revealed its output barely grew in the fourth quarter of last year britain stumbled through yet more brexit related chaos and the u s government remained largely shuttered as president donald trump continued to butt heads with congress broad measures of what lies ahead for the global economy paint a downbeat picture a gauge of leading indicators maintained by the organization for economic co operation and development has slid to its lowest level since 2012 suggesting even more weakness is likely over the next few months meanwhile 60 per cent of money managers surveyed by bank of america merrill lynch expect growth across the world to weaken this year the most pessimistic such reading since 2008 we now think that global growth will fall by 2020 to its slowest pace since the financial crisis jennifer mckeown of capital economics wrote in a report this week she foresees a broad slowdown in north america the euro zone and china with growth in advanced economies tumbling from 2 2 per cent last year to a mere 1 per cent next year so time to stock up on tinned food and hunker down maybe not quite yet while there is broad agreement that the global economy is slowing the smart money is still betting on a relatively modest downshift in global growth only 14 per cent of the professional investors in the merrill lynch survey see a global recession in the cards for 2019 one reason for the muted optimism is the belief that policy makers still have lots of ammunition to fight any serious downturn for instance central banks could slow the rate at which they are raising interest rates or even go back to cutting rates the white house could also back off on its trade showdown with china any of these measures could help counteract any potential weakness for now employment is booming in canada and the united states and corporate earnings are still strong the current ratcheting down in overall growth was predicted and simply reflects the fading boost from u s tax cuts and stimulus a year ago according to robin brooks chief economist at the institute of international finance a financial services organization in washington the glass is still half full he argues a similar viewpoint comes from andrew hollenhorst at citigroup he expects u s growth to slow slightly this year but still tick in at a healthy 2 6 per cent down only marginally from 2 9 per cent in 2018 he largely dismisses talk of a recession any time soon and expects the u s federal reserve to hike interest rates a couple of times over the course of the year while a recession scenario that would involve fed cuts in 2019 is certainly possible it is not probable he wrote in a report the challenge for forecasters is that many of the largest risks fall into the category of politics not economics nobody knows how mr trump s shambolic administration will proceed on the government showdown or on broader matters of trade and tariffs it s equally difficult to predict the brexit soap opera or euro zone policy as a whole the biggest enigma of all is china which has accounted for roughly 30 per cent of global growth in recent years the asian giant has engineered its rapid expansion by directing vast amounts of capital into infrastructure projects real estate and heavy industry the limits of that approach are now apparent china s working age population is declining and productivity gains have slowed as the incremental payoff from building even more apartments railways roads and airports begins to wane diminishing returns from investment are combining with large amounts of debt as well as trade tensions with the united states to discourage chinese consumption and drag on growth the measures unveiled by beijing this week to stimulate its economy are welcome but at best will stabilize the situation according to capital economics whether china will go further to reignite growth or how is anyone s guess the united states the other pillar of global prosperity offers a more transparent case of an economy going through a difficult transition in its case the transition involves weaning consumers and businesses off a decade of remarkably low interest rates car sales and home construction have plateaued since the fed began raising rates two years ago in recent weeks the stock market has developed a bad case of the jitters as mounting trade tensions and sliding oil prices offer more reasons for worry the government shutdown is only adding to the anxious mood the fed s latest beige book account of business sentiment published this week found that businesses had become less optimistic in response to increased financial market volatility rising short term interest rates falling energy prices and elevated trade and political uncertainty many of the same factors are also casting shadows over the canadian outlook in its most recent monetary policy report released earlier this month the bank of canada trimmed its forecast for growth in gross domestic product this year to a mere 1 7 per cent from the more robust 2 1 per cent it had predicted a few months previously the central bank expects growth to rebound in 2020 but it acknowledges several risks most notably a sharp decline in home prices could depress consumer spending and construction activity recent readings on that front are not encouraging home prices are sliding in several canadian cities according to the teranet national bank house price index in december the percentage of local markets with rising prices fell to its lowest level in five years the message here investors and executives should not assume a global slowdown is inevitable but should be vigilant for further signs of weakness one key indicator will come on monday when china reports on how fast its economy grew in the fourth quarter in the third quarter the asian giant s gdp growth declined to 6 5 per cent the lowest quarterly figure since early 2009 any evidence that the situation has deteriorated further in the final three months of the year could spook markets most analysts expect a reading of 6 4 per cent for the fourth quarter if the number on monday ticks in substantially below that level brace for some fireworks

tariffs world stocks measured by the msci all country index rose to their highest level and looked set for its fourth straight week of gains marking its longest winning streak in six months on bay street futures were also higher as oil rose on reports suggesting a sharp reduction in opec output last month it seems almost impossible to sensibly gauge where us china relations stand yet the market hangs on each headline highlighting just how sensitive it is to the ongoing trade issue jasper lawler head of research for london capital group said this would not be the first time that we have heard reports of thawing trade tensions the markets have been here before so there is going to be a level of caution on thursday the wall street journal reported that u s treasury secretary steven mnuchin talked about lifting some or all tariffs imposed on chinese imports and suggested a tariff rollback during trade talks set for the end of the month the u s treasury however denied mr mnuchin had made such a recommendation chinese vice premier liu he will visit the u s on jan 30 and 31 for a continuation of trade talks between the two nations heading into the trading day shares of netflix inc were

producing cars for about a decade and we re up against massive entrenched competitors he said on bay street traders got the latest reading on inflation statistics canada said the consumer price index fell 0 1 per cent in december from november economists were expecting a decline of about 0 4 per cent the annual rate of inflation meanwhile rose to 2 per cent from 1 7 per cent in november the headline figure had been expected to hold relatively steady cibc economist royce mendes noted that the stronger than expected reading on headline inflation reflected a recent change to methodology related to how airline fares are calculated the effect he said should be short lived looking through all the volatility the bank of canada s three core measures remained steady from the prior month averaging just a touch below 2 per cent he said all told the loonie is rallying off the higher than expected headline but could come back after investors digest the details overseas easing trade

the drop also came before the january start of production cut by opec and its allies with members and others pledging to reduce production by 1 2 million barrels a day oil has been another benefactor of the improvement in risk appetite oanda analyst craig erlam said this time last month doom and gloom had engulfed the markets and people s expectations for 2019 were becoming more pessimistic by the day weighing heavily on oil prices the bounce in markets and improvements on the fundamental outlook have prompted a similar rebound in oil which is continuing today mr erlam said wti and brent face significant test around us 55 and us 65 respectively momentum is very much with the bulls and i wouldn t be surprised if they re broken in the not too distant future he said however a report friday by the international energy agency also suggested rising u s production and slowing global economic growth will create headwinds for the oil market this year in a report the iea said it was keeping its

56 us cents economists had expected the annual rate to hold closer to 1 7 per cent in the latest report statscan says lower energy prices were offset by higher costs for services like air transportation telephone services and travel tours excluding gasoline prices the consumer price index rose at an annual rate of 2 5 per cent the agency said meanwhile it its latest currency outlook cibc says a continued rebound in oil should help lift the canadian dollar in the near term a recovery in oil prices and export volumes should allow the to raise rates near mid year supporting the loonie cibc said but more broadly the c is still a range bound story unlikely to benefit from dxy u s dollar index softness given canada s persistent current account gap and need to do better on exports as housing slows on broader markets the u s dollar was steady against a basket of world counterparts and looked set for its first weekly gain in five early friday the u s dollar index was

source facing reality transformed china the zimbabwe independent january 18 2019 the most remarkable economic turnaround story of the 21st century undoubtedly belongs to the people s republic of china as the country marks the 40th anniversary of economic reforms and opening the world looks back at the rise of the new dragon in world economics the country s rapid economic transformation is puzzling as it generates a great deal of skepticism in equal measure how could a nation with 1 386 billion people transform itself so rapidly from a vastly impoverished agricultural economy into a formidable industrial powerhouse when so many tiny nations have been unable to do so despite their more favourable socio economic conditions how could their economic reforms be so effective in such a short space of time to change the scope of a capitalist based global trade order according to the world bank china transformed from a us 192 billion economy in 1980 to a us 13 trillion economy as of october 2018 with an average gdp growth rate of 10 since 1990 no county can beat china in terms of long term sustained and high growth in its economy it has taken china only 30 odd years to achieve what took other countries several decades or even more than a hundred years this transformation lifted over 800 million people out of poverty and placed the country firmly as the second largest economy in the world after the usa china s economic story paints a picture so clear it requires most developing nation s especially african countries to take notes on economic reforms export led growth investment policies research and development strategies agriculture transformation and import policies in 1980 china s per capita income was only us 220 one third of sub saharan africa s per capita income today sub saharan africa per capita income is us 1 560 while that of china is us 10 047 6 times more china has grown to be the world s largest manufacturing country as it produces nearly 50 of the globe s major industrial goods including crude steel cement coal automobiles and industrial patent applications china is also the world s largest producer of ships high speed trains robots tunnels bridges highways chemical fibers machine tools computers cellphones and other small merchandise mainly consumed in developing countries china is the world s largest trading nation with exports valued over us 2 26 trillion and imports of us 1 84 trillion thereby generating a trade surplus of us 42 billion what makes chinese trade a marvel is that its largest trading partners are the united states european union and japan who account for over 53 of the global economic output china also holds the world s largest reserves of foreign currency valued at over us 3 062 trillion as of november 2018 china reached all the set millennium development goals mdgs by 2015 and made a major contribution to the achievement of the mdgs globally since it accounts for 20 of the world s population china s growth has reduced poverty with only 3 3 of the population living below the poverty line set at 2300 yuan us 333 it is evident that chinese growth was hinged on industrial exports which account for over 95 of the country s export earnings however there are a lot of economic policies that the chinese nailed in order to rapidly industrialise the country in december 1978 china s free market principles under deng xiaoping sign posted a turning point in its economic management and trajectory for this to happen the country s leadership had to accept the painful truth that maoist version of the centrally planned economy had failed to produce efficient economic growth and had caused china to fall far behind not only the industrialised nations of the west but also the new industrial powers of asia such as japan south korea singapore taiwan and hong kong during the years of the centrally planned economy citizens had to grapple with rationed clothing basic shortages inadequate housing high inflation rates and a service sector that was inefficient deng s policies strengthened the authority of institutional managers and economic decision makers at the expense of party officials from the chinese communist party the effect of this policy was to separate economic policy from political interference and ensure efficient allocation of resources to economic development the country also improved its investment policies by allowing investment into high tech industries and exchanging manufactured goods for technology the growth in technology oriented research and development also meant the cost of production for various goods gradually went down the purpose of the reform program was not to abandon communism but to make it work better by substantially increasing the role of market mechanisms in the economy through reducing not eliminating government planning and direct control by 1987 the program had achieved remarkable results in increasing supplies of food fuel and other consumer goods which helped to control inflation a new climate of dynamism entrepreneurship and opportunity in the economy had improved the quality of goods and services in the economy the first years of reforms looked at economic re adjustment during which the major goals of the re adjustment process were to earn foreign currency by growing exports rapidly through establishing export hubs and overcome key deficiencies in transportation communications coal iron steel building materials and electric power that were the major cost drivers in the economy the government also sought to redress the imbalance between light and heavy industry by increasing the growth rate of light industry which makes the bulk of chinese exports and reducing investment in heavy industry during an era of the first industrial revolution agricultural production was stimulated in 1979 by an increase of over 22 in the procurement prices paid for farm products the move was meant to reward key producers of rice wheat potatoes tomato sorghum peanuts tea millet barley cotton oilseed and soybeans this phase featured the sprouting of millions of rural enterprises from 1 5 million to 18 9 million and growth in gdp from agriculture food security was achieved and aggregate wages for farmers increased 12 fold the second industrial revolution featured policies oriented toward mass production of goods for the domestic and international markets it also looked at massive investment into energy transport communication and industrial infrastructure in agriculture driven country sides because of the rapidly and enormously expanding domestic market for intermediate goods machinery and transportation there was a big surge in the consumption and production of coal steel cement chemical fibers machine tools highways bridges tunnels and ships in all 2 6 million miles 3 9 million km of public roads were built including more than 70 000 miles 105 000km of express highways twenty eight provinces out of 30 have high speed trains the result was that cost of production drastically fell and made chinese products attractive on the world market infrastructure investments also opened up markets for various producers in the local market and abroad through export led cities at the country s borders the growth of the chinese economy can be termed as the triumph of marketism free markets impose economic incentives to compete profits impose discipline on management so as to control risk and on technology adoption so as to improve quality and control cost of production it also promotes destructive innovation where inefficient producers monopolies and bureaucratic structures fall foreign investment inflows grew rapidly post 1990 according to the 2018 world investment report published by unctad china was ranked the world s second largest foreign direct investment fdi recipient after united states the country s economy was ranked the second most attractive to multinational companies for 2017 2019 fdi inflows continue to increase between 2016 and 2017 from us 133 billion to us 136 billion this growth is favoured by economic liberalisation policies the rapid development of the high tech sector and the establishment of free trade zones the absorption of fdi is part of the policy of opening china to the outside world aiming at creating a better business environment structures and distribution of investment across the country the government s efforts to achieve a better geographical spread of investments have allowed central china to see its fdi increase over 35 652 foreign funded companies were set up in china in 2017 thanks to the large base of internal customers china s favourable investment tag is hinged on the importance of foreign currency reserves and effective public debt management by chinese government labour costs remain comparatively low in the region for global brands manufacturers such as nike coca cola kfc apple toyota mitsubishi samsung hyundai lg and kia who operate in the country among others despite fears of massive pollution caused by rapid industrialization overcrowding in shanghai corruption by top government officials and massive debt overhang from funding state owned entities soes china s will surely weather the storms of the negative impact of its massive economic growth the chinese government s spending on key infrastructure

this article is brought to you thanks to the collaboration of the european sting with the world economic forum author guy standing professorial research associate school of oriental and african studies university of london as a long time proponent of basic income and as someone who has been involved in pilots in four continents the past year has been a roller coaster perhaps summarised as two steps forward one step back with marks for progress as six out of 10 it will take acts of courage to move forward decisively in 2019 but more doors are opening there has been a ferment of activity perhaps what has happened in canada and the united states captures the contrasting fortunes best though events in europe and elsewhere are encouraging too a highlight was the 18th international congress of bien basic income earth network in tampere finland which brought hundreds of academics and activists from around the world to discuss developments there were also several significant books and the world bank endorsed basic income as a development tool in its world development report north america the debate in canada and the usa has gone in two directions the introduction of basic income as an alternative to existing social policies paid from direct taxation and the development of capital funds with dividends the first have been implicit in pilots and demonstration projects at the outset of the year basic income pilots were underway in three communities of ontario hamilton lindsay and thunder bay covering 4 000 individuals though like most other experiments these were not tests of a full basic income they had many features of a proper basic income early reports were uniformly favourable and polls showed it was popular so much so that the conservatives contesting the provincial election said the pilots would be continued if they were elected however on taking office doug ford terminated the pilots and ordered that data collected for the evaluation be surrendered undaunted videos circulated on social media reporting on how participants had been responding there was also an unexpected postscript in december the canadian prime minister justin trudeau and the social development minister jean yves duclos said in interviews that a guaranteed national minimum income could be an option as they sought ways to support canadians to adapt to an unsteady shifting labour market duclos predicted it would come in the usa barack obama in a reflective speech in south africa mused that basic income would figure prominently in the years ahead and prominent corporate folk endorsed it again including mark zuckerberg and elon musk but mainly it was a year of positioning by potential democrat presidential candidates with contenders offering proposals with elements of basic income one andrew yang has made it his core policy proposal there was an encouraging buzz around the pronouncements of the young mayor of stockton in california who has taken a different route launching a demonstration project whereby thanks to a grant of 1 million from facebook co founder chris hughes 100 individuals from low income areas will be provided with a monthly basic income of 500 for 18 months the project was held up by the process of sending invitations to 1 000 randomly chosen individuals from which the 100 are to be selected but it should go ahead in february 2019 in chicago a large group of legislators has proposed a pilot and at the end of the year the proposal was awaiting the approval of the mayor if it takes off it will be the largest such pilot in the usa also encouraging is the pilot launched in four american cities in which 1 000 low income mothers will receive an unconditional 333 a month for 40 months from their child s birth in a project named baby s first years because the focus is on the link between basic income security and brain development in another pilot also best described as a demonstration project the magnolia mother s trust started to provide 15 low income african american women in mississippi with 1 000 a month unconditionally in december 2018 although it took place in 2017 another development that crystallised in 2018 that could become a harbinger of responses to natural and social disasters was the response by dolly parton the country music star to the wildfire devastation of her hometown of gatlinburg tennessee she put millions of dollars into my people s fund from which 1 000 per month was to be paid to about 900 families for six months so many other donations were made that this was increased to 5 000 in the final month an analysis showed that the money not only enabled people to acquire housing but led to increased work not less meanwhile leading democrats were tumbling out proposals senator cory booker introduced a bill proposing that lower income children receive 1 000 each year paid into special savings accounts with the amount rising to 2 000 if their families are poor paid by higher capital gains and estate taxes the accounts would be blocked until they reached age 18 when they would be permitted to use the money for asset building purchases this deviates from a basic income being paternalistic not trusting people with the ability to decide what was best for themselves would require costly bureaucratic monitoring and would raise the problem of weakness of will as is the case with all capital grant schemes but it reflects the realisation that the distribution system has broken down senator kamala harris put forward a bill to subsidise rent through a refundable tax credit on federal income taxes which was quickly seen as more likely to enrich landlords than give basic income security to low income tenants critics pointing out that a basic income would do more to help those tenants harris proposed the lift livable incomes for families today the middle class act offering 250 a month for singles 500 for couples phasing that out as earnings rose a drawback is that somebody earning nothing would receive nothing while somebody would need to earn at least 3 000 to receive the full benefit representative bonnie watson coleman proposed a bill designed to overcome one regressive failing of the earned income tax credit scheme that currently eats up 65 billion a year it would extend eitc benefits to family caregivers and students like tax credits elsewhere the eitc has rested on an arbitrary conceptualisation of what is work and what is not recognising that is at least a step in the direction of a basic income tax credits are regressive depressing wages and subsidising low wage employers meanwhile there have been developments around the second route to basic income around social or common dividends again there has been one setback the starting idea is that natural resources are part of the commons they belong to everybody the commoners if anybody or a corporation exploits them for commercial gain they owe a rent to the commoners this view goes back through the centuries epitomised by the thinking of philosophers such as john locke and the founding fathers of the united states such as thomas jefferson and thomas paine and through the writings of henry george and later economists this has led to renewed interest in land value tax eco taxes or levies and digital levies but the main examples in practice have been based on royalties on oil the leading scheme where royalties are channelled into a permanent capital fund from which equal dividends are paid is the alaska permanent fund set up in 1976 and paying annual dividends to every alaskan resident since 1982 this has proved remarkably popular until 2011 the value of the dividends rose steadily but successive republican governors had imprudently cut income tax to zero so when oil prices fell government debt rose leading to the most recent governor raiding the fund to pay government operating costs leading to a collapse in the annual dividends this was rightly seen as a tax hitting low income people and led to a dive in the governor s popularity and withdrawal from his re election campaign in october 2018 the revival of alaska dividends will depend on who succeeds him but the idea of capital funds is gaining ground the major development in 2018 was rising support for taxes on greenhouse gas emissions the global scientific community is unanimous that climate change is a giant threatening humanity and nature and that radical action is required to tackle it among other measures that requires big taxes or levies on c02 there are two problems taxes are unpopular and carbon tax is regressive in 2018 canada moved to confront both problems by combining a carbon tax with the promise of dividends to be paid to all under the greenhouse gas pollution pricing act starting in 2019 the carbon tax is too modest to bring down emissions substantially but the act has established a principle although the oil industry is contesting it and predictably the right wing ontario premier doug ford has called it the worst tax ever the new tax will increase gasoline prices by 42 cents a gallon 11 cents a litre or by 8 but cleverly the act is intended to be revenue neutral with all revenue returned to the provinces from which it is generated and with 90 given back to individuals as rebates the remaining 10 going to organisations affected by the tax such as schools and hospitals the rebates will mean that about 70 of canadian households will receive more back than they pay in tax this is in all but name and certainty of amount a basic income and it is progressive in november 2018 a bipartisan group in the us house of representatives introduced a bill similar to the canadian reform proposing to tax emissions and redistribute the proceeds as dividends it will be doomed as long as donald trump s fellow climate change deniers control the senate but it too offers a promising route into funding a basic income system a similar plan has been promoted by former government officials backed by major corporations such as at t p g johnson johnson gm and pepsico and financially backed by exxonmobil so in north america the idea is taking hold that revenue can be raised from commercial uses of the commons or natural resources and from commercial deductions from the commons in the form of pollution observers should note related proposals in chicago the innovative alderman ameya pawar floated a plan to public tize chicago s water system giving shares to all city residents and paying them dividends that would be a sort of basic income according to him as chicago has a lot of fresh water it should be seen as a public resource just as oil is treated in alaska finally the us debate has been accentuated by the proposal by newly elected new york representative alexandria ocasio cortez backed by at least 40 members of congress for a green new deal which includes a monthly basic income no doubt the deal will prove controversial in its original form but it surely points in the necessary direction image european social survey europe while proposals were bubbling in north america european debates became more prominent and more politicians and political parties came out in favour while us economist joseph stiglitz has dismissed basic income in the uk saying it is a cop out i do not believe it is what people want there is evidence to the contrary a populus survey in britain found that 41 supported basic income and only 17 were against the remainder saying they did not know a european wide survey covering 23 countries found strong public support across the continent the most striking development came in italy leaving basic income proponents with mixed feelings the populist party movimento cinque stelle campaigned in the general election on a platform that included what it called a basic income which proved remarkably attractive in southern italy and has been described by most analysts as the main reason for their success in becoming the largest party in parliament and now part of the government what m5s is offering is actually not a basic income but the fact that it proved so popular was further evidence that some of its critics are out of touch pilots have been spreading in 2017 there was worldwide publicity around what was purported to be a government basic income pilot in finland in mid 2018 the bbc and the guardian newspaper almost gleefully reported that it was being ended prematurely this was reported in media around the world and repeated in blogs on social media the story was wrong the original intention announced before the pilot begin in 2017 was that it would last for two years up to the end of december 2018 this is precisely what happened journalists had misinterpreted a statement by a new right wing finance minister that the pilot would not be extended because he was opposed to it the government moved towards a workfare regime requiring all unemployed to attend trimonthly interviews and increased the waiting period for receipt of unemployment benefits and the period of eligibility a utilitarian approach was in ascendancy in which a more punitive regime closer to the uk s universal credit system was being implemented which led to thousands losing entitlement to social assistance but this had nothing to do with what was happening in the basic income pilot the finnish pilot is not testing proper basic income but is a test of characteristics consistent with it it provided 560 a month to 2 000 randomly selected registered unemployed from across the country relaxing the rule that they must prove they are searching for jobs and allowing them to retain the benefit if they found one early reports from the evaluation by kela the official social insurance organisation are encouraging a report will be published in 2019 in november 2018 the opposition party left alliance announced that its manifesto for the general election scheduled for 2019 would include a commitment to a basic income of 800 a month phasing out means tested social assistance while leaving housing allowance unchanged the basic income would be taxed away from high income earners and it would be phased in by consolidating various social security benefits in the netherlands partial basic income pilots were under way in groningen tilburg utrecht and wageningen the experiments follow from legislation in 2015 that allowed local authorities to experiment with social policies initially the pilots seemed closer to workfare but local authorities have found ways to make them closer to a basic income although they suffer from being limited to welfare claimants and being provided only to randomly selected individuals not whole communities as in finland they are best described as trust experiments to see how people respond when not subject to behavioural conditionality another experiment is underway in barcelona under the name b mincome which has been running since october 2017 and is scheduled to last until late 2019 again its proponents see it as a basic income but the money is being provided on a family basis not individual it is being provided to 1 000 participant families with 500 others as a control group when launched it was stated that the main intention was to analyse the most effective way of reducing inequality and breaking the poverty cycle in switzerland much attention was stimulated by an initiative by a swiss film maker to launch a pilot in rheinau a village in the canton of zurich the idea was to induce 650 residents to volunteer to be recipients from a village population of about double that and to crowdfund a rather large basic income for one year varying the amount by age group those earning more than chf2 500 would have to repay it as their income rose as with the earlier swiss referendum the initiative suffered from putting the basic income at a high level reaching as much as chf2 500 for those aged over 25 at the end of the year the crowdfunding was short however observers seem agreed that the initiative attracted much public support in the area in germany a basic income pilot provocatively named hartzplus is set to start in may 2019 in berlin with a random sample of 250 recipients of state benefits and with another 250 as a control group with a focus on evaluating the impact on labor market behaviour health and social relations it is set to last for three years and follows crowdfunded schemes that have proven popular in germany notably mein grundeinkommen my basic income that has been running a lottery with winners obtaining a monthly basic income of 1 000 for one year meanwhile the chief executive of germany s association of towns and municipalities dstgb lamenting the over burdened bureaucratic welfare state and rising poverty came out in favour of basic income in the uk an initiative was launched in scotland where four areas fife edinburgh glasgow and north ayrshire began preparing feasibility and design plans aided by a grant of 250 000 from the scottish government and backed by a cross party group of members of the scottish parliament the green party has also come out strongly in favour of a basic income and in mid 2018 the shadow chancellor of the exchequer committed labour to proposing pilots in its next manifesto and commissioned a report by this author on why and how those should be done in sum the debate on basic income has moved into the mainstream in european policymaking probably propelled by concern over the eight giants discussed in the companion piece to this progress report among the findings of relevance to crystallise in the past year on both sides of the atlantic is that a large and growing proportion of those in income poverty are in households in which at least one person is in a job 80 in the case of the usa 60 in the uk for example but high private debt insecurity inequality precarity concern over the advancing robots and worries about populism are surely behind the growing interest basic income elsewhere towards the end of the year there was a buzz in the indian media around stories that prime minister modi might include commitment to a basic income in the bjp manifesto for the general election in april 2019 some mps have come out in favour and in several states local plans have been developed these initiatives derive in part from the successful pilots conducted in west delhi and madhya pradesh and a much cited chapter in the minister of finance s annual report in january 2017 it is widely accepted now that some sort of basic income for india is financially feasible there have been political moves in several other asian countries thus the head of the malaysian prime minister s council of eminent persons proposed that the hugely expensive subsidy system br1m should be replaced by a national fund from which dividends would be paid as monthly basic incomes in china a national network was established to promote basic income which has highlighted the success of a basic income scheme in huaidi in shijiazhuang and in south korea the youth dividend scheme launched by the mayor of seongnam city gained considerable popularity and political interest across the country the biggest pilot took off in kenya where givedirectly launched its flagship scheme this is set to last for 12 years covering 21 000 adults with monthly payments coming to about half the average income of low income households this obviously ambitious pilot is generating much interest however it will be years before evaluations of its impact will be available and one should be concerned with research fatigue what it has done is boost interest in basic income among policymakers everywhere besides the world bank s sudden conversion revealed in its world development report 2018 various imf papers have recommended basic income again reversing previous imf positions and world bank reviews of the evidence from across developing countries have refuted again arguments that cash transfers lead to more spending on private bads more dependency and less work and negative community effects while being fiscally unsustainable if only those financial bodies had not opposed those of us pushing for basic income for so many years we might be further ahead today than we are but it would be churlish not to wish them success in their advocacy in the year ahead selling basic income during 2018 discussion of the likely cost of a basic income became more informed for instance one study estimated that a 2 financial wealth tax would be sufficient to fund a 12 000 annual basic income for every us household studies in the uk suggested that by replacing many existing benefits and raising the income tax rate by 3 a decent basic income could be afforded others estimated that it could be paid from levies on wealth land value and incursions into the commons during the year it became more widely appreciated that generous personal tax exemptions in the usa and increasingly generous personal tax allowance in the uk are a perverse form of basic income an upside down income support program the rich get more than the middle class and the middle class get more than the poor as one american commentator put it this is in so much as they cost as much in public revenue as would a modest basic income but are regressive since the gain in tax free income is greater for higher income taxpayers and greater for those who have enough income to pay taxes than for those who have none what must be researched more in the year ahead are the feedback and multiplier effects basic incomes have been shown to boost work productivity and incomes which foster taxable income and lower social costs but how great are those effects all simulation models and cost estimates so far have ignored feedback effects for instance there is ample evidence that basic income security improves mental and physical health which reduces spending on health services improves productivity and reduces poverty so the net cost of a basic income would be less than the simple budgetary cost but we do not have good estimates of how much savings would result
18 01 2019 us debt bomb or overblown geopoliticalmonitor com the latest report from the congressional budget office cbo is enough to curdle the blood of any fiscal conservative according to the report us federal debt held by the public relative to gdp currently stands at 78 percent debt issued in treasury securities if current trends hold that number will reach 100 percent of gdp by the end of the decade and 152 percent of gdp by 2048 broadly speaking the expansion is being fueled by outlays for social security and medicare and increasingly burdensome interest payments on preexisting debt the country s darkening fiscal outlook is sure to resonate in future elections in the united states but there s a crucial international dimension here as well background spending growth will contribute to widening deficits over the next 30 years the cbo predicts that social security spending will grow from 4 9 percent of gdp in 2018 to 6 3 percent in 2048 health care programs including medicare and medicaid among others will rise from 5 2 percent to 8 7 percent mostly on the back of an aging population and high healthcare costs per person and interest payments will balloon from 1 6 percent to 5 3 percent annual deficits are projected to rise from 3 9 percent in 2018 to 8 4 percent in 2048 discretionary spending relative to gdp over the same period is expected to fall if nothing because the budgetary math increasingly won t allow for it discretionary spending was 6 3 percent of gdp in 2018 the cbo expects that number to fall to 5 5 percent by 2048 revenues are expected to remain flat for the next few years and then jump in 2026 when income tax cuts from this year s tax act are set to expire revenues would then grow in step with the economy but they would still fail to keep pace with spending growth impact the cbo projections are grim enough as is but the reality could turn out even worse the cbo makes various assumptions when calculating its estimates assumptions on growth interest rates productivity and labor participation and while there is some room on the upside for better than expected overall results for example if the political will materialized in washington to address the debt problem sooner rather than later there s considerable downside risks as well interest rates one such risk stems from unforeseen fluctuations in interest rates the post 2009 era has seen unprecedentedly low rates which have produced a favorable borrowing environment for the us government the cbo foresees the yield on 10 year treasuries rising to 3 7 percent by 2028 and then 4 8 percent in 2048 the average yield from the period of 1990 2007 was 5 8 percent bond yields are a product of supply and demand there has been ample supply as us governments over the past two decades have sought outside funding to fill their deficit gaps but what about demand the united states government has always benefitted from crisp foreign demand for us treasuries which are seen as a safe haven asset denominated in a global and relatively stable currency critically nearly all global oil sales are settled in usd countries like japan and china have amassed huge reserves of us government debt holding some 1 030 trillion and 1 179 trillion in treasuries respectively as of early 2018 their purchases of us debt serve to depress yields which in turn makes it cheaper for the us government to borrow and finance its agenda at home and abroad there s reason to believe that us treasuries will be less appealing for foreign governments over the short to medium term one consistent drag will stem from the united states growing debt pile not insofar that it represents a risk of default per se but rather a risk of currency devaluation in order to make the debt easier to pay off at some point in the future if the us dollar tanks it makes foreign treasury holdings less valuable relative to the local currency in question there s also the fact that as states move further along the development curve maintaining large holdings of foreign exchange becomes less crucial to their economic stability we re already seeing signs of this as japanese and chinese investors start to divest from treasuries such divestment is sure to proceed slowly so as not to cause a panic and impact the value of a country s remaining holdings china in particular has been especially circumspect over the past year presumably because it doesn t want to give the impression it s triggering the nuclear option in its ongoing trade war with the united states that nuclear option would be a liquidation of its usd denominated reserves a move that would cause us treasury yields to surge but severely undercut the value of china s remaining holdings in the process usd denominated assets have been the global the benchmark for foreign reserves since the gold standard was abandoned in the 20th century this may not always be the case but for now usd primacy is definitely bolstered by a lack of credible alternatives the euro is held in the reserve portfolio of various governments but the spectre of greece and perennial risks to the long term stability of the euro zone continue to relegate the currency to a secondary position behind the usd the renminbi is another possible alternative but it remains illiquid as a global currency barring a wave of new reforms in china the situation could well change in the 30 years considered by these cbo projections especially if the expected debt accumulation actually comes to pass in other words just like the gold standard that preceded it the us dollar may not always be viewed as the standard bearer of global finance and if a reckoning does eventually occur it will surely have been expedited by the precarious fiscal outlook of the us government growth shocks another realistic contingency that the cbo outlook ignores is a systemic shock like the 2008 2009 great recession tough to predict these events can scuttle even the most exacting economic projections in 2007 the us debt stood at just 35 percent of gdp nearly half of its current level post 2009 simulative policy responses were spend heavy impacting the government s bottom line in ways that still resonate to this day one 2012 estimate from the us treasury put the total exposure for us taxpayers at 24 trillion in response to the great recession and that s just on the spending side of the equation in terms of revenues systemic economic shocks can wipe out trillions of household wealth hollow out the employment market for several years and undercut the government s tax base though in some respects us taxpayers actually gained when distressed assets and treasuries were eventually sold off the cbo projections use a baseline of 1 9 percent annual growth for the next 30 years the rate is lower than the historical average of 2 8 percent owing in large part to tepid growth of the us labor pool forecast we re still well within the bounds of normalcy here washington is ignoring the long term track of government finances and the global financial system is still dominated by wall street notwithstanding a few early signs of dissent such as calls in the eu for an alternative system for the continent and the proliferation of bilateral deals to settle trade accounts in local currencies us debt levels also remain within elevated but acceptable limits at 78 percent gdp with a deficit of just under 4 percent but it s from here on out where the normalcy potentially dissipates at least if the cbo projections prove correct the borrowing binge of the past decade was aided by record low yield rates thanks to qe and the uncertain fate of the euro zone now yields are normalizing and so too is the long term fiscal impact of the government deficit which in turn drives upward pressure on borrowing rates as demand for treasuries dries up in other words us finances are now entering a dangerous cycle of debt begetting more debt it will take rare political will to right the country s fiscal ship and the sooner it arrives the less pain there will be over the long run however should washington politicians continue to ignore the problem we could be looking at a very different global financial system by the time the cbo projections end date of 2048 finally rolls around originally published on november 14 2018
macroeconomic outlook for 2019 and gold will 2019 be better than 2018 for the yellow metal we invite you to read our today s article painting the macroeconomic outlook for 2018 and learn whether fundamental factors will become less or more friendly toward gold what will 2019 be like we do not know the precise answer but we notice a few important economic trends that will shape the new year 1 interest rates will continue to rise 2 however the fed s monetary tightening will slow down 3 just when the ecb will start normalizing its own monetary policy 4 and when the stimulus of the us fiscal policy will start to dissipate we will analyze them now for you as we believe that investors need a clear guide to navigate themselves through choppy waters of our volatile economy without a broader fundamental perspective it s easy to get lost in the thicket of daily news as we predicted the long term interest rates climbed in 2018 see the chart below we expect them to rise further this year this is because the fed will continue its tightening cycle even if it pauses for a while higher short term rates should translate into higher real long term rates chart 1 us nominal green line and real red line interest rates from january 2014 to december 2018 moreover the us fiscal deficit will exert upward pressure on the interest rates as treasury will have to compete for limited funds and with stronger inflationary pressure in 2018 than in the last few years people may demand higher inflation premium pushing the interest rates further this trend will exert downward pressure on the gold prices as higher rates mean a raise in opportunity costs of holding gold they also support the us dollar the greatest enemy of the yellow metal at the same time we do not expect that inflation will get out of control so the demand for gold as an inflation hedge should remain in dormancy however the fed s monetary tightening will slow down the fed started moving away from zirp in 2015 hiking its interests rates in december by 0 25 basis points in 2016 the us central bank raised them also once in 2017 three times and in 2018 four times as one can see in the chart below chart 2 effective federal funds rate daily in from january 2014 to december 2018 according to the latest dot plot we will see two hikes in 2019 and one in 2020 it means that the peak is behind the fed as investors are forward looking they will look ahead and see less hawkish fed and some of them could even expect upcoming recession and thus the us central bank slashing rates which should help gold moreover in 2019 the ecb should start raising its policy interest rates the european normalization will be very gradual as the eurozone is more fragile than the usa however the ecb will starts its tightening when the fed runs out of steam that coincidence may support the euro against the greenback gold in terms of the usd should benefit from this turn of events at the same time us fiscal stimulus will start to diminish this year before fading out in 2020 trump s tax cuts became effective in january 2018 so their positive impact will simply ease off especially that some taxpayers will be actually hit by the new tax bill of course trump may strike a deal with democrats about greater federal expenditures on infrastructure but their impact would appear only with delay in 2020 2021 at the earliest to sum up the positive impact of the tax cuts passed in late 2017 will fade just when the financial conditions tighten although the fed will become more dovish the us policy mix will become more restrictive this is why many analysts fear that recession will hit the economy in the near future we are less pessimistic but slowdown is certainly possible the slower pace of economic growth combined with fewer fed interest rate hikes and the first ecb s hike should create macroeconomic environment more friendly for gold than in 2018 hence we should see better price performance next year to be clear we are not saying that bullion will start to rally what we are saying is that fundamental factors should become less friendly toward us dollar and more friendly toward gold however as yogi berra once said it s tough to make predictions especially about the future you see economic systems like biological or climatic systems are extremely sensitive to initial conditions which could be very volatile but markets are even more challenging for forecasting as they are driven by us people with all their complexities emotions and psychology rainy clouds do not feel fear and do not form expectations but we people do and this is extremely difficult to forecast hence keep in mind that even if our appraisal of fundamental trends turns out to be correct the price of gold may deviate due to psychological and trading factors gold might also plunge first based on technicals and then soar back up helped by the improving fundamentals therefore we just painted for you our baseline fundamental forecast for 2019 but a lot may happen on the way then of course we will adjust our view and inform you promptly stay tuned thank you if you enjoyed the above analysis and would you like to know more about the gold

the usd cad remained capped in a tight range of 100 pips at 1 3220 1 3320 as oil price correction higher stopped canada s december inflation accelerated unexpectedly to 2 0 over the year with core inflation measure up 1 7 at the same time only minor economic data are scheduled for both canada and the us with the technical picture favoring continuation of a sideways trend fxstreet forecast poll turned stable with the forecast price for usd cad moving within 160 pips range for 3 months ahead the usd cad remained trapped in a very tight range of about 100 pips ranging from 1 3220 to 1 3320 during the consolidation phase of the third week of january the usd cad is moving within a sideways trend after a flash crash from the beginning of 2019 that saw the pair rising to 1 4134 with the oil prices also remaining in a tight range of one us dollar the commodity market did not provide a reason for the canadian dollar to be boosted it was the release of canada s inflation in december that boosted cad on friday with the headline inflation surprisingly jumping back to 2 bank of canada s targeted level the upward price pressure to transportation and travel related components overshadowed the oil price drop in december that saw gasoline prices fall this is adding a reason for the bank of canada to act on rates as the bank indicated in january that despite the drop in oil prices and inflation it is still firmly on track to monetary policy tightening towards the neutral level of 2 5 3 5 inflation is projected to edge further down and be below 2 through much of 2019 owing mainly to lower gasoline prices the bank of canada wrote in its last monetary policy decision on january 9 on the other hand the bank of canada is expecting depreciation of the canadian dollar to have pro inflationary impulse largely negating the oil price development lower level of the canadian dollar will exert some upward pressure on inflation as these transitory effects unwind and excess capacity is absorbed inflation will return to around the 2 target by late 2019 the bank of canada further stated canada s inflation source statistics canada on the other side of the atlantic the economic calendar is paralyzed by the us government shutdown with only bureau of labor actively releasing the macro data but nothing important came out to influence the markets much the set of the us federal reserve officials was speaking out last week with the patience in relation to the rate hiking outlook becoming the unisono language the upcoming week will see canada s retail sales expectedly dropping by 0 5 over the month in november the upcoming week is set to remain driven by the further direction of oil prices and the monetary policy comments especially from the federal reserve officials although there is no important speech scheduled the technical picture indicates continuous sideways trend framed by a 50 day moving average of 1 3200 and a 100 day moving average of 1 3370 with the technical oscillators depressed in the oversold territory technical analysis usd cad daily chart technically the usd cad is moving within a sideways trend after slumping from the flash crash high of 1 4134 the usd cad is facing support at 1 3200 representing a confluence of a 50 day moving average on a daily chart and a 50 fibonacci retracement of the upmove from last year s low of 1 2260 to 1 4134

with the technical oscillators depressed in the oversold territory statements from fed officials in the week from january 14 18 chicago federal reserve president charles evans said for the bloomberg tv on january 17 fed is at a good point for pausing in raising interest rates it is entirely plausible that the fed could raise rates two times this year could be less tariff and trade issues do not have a great impact on the economic outlook federal reserve vice chairman randal quarles said on january 17 real us economic data are very strong us job creation in december was very big number inflation is very well contained especially with oil prices falling the financial markets recently reacting to doubt about the strength of global growth including china and europe markets now more attuned to downside risks but core base case scenario for the us economy is still very strong i am seeing some stretched valuations in equities commercial real estate but overall risk to us financial stability remains moderate dallas federal reserve president robert kaplan said on january 15 patience on interest rates should last at least a quarter or two and should be a matter of months not weeks a call for patience does not necessarily mean the fed should stop raising rates altogether we are not ready to conclude yet that balance sheet policy needs any changes there is no textbook on fed balance sheet rundown it must be open to learning and ready to make adjustments if data like market liquidity point to a problem kansas city federal reserve bank president esther george and a voting member of the fomc said on january 15 it might be a good time to pause on rate hikes fed should proceed with caution and be patient on rate hikes rates are not yet at neutral though close pause in normalization would give time to assess the effect of rate hikes so far it is unclear whether and how much the fed s balance sheet trim is removing accommodation if inflation pressures emerge more rate hikes could be needed fed rate setting panel will be focused on data when it meets in two weeks fed needs to continually reassess how its balance sheet is affecting the economy the minneapolis federal reserve president and a well known monetary policy dow neel kashkari said on january 15 that he has not seen post tax reform repatriated cash delivering a boost to business investment the federal reserve vice chairman richard clarida said while talking to fox business on january 14 it is not the case that fed policy is a headwind for us economy the us economy has good momentum the fed can be very patient this year december rate hike was the right decision federal open market committee will take policy decisions meeting by meeting as it sees that some global data has been softening the slowdown in global outlook is not yet severe but would tend to impact the us exports i won t hesitate to adjust asset portfolio runoff if needed i don t see a recession on the horizon week ahead

more than a decade after the last global financial crisis hit the next wave of defaults is lapping at our shores financing conditions will become more difficult in 2019 the world s major central banks normalised their monetary policies last year meaning that the times of cheap and abundant credit are over both public and private actors that borrowed heavily in recent years are finding it increasingly hard and costly to refinance their sky high debt stocks the number of countries at high risk of debt distress is increasing in this overview of 2019 we look at the key crises that are threatening economies around the globe and which countries are likely to be hit hardest an end to quantitative easing in europe the european central bank central bank the establishment which in a given state is in charge of issuing bank notes and controlling the volume of currency and credit in france it is the banque de france which assumes this role under the auspices of the european central bank see ecb while in the uk it is the bank of england ecb ecb ecb european central bank the european central bank is a european institution based in frankfurt founded in 1998 to which the countries of the eurozone have transferred their monetary powers its official role is to ensure price stability by combating inflation within that zone its three decision making organs the executive board the governing council and the general council are composed of governors of the central banks of the member states and or recognized specialists according to its statutes it is politically independent but it is directly influenced by the world of finance terminated its net asset purchase programmes in december through these programmes the ecb had helped eurozone countries to issue and refinance debts at low interest rates interest rates when a lends money to b b repays the amount lent by a the capital as well as a supplementary sum known as interest so that a has an interest in agreeing to this financial operation the interest is determined by the interest rate which may be high or low to take a very simple example if a borrows 100 million dollars for 10 years at a fixed interest rate of 5 the first year he will repay a tenth of the capital initially borrowed 10 million dollars plus 5 of the capital owed i e 5 million dollars that is a total of 15 million dollars in the second year he will again repay 10 of the capital borrowed but the 5 now only applies to the remaining 90 million dollars still due i e 4 5 million dollars or a total of 14 5 million dollars and so on until the tenth year when he will repay the last 10 million dollars plus 5 of that remaining 10 million dollars i e 0 5 million dollars giving a total of 10 5 million dollars over 10 years the total amount repaid will come to 127 5 million dollars the repayment of the capital is not usually made in equal instalments in the initial years the repayment concerns mainly the interest and the proportion of capital repaid increases over the years in this case if repayments are stopped the capital still due is higher the nominal interest rate is the rate at which the loan is contracted the real interest rate is the nominal rate reduced by the rate of inflation since 2015 as a result the ecb became the largest creditor in the eu holding more than 2 trillion in government bonds despite the ecb s announced it would keep interest interest an amount paid in remuneration of an investment or received by a lender interest is calculated on the amount of the capital invested or borrowed the duration of the operation and the rate that has been set rates low at zero per cent the end of net asset asset something belonging to an individual or a business that has value or the power to earn money ft the opposite of assets are liabilities that is the part of the balance sheet reflecting a company s resources the capital contributed by the partners provisions for contingencies and charges as well as the outstanding debts purchases marks the end of quantitative easing in europe this policy shift comes at an awkward time as gross domestic product gdp gross domestic product gross domestic product is an aggregate measure of total production within a given territory equal to the sum of the gross values added the measure is notoriously incomplete for example it does not take into account any activity that does not enter into a commercial exchange the gdp takes into account both the production of goods and the production of services economic growth is defined as the variation of the gdp from one period to another gdp growth in the eu dropped dramatically to just 0 3 per cent in the penultimate quarter of 2018 major economies like italy and even germany showed negative growth moreover shocks through a hard brexit trump style trade wars a waning china boom and other factors are likely to hit europe hard in 2019 the shift in ecb policy has implications for financing conditions outside europe too as the liquidity liquidity the facility with which a financial instrument can be bought or sold without a significant change in price created by the ecb s quantitative easing programmes had also made borrowing elsewhere easier and cheaper cost of dollar debt rising the usa is several steps ahead when it comes to ending quantitative easing the us federal reserve bank fed raised interest rates in december to 2 5 per cent the ninth such move since late 2015 dollar debt has thus become expensive which is particularly problematic for public and private debtors in developing countries that took out dollar denominated loans when they were still cheap and easy to find this is no longer the case and according to the fed fed federal reserve officially federal reserve system is the united states central bank created in 1913 by the federal reserve act also called the owen glass act after a series of banking crises particularly the bank panic of 1907 fed decentralized central bank s announcements 2019 will see at least two more interest rate hikes jubilee debt campaign uk recently found that yields on low and lower middle income government debt government debt the total outstanding debt of the state local authorities publicly owned companies and organs of social security increased by an average of 2 2 percentage points over the course of 2018 reaching a staggering annualised rate of 8 per cent by the turn of the year 2019 will likely see several developing countries default or if they don t amassing higher debt servicing costs that represent a massive diversion of scarce public resources for the benefit of creditors and to the detriment of development spending and public service provision global debt has reached record highs and is growing further when the last global financial crisis hit the total debt of advanced economies had reached only 233 per cent of gdp by the end of 2017 this figure was 269 per cent even more drastic was the increase in emerging economies where total debt surged from 113 per cent in 2007 to 176 per cent of gdp in 2017 according to data from the bank for international settlements particularly worrying is the drastic rise of corporate debt in both rich and not so rich countries but particularly in china countries to watch while the risk of crises is generally increasing some countries face particular challenges according to the imf imf international monetary fund along with the world bank the imf was founded on the day the bretton woods agreements were signed its first mission was to support the new system of standard exchange rates when the bretton wood fixed rates system came to an end in 1971 the main function of the imf became that of being both policeman and fireman for global capital it acts as policeman when it enforces its structural adjustment policies and as fireman when it steps in to help out governments in risk of defaulting on debt repayments as for the world bank a weighted voting system operates depending on the amount paid as contribution by each member state 85 of the votes is required to modify the imf charter which means that the usa with 17 68 of the votes has a de facto veto on any change the institution is dominated by five countries the united states 16 74 japan 6 23 germany 5 81 france 4 29 and the uk 4 29 the other 183 member countries

sierra leone the troubles in argentina pakistan and turkey were the first signs of the upcoming emerging markets crisis caused by overlending of private or official lenders here are some more countries to watch in 2019 with so many crises ongoing and more expected to emerge it is no surprise that the topic is high up the agenda of international organisations for 2019 the global policy making calendar offers a number of opportunities to take bold steps that could turn the tide and stop these potential crises from escalating any further read our next blog to find out more about key

selections within brazil were the primary drivers of returns during the month and performance remained resilient supported by stable economic activity consumption oriented names such as payment name linx and retailers renner and b2w performed well with b2w demonstrating its ability to maintain sales growth a lack of positioning in beverage company ambev was the largest individual contributor in december on the other hand our holdings in mexico weighed on performance in aggregate energy related names petrobras and ultrapar were among the worst performers falling alongside declines in the oil price similarly vale and steel producer gerdau detracted from performance on commodity price weakness during the month we trimmed some brazilian exposure following strong relative performance in the region on the other hand we added to mexico as the market remained weak on what we believed to be overly negative sentiment this positioning was rewarded on the back of a responsible budget proposal for 2019 broadly we have been active in taking profits across our positions and redeploying capital on market dips more recently we have also trimmed exposure across the resource sectors the portfolio ended the period being overweight brazil while being underweight chile peru and colombia and maintaining a relatively neutral stance on mexico we continue to maintain an off benchmark allocation to argentina through software exporter globant at the sector level we are overweight the domestic consumer while being underweight staples and utilities brazil remains our largest overweight given our positive expectations for the incoming administration so far president elect jair bolsonaro has delivered on his campaign promises looking to reduce the size of the government by initially reducing the number of ministries naming sector subject experts to lead cabinets and pointing to a continuation of the reform process initiated two years ago meanwhile the outlook for upcoming corporate results point to a continuation in the economic recovery providing strong momentum for growth into 2019 elsewhere the cancellation of naim new mexico international airport reminded markets of the concerns regarding increasing populism for the incoming administration in mexico reinforcing our cautious view on mexican equities we remain underweight the andean region due to a combination of unattractive valuation and disappointing growth finally the dramatic sell off in argentina in 2018 leaves the stocks trading at attractive valuations while interest rates and the currency have mostly stabilized providing a foundation for the economy to rebound from recent downturn sources 1blackrock as at 31 december 2018 2datastream as at 31 december 2018 18 january 2019 ends latest information

spread this news by panashe chigumadzi after replacing robert mugabe as the president of zimbabwe in late 2017 emmerson mnangagwa promised a new zimbabwe a country with a thriving and open economy jobs for its youth opportunities for investors and democracy and equal rights for all but those hopes have died as mr mnangagwa has turned out to be no different from the strongman he served for decades and eventually deposed on sunday mnangagwa announced a more than 150 percent increase in the fuel price in response the zimbabwean congress of trade unions and the prominent civil society leader pastor evan mawarire called for a three day strike starting monday against the increasing fuel price and worsening economic conditions in a broad crackdown the government blocked the internet and with it social media it deployed the military and the police in urban centres and residential areas of harare and bulawayo the two major cities where they opened fire on protesters at least eight people were killed 68 were shot and 100 cases of assaults with sharp objects booted feet baton sticks were reported as the strike continued on wednesday confidence in mnangagwa s government has fallen over the past several months as the economy has steadily slid toward a crisis zimbabwe has been facing a currency shortage which has led to devaluation of salaries doctors have only recently returned to work after a six week strike over salaries and working conditions and their demands have not been met civil servants who number 300 000 and earn between 280 and 300 per month recently threatened to strike demanding higher salaries and to have a portion of their salaries paid in dollars major businesses are halting operations and in some cases shutting down this harsh reality became personal on friday as i read a message from an uncle on a family whatsapp group he had worked for years for olivine industries one of zimbabwe s oldest companies and the leading manufacturer of cooking oil soap and margarine my uncle s employer shut down its operations citing a crippling 11 million debt and sent its employees on indefinite leave zimbabweans particularly the urban poor who have been most affected by the state violence following the strike are very angry with mnangagwa s management of the economy after 37 years of mugabe s rule the new zimbabwean president did inherit an economy debilitated by huge government debts a serious currency shortage widespread unemployment and broken infrastructure mnangagwa responded with the slogan zimbabwe is open for business in september he appointed mthuli ncube a respected economist who has taught at the university of cambridge and served as the vice president and chief economist of the african development bank as his finance minister in november ncube presented the new austerity for prosperity fiscal policy which included the continued use of the bond note the country s surrogate currency new import duties to be paid in dollars for an array of goods including vehicles despite highly inefficient public transport and a new tax on electronic transactions which now form the bulk of exchanges in the severely strapped economy these measures increased the burden on consumers already buckling under some of the highest inflation rates in a decade ncube also proposed reducing the number of civil servants and privatisation of loss making parastatals which reminded many zimbabweans of the disastrous economic structural adjustment program of the 1990s it led to a 25 percent reduction in the civil service withdrawal of subsidies commercialisation and privatisation of several state owned companies and introduction of user fees in the health and education sectors among other measures then as now there was much corruption in government spending and the combination of structural adjustment and economic bungling such as the payment of around 300 million in unbudgeted compensation to war veterans in 1997 resulted in price increases currency devaluation and job losses followed by protests led by organised labor and civil society
by reuters by cassandra garrison and gabriel burin buenos aires reuters argentina s central bank bought 190 million 147 1 million in foreign exchange markets over the past week to weaken its peso currency a radical change from just months ago when it was spending billions to prop it up and may be forced to intervene further after a run on the peso last year halved its value the central bank introduced a super tight monetary policy that boosted the currency but over the past week the strengthening currency has slipped outside the limits of a non intervention band agreed with the international monetary fund in part the improvement in the peso s fortunes has been due to dwindling expectations that the federal reserves will raise u s interest rates rising u s treasury yields last year drained money from emerging markets hurting the peso in addition the tighter monetary policy introduced last year to stabilise the peso has left many small and medium sized argentine companies without access to pesos president mauricio macri s government froze growth in the money supply last year as part of the 56 3 billion imf agreement as a result many companies in argentina have been forced to sell dollars in recent weeks to make payments in local currency to pay suppliers salaries and taxes the combination of domestic and international factors pushed the peso to strengthen past the limit of its band for the first time on jan 10 prompting the central bank to intervene for five days in a row over the past week on thursday the bank remained on the sidelines of the market after several days of intervention as the peso fell 0 56 percent to 37 7 per u s dollar pushing it back inside the band the moving band stood at 37 523 pesos to the dollar to 48 559 on thursday yet some economists suggested the bank may be forced to resume its dollar buying in the coming days purchases of dollars could continue as pressures on the exchange rate increase because companies and families have to sell dollars to get pesos said martin vauthier director of consultancy eco go while the slump in the peso last year sowed economic chaos the strengthening in the currency isn t necessarily a good thing economists say the weaker peso helped to make argentina s products more competitive overseas raising hopes that a rebound in exports could fuel growth after a painful recession argentina needs a weaker peso further peso appreciation could halt the external adjustment that argentina needs to rebalance and narrow its current account deficit said edward glossop who covers emerging markets at capital economics in london maintaining the band for carlos de sousa a senior economist at oxford economics argentina s sky high interest rates need to fall to prevent the peso from strengthening above the upper limit of its band in the medium term as the central bank has pledged not to buy more than 50 million a day to stabilise it the central bank of argentina has made too many promises you are promising that you are not going to allow the monetary base to grow and that you are not going to intervene more than 50 million a day and not more than 2 percent of your monetary base per month that is a really big set of promises de sousa said however with elections looming in october in which business friendly president mauricio macri faces a tough battle to win a second term the peso could also come under selling pressure as political uncertainty mounts economists said if the peso strays outside the band for weeks on end it would raise questions over whether the bank should drop the policy said ilya gofshteyn of standard chartered in new york advertisement it s almost a self fulfilling prophecy the more speculation heats up the more capital inflows you get and therefore the more pressure on the bank there is to let the band go all together gofshteyn said other economists took a cautious view that the band will remain in place but could flatten as the peso stabilizes over time you hope it becomes a freely floating exchange rate but there is a case for waiting until after the election before you make the next step said dirk willer an emerging market analyst at citigroup reporting by gabriel burin and cassandra garrison editing by ross colvin and phil berlowitz
published friday 18 january 2019 print disqus will 2019 be better than 2018 for the yellow metal we invite you to read our today s article painting the macroeconomic outlook for 2018 and learn whether fundamental factors will become less or more friendly toward gold what will 2019 be like we do not know the precise answer but we notice a few important economic trends that will shape the new year 1 interest rates will continue to rise 2 however the fed s monetary tightening will slow down 3 just when the ecb will start normalizing its own monetary policy 4 and when the stimulus of the us fiscal policy will start to dissipate we will analyze them now for you as we believe that investors need a clear guide to navigate themselves through choppy waters of our volatile economy without a broader fundamental perspective it s easy to get lost in the thicket of daily news as we predicted the long term interest rates climbed in 2018 see the chart below we expect them to rise further this year this is because the fed will continue its tightening cycle even if it pauses for a while higher short term rates should translate into higher real long term rates chart 1 us nominal green line and real red line interest rates from january 2014 to december 2018 moreover the us fiscal deficit will exert upward pressure on the interest rates as treasury will have to compete for limited funds and with stronger inflationary pressure in 2018 than in the last few years people may demand higher inflation premium pushing the interest rates further this trend will exert downward pressure on the gold prices as higher rates mean a raise in opportunity costs of holding gold they also support the us dollar the greatest enemy of the yellow metal at the same time we do not expect that inflation will get out of control so the demand for gold as an inflation hedge should remain in dormancy however the fed s monetary tightening will slow down the fed started moving away from zirp in 2015 hiking its interests rates in december by 0 25 basis points in 2016 the us central bank raised them also once in 2017 three times and in 2018 four times as one can see in the chart below chart 2 effective federal funds rate daily in from january 2014 to december 2018 according to the latest dot plot we will see two hikes in 2019 and one in 2020 it means that the peak is behind the fed as investors are forward looking they will look ahead and see less hawkish fed and some of them could even expect upcoming recession and thus the us central bank slashing rates which should help gold moreover in 2019 the ecb should start raising its policy interest rates the european normalization will be very gradual as the eurozone is more fragile than the usa however the ecb will starts its tightening when the fed runs out of steam that coincidence may support the euro against the greenback gold in terms of the usd should benefit from this turn of events at the same time us fiscal stimulus will start to diminish this year before fading out in 2020 trump s tax cuts became effective in january 2018 so their positive impact will simply ease off especially that some taxpayers will be actually hit by the new tax bill of course trump may strike a deal with democrats about greater federal expenditures on infrastructure but their impact would appear only with delay in 2020 2021 at the earliest to sum up the positive impact of the tax cuts passed in late 2017 will fade just when the financial conditions tighten although the fed will become more dovish the us policy mix will become more restrictive this is why many analysts fear that recession will hit the economy in the near future we are less pessimistic but slowdown is certainly possible the slower pace of economic growth combined with fewer fed interest rate hikes and the first ecb s hike should create macroeconomic environment more friendly for gold than in 2018 hence we should see better price performance next year to be clear we are not saying that bullion will start to rally what we are saying is that fundamental factors should become less friendly toward us dollar and more friendly toward gold however as yogi berra once said it s tough to make predictions especially about the future you see economic systems like biological or climatic systems are extremely sensitive to initial conditions which could be very volatile but markets are even more challenging for forecasting as they are driven by us people with all their complexities emotions and psychology rainy clouds do not feel fear and do not form expectations but we people do and this is extremely difficult to forecast hence keep in mind that even if our appraisal of fundamental trends turns out to be correct the price of gold may deviate due to psychological and trading factors gold might also plunge first based on technicals and then soar back up helped by the improving fundamentals therefore we just painted for you our baseline fundamental forecast for 2019 but a lot may happen on the way then of course we will adjust our view and inform you promptly stay tuned thank you arkadiusz sieron sunshine profits gold news monitor and market overview editor all

khartoum sudan must implement radical reforms or seek a bailout from friendly nations to pull its economy out of the current downward spiral economists and bankers say the government has run up budget deficits by subsidising the cost of fuel bread and other products to cover this deficit it has expanded the money supply but that has served to debase the currency causing inflation to soar and the value of the sudanese pound against other currencies to plummet in turn pushing up the cost of subsidies and widening the deficit even further attempts to raise bread and fuel prices to reduce the cost of subsidies sparked protests that will soon enter their second month the riots right now all that s going on it s just a reflection of the accumulation of the poverty and salaries being where they are and prices that keep going up said one sudanese banker who asked not to be named the government announced an emergency 15 month austerity programme in october but it still offers deep subsidies on basic goods petrol is cheaper in sudan than almost anywhere else in the world the government sets the price at 6 17 sudanese pounds per litre just under 13 us cents 47 fils at the official exchange rate or about 10 6 cents at the black market rate diesel sells for 4 25 sudanese pounds per litre for bread the government pays private traders a 680 sudanese pound subsidy for each 150kg sack of flour they import one sack normally costs about 1 230 pounds one banker said the government then sets the retail price of bread at one pound per 40 grammes the last time it raised the price was in january 2018 increasing a loaf from only half a pound bankers said a move that triggered a more limited round of protests the effect of subsidies on the deficit is hard to assess clearly however since the finance ministry has yet to post the 2018 or 2019 budgets on its website much of the cost has been hidden or borne by the central bank according to imf reports central bank statistics show that m1 money supply growth rose from as low as an annual 14 3 per cent in april 2016 to 88 3 per cent in april 2018 before slipping back to 76 per cent in august with a shortage of cash banknotes much of the increased money supply was electronic or via cheques printing press bust this is partly because the country s sole banknote printing press broke down in early 2018 forcing the central bank to order new banknotes from abroad three khartoum bankers said customers queue for hours at banks and cash machines public scandals at two separate banks compounded the problem causing a small run on banks in the second half of 2018 one banker said high inflation has led customers to empty their accounts and invest elsewhere another banker said inflation soared to nearly 70 per cent in november official figures show steve hanke an expert in distressed currencies at johns hopkins university estimated the actual annual inflation rate as of january 15 at 91 per cent based on the black market exchange rate and purchasing power parity that works out at a month on month rate far below the 50 per cent that defines hyperinflation but it is still worryingly high with only venezuela zimbabwe iran and argentina suffering steeper price rises said hanke they re having trouble reducing the subsidies and they can t go to the international bond market to get money hanke told reuters so they basically turn on the printing presses normally countries in such dire straits would turn to the imf for support as they implement the painful steps it demands to straighten out their finances but washington lists sudan as a supporter of terrorism and has promised to veto any request for imf assistance until it complies with a series of political humanitarian and security demands

tax them all and let the irs sort it out photo dirck halstead the life images collection getty images two weeks ago 60 minutes put alexandria ocasio cortez on national television and the congresswoman put soaking the rich back into our national political conversation and conservatives have been trying to put the cat back in the bag ever since the right s first instinct was to shut the overton window on the congresswoman s fingers the libertarian economist tyler cowen dubbed her push for a 70 percent top marginal tax rate the trump reelection campaign but the idea that trump would relish the chance to campaign against tax hikes on the rich never made much sense not least because through much of 2016 he campaigned in support of them and polling on aoc s idea quickly affirmed the broad popularity of imposing confiscatory tax rates on multimillionaires political concern trolling soon gave way to the substantive variety conservatives observed that while ocasio cortez s proposal targeted high salaries the superrich s income derives primarily from capital gains and anyhow if you raise rich people s taxes all you ll really do is divert more capital into offshore tax havens these arguments might have been compelling had ocasio cortez s proposal been a written bill rather than an extemporaneous illustration of her general philosophy on tax policy in reality the congresswoman and her ideological allies are quite enthusiastic about raising taxes on capital gains and cracking down on tax havens the real debate here isn t about how to most effectively soak the rich it s about whether the rich should be effectively soaked in recent days the right s finest minds have coughed up some arguments for why they shouldn t be the strongest of these rest on tendentious economic premises the weakest on fallacious ones meanwhile none of the right s contentions account for the possibility that extreme inequality is politically undesirable and would remain so even if it was economically beneficent to appreciate how poor the conservative case is against soaking the rich let s examine five of their arguments in turn one if we heavily tax millionaires no one will want to go to college here s how michael strain director of economic policy at the american enterprise institute phrased this point in bloomberg f the government will take 70 cents of every dollar you earn above a certain income threshold why go to college the threshold obviously matters of course but the basic point about the decision to acquire advanced skills remains a 70 percent top rate could negatively affect the careers people choose a young person interested in health care might decide to become a nurse rather than a surgeon because much of the income gained from being a surgeon will be taken by the government there is not much empirical evidence on how important these longer term considerations are because sorting through the drivers of educational and occupational choice is very difficult but just because economists can t assign a magnitude to these effects does not mean that real world tax policy should assume they aren t important the trouble with this argument as strain euphemistically concedes is that it has no evidentiary basis as matt bruenig of the people s policy project notes sweden effectively has a 70 percent tax rate on labor income and that rate kicks in at roughly 98 000 if strain is correct that imposing a 70 percent tax on eight figure incomes or even high six figure ones would depress educational attainment and leave america bereft of surgeons then surely these effects would be visible in a nation that has long taxed high five figure incomes at a similar rate but they aren t as of 2013 43 percent of swedes between the ages of 25 and 54 were college graduates among americans of that cohort the rate of college attainment was exactly the same according to data compiled by the oecd and visualized below by the russell sage foundation meanwhile high tax norway boasted a higher rate of tertiary education than the united states did one wonders if strain s objective is to maximize college attainment wouldn t supporting tuition free college be a better expedient than opposing tax hikes on the one percent it is true that sweden has fewer doctors than it would like but that is also true of the united states and anyhow the former nation s high tax rates haven t prevented its health care system from routinely outperforming america s on virtually every metric two soaking the rich will reduce innovation which will itself hurt the poor this argument comes courtesy of the aforementioned george mason university economist tyler cowen he focus should be on designing a 21st century tax system that can jump start innovation in the u s once again surely that is not going to require confiscatory rates for some of the most creative americans let s table cowen s normative argument that when evaluating the tax code our objective should be to maximize innovation not progressivity we ll get to that later first let s ask do we actually know that soaking the rich reduces innovation the short answer is no in fact there are sound reasons to suspect that high top tax rates do not depress productivity and may even increase it one implicit assumption of cowen s argument is that there is a reasonably tight correlation between a worker s market income and the social utility of her labor this premise appears dubious when applied generally and outright absurd when applied to america s highest earners the financial sector offers the highest wages of any industry in the united states it is also much too large for our economy s own good according to research from the oecd and imf thus if we assume that america s most innovative minds are motivated primarily by avarice as cowen does then keeping top marginal tax rates low is actually directing precious human capital into a sector we need to shrink which does america need more of exceptionally creative high school teachers and environmental engineers or exceptionally creative high frequency traders and white shoe lawyers would we rather have innovations that help children learn better or ones that infinitesimally increase the speed at which hedge funds can make financial transactions if we d prefer the former then wouldn t reducing the wage differential between teachers and hedge fund quants by heavily taxing the latter s high incomes increase desirable forms of innovation by more rationally allocating human capital research from the economists benjamin lockwood charles nathanson and glen weyl suggests that high top marginal tax rates can produce small gains in welfare by promoting a more optimal allocation of talented individuals between professions though profession specific taxes and subsidies were far more effective in achieving such ends cowen might quibble with these findings but he has no dispositive empirical evidence confirming that high marginal tax rates reliably depress innovation by contrast those pesky nordic social democracies have produced significant empirical evidence disputing cowen s for example high tax sweden has fostered so much high tech innovation the financial times dubbed stockholm the unicorn factory in 2015 in the past decade this city of 800 000 inhabitants has churned out more billion dollar tech companies than any in europe beating metropolises such as london and berlin according to a study by atomico on a per capita basis stockholm is the second most prolific tech hub globally with 6 3 billion dollar companies per million people compared to silicon valley with 6 9 meanwhile as bruenig has documented the nordic countries have seen much higher growth in gdp per hour worked a k a productivity since 1970 than the u s has it is true that america produces far more patents per capita than scandinavia does but that probably says more about the flaws in our patent laws than it does about those in sweden s economy after all there has been no correlation between patent production and productivity growth in the united states according to data from the congressional budget office three if you heavily tax high incomes you will actually solidify the existing aristocracy s economic supremacy for a more interesting bad argument against soaking the rich let s turn to the niskanen center s samuel hammond sweden s strict egalitarian commitment to income equality comes at a cost levels of wealth inequality that remain notably higher than in the united states the reason goes back to high marginal tax rates as a hereditary monarchy sweden still has a formal nobility with protected titles and dynastic wealth while high marginal taxes soaked the top 0 1 percent they have essentially crystallized the nobility s privileged position by making it hard for outsiders to displace them by accumulating wealth from scratch there s a valid point here introducing steep taxes on income while leaving wealth alone does strengthen the existing aristocracy s grip on the top rung of the economic ladder nevertheless this fails as an argument against the progressive vision for taxation for two reasons first ocasio cortez and her allies are quite comfortable with increasing taxes on inheritances and other forms of concentrated wealth second while sweden s high marginal taxes have preserved wealth inequality among private citizens they have succeeded in closing the gap between the collective wealth of the swedish people and that of the swedish superrich generally speaking progressives do not dislike concentrated wealth because it makes it harder for creative destruction to replace the old rentier class with a fresher faced version rather they oppose such wealth because it gives unaccountable private individuals too much power over society as a whole more on that point in a minute and as the people s policy project illustrates below sweden s tax policies have been very effective at shifting the balance of economic power away from the formal nobility and toward the demos by the end of the social democratic party s era of dominance more than 40 percent of national wealth was owned by a democratic government which used said wealth to provide the swedish working class with a historically unprecedented degree of social insurance and economic security four many superrich people earned their wealth the dream hoarders of the upper middle class are the real parasites here is hammond s other main argument against confiscatory taxes on high earners the focus on the super rich is a red herring to the extent that the american economy is genuinely and unfairly captured be it through special tax advantages zoning restrictions or elite education tracks the blame lies with what richard reeves of the brookings institution calls dream hoarders some dream hoarders are in the top 0 1 to be sure but their ranks extend throughout the upper middle class ow wealth is created and transferred matters much more than whether some individuals happen to have more than others liberal theories of distributive justice thus focus on what philosophers call the cooperative surplus of a society redistributing the private benefits of wealth creation in order to keep the social system positive sum and thus secure cooperation across its members wealth acquired through real estate appreciation for example is treated much differently than wealth acquired through productive entrepreneurship both because such wealth represents a form of zero sum rent seeking and because it can easily lead to the creation of status divisions in society that are difficult to disrupt if hammond s contention were that a truly egalitarian economic agenda must include the abolition of exclusionary zoning the equalization of public school funding so that the value of your property doesn t determine the quality of your child s education and the repeal of upper middle class tax breaks then it would be unobjectionable but his argument isn t that confiscatory taxes on the superrich are insufficient it s that they re undesirable and the reason they re undesirable is that the superrich haven t unfairly captured our economy only the disproportionately upper middle class dream hoarders have it is difficult to comprehend how anyone concerned by rent seeking let alone the creation of status divisions in society would see the top 0 1 percent as a red herring after all that red herring increased its share of economic growth by orders of magnitude more than the upper middle class did over the past four decades a period that saw relatively tepid growth in our nation s overall productivity these figures alone should be enough to establish that the superrich are raking in more value than they could possibly be producing meanwhile the top 0 1 percent now lay claim to 90 percent of all of america s wealth can anyone honestly argue that wealth monopolization of that magnitude is not likely to create durable status divisions in society no nytdavidbrooks tremendous gains are not going to the top 20 they are going to top 1 key to understand gop pic twitter com dkc38x8f6s gabriel zucman gabriel_zucman june 27 2017 perhaps hammond s contention is that the superrich typically invest their wealth in productive enterprises while the upper middle class primarily speculate on real estate that might be true in relative terms but it s patently false in absolute ones the superrich invest an enormous amount of wealth in bidding up the price of luxury properties as of november tiger 21 an investment club for speculators with at least 10 million to invest had nearly 30 percent of its holdings in real estate hammond s one explicit argument for why the merely affluent are the real rentiers is that they have more votes than the superrich and thus can extract more favors from the state but this naïvely presumes that policy is shaped primarily at the ballot box in reality a great deal of public policy is made without the electorate s notice ordinary voters even upper middle class ones do not have time to monitor the fine print in every congressional funding bill or trade agreement or piece of regulatory guidance but the 0 1 percent s lobbyists do a moment s glance at america s existing tax code which taxes a doctor s labor income much more heavily than billionaire investors capital gains and polling on the american public s views on tax policy which shows overwhelming support for raising taxes on the über wealthy should be enough to establish that the superrich enjoy at least as much undue influence over the state as the merely affluent do and that conclusion is further affirmed by the sheer difficulty of effectively taxing the 0 1 percent at all the upper middle class isn t responsible for america s failure to make combating tax evasion one of its top goals in international diplomacy the superrich titans of american industry are five extreme inequality is fine so long as it s compatible with economic growth and poverty reduction hammond makes this point explicitly but the idea that extreme economic inequality isn t a problem in itself is implicit in every conservative argument against aggressively taxing the one percent conservative economists take it as a given that there is no inherent value in reducing inequality and thus that if a redistributive policy would reduce the absolute material well being of the median american even marginally then said policy is unjustifiable but for small d democrats this truth is far from self evident as indicated above shaping public policy requires investments of time money and attention wealthy individuals and corporations can easily shoulder such expenses ordinary voters can t this simple reality that economic power is easily converted into the political variety is an inherent constraint on popular sovereignty under capitalism but it is a constraint that can be more or less restrictive depending on how unequally wealth is distributed and how politically organized ordinary working people are political science research and american history indicates that in periods of exceptionally high economic inequality american policy making grows exceptionally detached from majoritarian preferences and hostile to labor unions i e the most effective vehicles for mass class based political organization conservative intellectuals often cite individual liberty defined as the freedom of contract and from arbitrary coercion as the guiding principle of their politics but americans will never enjoy such liberty if they cannot meaningfully influence their contractual obligations to the state which is to say the laws that they are coerced into obeying as the great american political scientist robert dahl once wrote one of the most fundamental of all human freedoms is the freedom to help determine in cooperation with others the laws and rules that one must obey america s present level of economic inequality is incompatible with that freedom all of which is to say there is no reason to assume that taxing the wealthy at nordic rates would make america less economically productive and good reason to think that even if it did doing so would enhance our collective liberty
buenos aires like many argentine businessmen marco meloni is doing everything he can to avoid laying off staff at his textile factory despite a slump in sales more than 70 percent interest rates and soaring utility bills the reason he doesn t have the money to fire anyone a little reported and unusual feature of the economic crisis gripping latin america s third largest economy is the absence of many workers losing their jobs small businesses the biggest employer in argentina have been hardest hit by inflation that is nearly 48 percent a tumbling peso and major cuts to subsidies for public utilities that have sharply increased companies operating costs but the unemployment rate has barely budged from 9 percent reuters interviews with business owners in textile plastic clothing and paint industries government officials and union leaders show that many firms are adopting different strategies to try to survive until the economy begins to recover which the international monetary fund expects to begin in the second quarter firms are reducing working hours halting production on some days cutting shifts and making workers take their vacations now in anticipation of more customer demand once the economy lifts the workforce contracted by just 120 000 registered workers between october 2017 and october 2018 the latest government data reviewed by reuters shows that represents about 1 percent of the 12 million strong labor force in contrast the united states lost about 6 percent or some 8 7 million people of its workforce during the two years of the 2007 08 great recession as companies laid off workers to stay afloat argentina has some of the world s most generous labor laws and they are making it more difficult for small business owners like meloni to adapt to an economy now in recession typically in a tough economic climate a company might be expected to reduce its workforce to cut costs but in argentina taking that step could dramatically increase costs and potentially push a company into bankruptcy introduced by successive populist peronist governments since the 1940s the labor laws make the country one of the most expensive in latin america to employ or fire a worker argentine companies are required to pay workers laid off a month for every year of service plus at least one additional month simply for informing them they are being fired and crucially there is no cap on how much a company needs to pay giving notice the argentine labor laws have helped to contain what could have been a big increase in the unemployment rate in addition president mauricio macri a free marketer who wants to reform the country s rigid labor system to encourage foreign investment is taking steps to dissuade companies from firing workers he announced on nov 13 that companies must give 10 days notice of any plans to lay off workers so that the government can help find ways to keep them employed macri wants to expand an existing program that helps to subsidize salaries of workers at companies that can show they are in financial straits like many small businessmen meloni has found himself caught in a vice sales from his plant in the town of quilmes 19 miles outside the capital buenos aires shrank by just over one third last year as argentina s economy sank deep into recession it was not a storm said meloni a reference to how the country s president has described the economic crisis it was a tsunami the tsunami kills meloni said the plant which makes fabrics used to operate 24 hours a day from monday to saturday but now just operates 16 hours a day five days a week like many other businesses meloni advanced the holidays to his roughly 100 employees with the hope that once summer ends in march demand will pick up daniel funes de rioja the head of one of argentina s biggest labor law firms said a major issue for companies was the seniority of many workers many especially in low skilled industries stay in the same job for years so paying them severance becomes very expensive there s a cultural custom for argentines to remain in their jobs but also as it has been always very expensive to fire people that has extended the length of service of the workers in the companies explained economist camilo tiscornia from buenos aires based c t consultancy production minister dante sica said companies were also reluctant to fire workers because of forecasts showing an economic recovery around the corner they prefer to suspend and not fire because of the cost of layoffs plus the cost of hiring is costly sica said in an interview the unemployment rate in argentina fell to 9 percent in the third quarter from 9 6 percent in the second quarter year on year it increased only 0 7 basis points from the third quarter of 2017 when the economy was growing at an annual rate of 3 8 percent while workers are staying in their jobs they are earning less because of the shorter hours and fewer shifts some have resorted to taking second jobs working for uber the ride hailing app for example according to anecdotal reports forced vacations macri has pushed for labor reforms to make it easier for companies to hire and fire but his government has delayed implementing them after protests in december 2017 sica the production minister has said they will try again in 2019 but it will be difficult to get political support for the reforms in an election year tiscornia the economist said the difficulty in firing workers ultimately hurt the competitiveness of argentine companies making it easier to fire people or to reduce salaries improves the economic efficiency and the companies capacity to adjust to different situations he said in the u s it s tremendously easy to fire but at the same time they are at the lowest historic jobless rate because that market has very strong flexibility that favors the creation of new companies here if you start a business and it doesn t work you are stuck with the employees so you don t even try by eliana raszewski
the current tensions between china and america might seem to be mainly about economics president donald trump s tweets complain about an unfair state capitalist model intellectual property theft and restrictions on foreign investment his response too is all about economics a tariff war with demands that bilateral deficits are shrunk and trade deals are revised in the us s favor but behind this rhetoric is the uncomfortable reality that china s gdp will soon match america s however it is measured confounded in trump s economic bluster is the security challenge implied by china s economic heft today beijing may still lag militarily but even from this position it effectively dominates the south china sea

istock marchello74 the dollar s current strength is creating bargains in some of the world s most appealing places to own a home of your own specifically as we head into 2019 property markets are dramatically discounted for dollar buyers in brazil colombia mexico and chile brazil currency brazilian real currency controls yes dollar s increase in value over the real in the past 12 months 16 5 dollar s increase in value over the real since jan 1 2013 90 brazil s history is one of the americas most fascinating stories over the years the country was the new world s great plantation slave society host to its first major gold rush and ruled by the hemisphere s only empire brazil is a big country but most of the viable lifestyle options are along the coast from the big city of rio de janeiro to smaller beach towns like florianopolis i d recommend taking a look at maceió the first europeans to arrive here were dutch settlers who came to brazil to start a sugar plantation to supply the ever increasing demand in europe in the early 1600s the portuguese took control of the area in the 1650s and the city continued to grow maceió soon became a major seaport exporting timber tobacco coconuts leather and spices today maceió is modern clean and elegant with miles of white sand beaches studded with colorful umbrellas and bordered by tall swaying palms its warm turquoise waters gently lap the shores as beachgoers from all over enjoy the sun and sand the town s long stretch of beachfront is the main attraction and it s one of the best you ll find in brazil it s as naturally beautiful as it s possible for a beach to be but without the bothersome vendors beggars and obvious sex trade that you ll find in other better known brazilian beach cities if you re in the market for cheap beachfront property maceió should be near the top of your list you could buy a large three bedroom apartment here for less than 75 000 downsides to brazil include the small english speaking population relative to the 200 million inhabitants other downsides have to do with currency exchange rates and controls you want to be careful about how you bring money into the country or you could have trouble when the time comes to take it and any associated profits out brazil s economy has faltered in recent years so you stand to gain twofold from the recovery of the economy as well as the currency when the recovery comes the economy should help to raise prices in reals while the recovering real should further raise the value of your investment in dollar terms historically americans and canadians have needed a visa to enter brazil as a tourist obtaining this visa was an annoying and time consuming process brazil now offers an evisa that you can obtain online for only 40 plus a service fee of a few dollars also new for 2019 brazil has introduced a new residency option a real estate purchase in this country can now qualify you for permanent residency colombia currency colombian peso currency controls yes dollar s increase in value over the peso in the past 12 months 6 1 dollar s increase in value over the peso since jan 1 2013 81 years ago i sat around a table in a just opened restaurant in a little known mountain town in panama called boquete with a group of investors and businesspeople in the country as i was to scout opportunity i believe that the potential in this place for retirees is enormous one of the gentlemen in the group the one who had just invested in opening the restaurant where we were having dinner theorized right now the opportunity here is for the investor and the speculator property prices are so under valued apartments in panama city are a screaming bargain on a global scale pacific beachfront caribbean farmland river front this country has it all and it s all cheap panama is still misunderstood suffering from a lingering case of bad press my host for the evening continued when you say panama to an american today he thinks noriega drug cartels cia intrigue it won t be too many years before those perceptions are flipped on their head i predict that five seven years from now when you say panama to the average american he ll think retirement because that s what this country is gearing up to offer a very appealing retirement option that was 1999 in august 2010 the aarp named boquete panama one of the top five places in the world to retire a few years ago i sat around a table in a just opened restaurant in a little known mountain town in colombia called medellin with a group of investors and businesspeople in the country as i was to explore current opportunity property values in this city are so under valued one of the gentlemen having dinner with me remarked i believe that apartment costs here are the lowest for any cosmopolitan city in the world on a per square meter basis this is because colombia including medellin is still misunderstood when you say medellin to the average american he thinks drugs gangs pablo escobar it s such a misperception the current reality of this city is so far removed from all that as in panama years ago the opportunity today in medellin is for the investor right now you could buy almost anything in this city and feel comfortable that you could make money from the purchase and this is a market where you could buy in with as little as 50 000 the coming opportunity in medellin is for the retiree i predict that five seven years from now when you say medellin to the average american he ll think retirement this city of springtime and flowers offers a very appealing and competitive retirement option cautions associated with buying in colombia have to do exchange controls and other bureaucratic restrictions also taxes are high on the other hand colombia is one of the easiest places in the world to obtain residency the country offers 17 visa options and requirements are minimal mexico currency mexican peso currency controls no dollar s increase in value over the peso in the past 12 months 5 5 dollar s increase in value over the real since jan 1 2013 58 mexico is a big place with a bad reputation the reputation isn t altogether undeserved as drug cartels do control parts of this country but hardly all of it and some of the most appealing regions for both living and investing sit outside the conflict zones mexico offers two long coasts mountain towns and colonial cities plus mayan ruins jungle rain forest rivers and lakes it s also the most accessible overseas haven from the united states you could drive back and forth if you wanted for all these reasons mexico is home to the biggest established populations of american expats in the world more than 1 million americans live in mexico and more than 500 000 own homes here these expats are enjoying a low cost of living at today s exchange rates while new arrivals are getting great property bargains real estate trades in u s dollars or mexican pesos depending on the region it s the peso priced properties that offer dollar shoppers increased buying power mazatlan on the pacific coast a city with both beautiful beaches and a spanish colonial center is one such market the process of establishing residency in mexico is easier even than in colombia you can obtain your visa from a mexican consulate in the united states in as little as 30 minutes finally the country s accessibility from the united states makes it a top choice if you d like to continue to use medicare to cover your health costs medicare doesn t cover you anywhere outside the united states however living in mexico you could drive back across the border to get your healthcare in the states this can take a big concern off the table many expats living in ensenada for example drive to san diego for their major health care needs chile currency chilean peso currency controls no dollar s increase in value over the peso in the past 12 months 7 8 dollar s increase in value over the peso since jan 1 2013 46 with its modern four lane highways reliable communications and high standard of living chile can be one of latin america s easiest transitions for american expats and retirees if not completely first world it is not far off the mark the country feels efficient well run and safe utilities work buses leave on time and you can stroll the streets without worry for american baby boomers our introduction to chile was the overthrow of president salvador allende in 1973 the aftermath of this event the long harsh dictatorship of general augusto pinochet proved more of a shock to chileans than everyone else it was largely out of character with this nation s history chile today is peaceful stable and prosperous santiago chile s capital city was established by spanish conquistador pedro de aldivia in 1540 over the next decade valdivia expanded the colony in chile founding la serena in 1544 it is this town that i would suggest you consider santiago is a great and modern city but the high levels of pollution can make it an uncomfortable place to be in la serena the skies are clear with little pollution la serena is a coastal community but more temperate than tropical temperatures are pleasant year round historically the biggest downside to chile for the potential expat retiree or property buyer has been the costs which couldn t compete with those of other latin american destinations however at today s exchange rates both the cost of living here and the cost of buying a second home are a bargain chile is another country where the residency process is relatively simple you can apply by mail and there s no minimum income requirement to get started if there s a disadvantage to chile it s the distance from the united states it s at least a nine hour flight

income non gaap and adjusted pre tax pre provision income non gaap as well as the adjusted efficiency ratio non gaap and the adjusted fee income ratio non gaap to monitor performance and believes these measures provide meaningful information to investors non interest expense gaap is presented excluding certain adjustments to arrive at adjusted non interest expense non gaap which is the numerator for the efficiency ratio net interest income and other financing income gaap is presented excluding certain adjustments related to tax reform to arrive at adjusted net interest income and other financing income non gaap non interest income gaap is presented excluding certain adjustments to arrive at adjusted non interest income non gaap which is the numerator for the fee income ratio adjusted non interest income non gaap and adjusted non interest expense non gaap are used to determine adjusted pre tax pre provision income non gaap net interest income and other financing income gaap on a taxable equivalent basis and non interest income are added together to arrive at total revenue on a taxable equivalent basis net interest income and other financing income on a taxable equivalent basis is presented excluding certain adjustments related to tax reform to arrive at adjusted net interest income and other financing income on a taxable equivalent basis non gaap adjustments are made to arrive at adjusted total revenue on a taxable equivalent basis non gaap which is the denominator for the fee income and efficiency ratios regions believes that the exclusion of these adjustments provides a meaningful base for period to period comparisons which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results of the company and predicting future performance these non gaap financial measures are also used by management to assess the performance of regions business it is possible that the activities related to the adjustments may recur however management does not consider the activities related to the adjustments to be indications of ongoing operations regions believes that presentation of these non gaap financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of the company on the same basis as that applied by management tangible common stockholders equity ratios have become a focus of some investors and management believes they may assist investors in analyzing the capital position of the company absent the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock analysts and banking regulators have assessed regions capital adequacy using the tangible common stockholders equity measure because tangible common stockholders equity is not formally defined by gaap or prescribed in any amount by federal banking regulations it is currently considered to be a non gaap financial measure and other entities may calculate it differently than regions disclosed calculations since analysts and banking regulators may assess regions capital adequacy using tangible common stockholders equity management believes that it is useful to provide investors the ability to assess regions capital adequacy on this same basis the calculation of the fully phased in pro forma common equity tier 1 cet1 is based on regions understanding of the final basel iii requirements for regions the basel iii framework became effective on a phased in approach starting in 2015 with full implementation beginning in 2019 the calculation includes estimated pro forma amounts for the ratio on a fully phased in basis regions current understanding of the final framework includes certain assumptions including the company s interpretation of the requirements and informal feedback received through the regulatory process regions understanding of the framework is evolving and will likely change as analysis and discussions with regulators continue because regions is not currently subject to the fully phased in capital rules this pro forma measure is considered to be a non gaap financial measure and other entities may calculate it differently from regions disclosed calculation a company s regulatory capital is often expressed as a percentage of risk weighted assets under the risk based capital framework a company s balance sheet assets and credit equivalent amounts of off balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories the aggregated dollar amount in each category is then multiplied by the prescribed risk weighted percentage the resulting weighted values from each of the categories are added together and this sum is the risk weighted assets total that as adjusted comprises the denominator of certain risk based capital ratios cet1 capital is then divided by this denominator risk weighted assets to determine the cet1 capital ratio the amounts disclosed as risk weighted assets are calculated consistent with banking regulatory requirements on a fully phased in basis non gaap financial measures have inherent limitations are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited although these non gaap financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company

thanks don and good morning everyone as noted in this mornings earnings release m t s results for the fourth quarter were characterized by continuation of the trends we ve been seeing over the first three quarters of 2018 these include further expansion of the net interest margin growth in net interest income growth in non interest revenues with trust fees remaining a highlight expenses that continue to be well controlled and a credit environment that remained solid one positive aspect of the fourth quarter s results was a notable pick up in commercial and industrial lending which contributed to aggregate net loan growth for the quarter highlights for the full year of 2018 include 7 growth in taxable equivalent net interest income driven by rising asset yields coming as the result of further increases in short term interest rates initiated by the with the manageable pace of deposit price increases credit improved from the already strong levels seen over the past three years with net charge offs as a percentage of loans the lowest since 1987 while loan growth did not meet our expectations that subdued growth enabled us to return the excess capital we generated back to our shareholders for the year m t repurchased 2 2 billion of common stock and paid 508 million of common dividends to our shareholders that resulted in a 146 payout ratio for the year the repurchase program resulted in 5 5 decline in average diluted shares for the full year of 2018 when compared with 2017 now let s look at the specifics for the fourth quarter diluted gaap earnings per common share were 3 76 for the fourth quarter of 2018 improved from 3 53 in the third quarter of 2018 and 2 01 in the fourth quarter of 2017 net income for the quarter was 546 million compared with 526 million in the linked quarter and 322 million in the year ago quarter on a gaap basis m t s fourth quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on average assets of 1 84 and an annualized return on average common equity of 14 8 this compares with rates of 1 8 and 14 08 respectively in the previous quarter included in the gaap results in the recent quarter were after tax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to 4 million or 0 03 per common share down slightly from the prior quarter consistent with our long term practice m t provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis from which we have only ever excluded the after tax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions when they occur m t s net operating income for the fourth quarter which excludes intangible amortization was 550 million compared with 531 million in the linked quarter and 327 million in 2017 s fourth quarter diluted net operating earnings per common share were 3 79 in the recent quarter compared with 3 56 in the third quarter of 2018 and 2 04 in the fourth quarter of 2017 net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders equity of 1 93 and 22 16 in the recent quarter the comparable returns were 1 89 and 21 in the third quarter of 2018 in accordance with the sec s guidelines this morning s press release contains a tabular reconciliation of gaap and non gaap results including tangible assets and equity both gaap and net operating earnings for the fourth quarters of 2018 and 2017 were impacted by certain noteworthy items included in the fourth quarter 2018 results was a 20 million contribution to the m t charitable foundation that amounted to 15 million after tax effect or 0 11 per common share also included in 2018 s fourth quarter was a 15 million reduction in m t s provision for income taxes arising from an irs approved change in tax treatment of certain loan fees which was retroactive to 2017 this also amounted to 0 11 per common share included in the fourth quarter of 2017 s results were 21 million of realized gains on investment securities which amounted to 14 million after tax effect or 0 09 per common share also reflected in the fourth quarter 2017 results was a contribution to the m t charitable foundation of 44 million which amounted to 27 million after tax effect or 0 18 per common share m t s effective tax rate for 2017 s fourth quarter was impacted by the changes to the federal corporate income tax rates m t s provision for income taxes for that quarter was increased by approximately 85 million amounting to 0 56 per common share as a result of those tax law changes as a reminder the year over year comparisons for both gaap and net operating earnings were impacted by the reduction in federal corporate income taxes for 2018 turning to the balance sheet and the income statement taxable equivalent net interest income was 1 065 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018 up 30 million from the linked quarter the net interest margin improved to 3 92 up 4 basis points from 3 88 in the linked quarter we estimate that the shorter we estimate that higher short term interest asset interest rates following the fed s september and december rate actions added a benefit to the margin of as much as 6 basis points cash interest received on acquired loans combined with a slightly higher level of prepayment fees added an estimated 2 basis points to the fourth quarter margin the higher average balance of funds placed on deposit with the fed had an estimated 4 basis point dilutive effect on the margin the higher cash balances were primarily the result of increased trust demand deposits and the continued slow pace of reinvestment of cash flows from investment securities average loans increased less than 1 compared with the previous quarter the ongoing run off of residential real estate loans primarily acquired hudson city mortgage loans was more than offset by growth in other loan categories which increased 754 million or 1 1 from the third quarter looking at the loans by category on an average basis compared with the linked quarter commercial and industrial loans were about 3 higher than in the prior quarter this included a 275 million seasonal increase in loans to auto dealers to finance their inventories combined with a 411 million increase in other c i loans commercial real estate loans were down less than 1 compared with the third quarter with modest growth in construction loans offset by a lower level of commercial mortgage loans as a result of paydowns and a decline in loans held for sale residential real estate loans which are largely comprised of mortgage loans acquired in the hudson city transaction continued the expected pace of paydowns the portfolio declined about 3 consistent with previous quarters consumer loans were up 2 with growth in indirect auto and recreation finance loans outpacing continuing declines in home equity lines and loans regionally in addition to the multi region seasonal rebound in floor plan lending pennsylvania and our metro region which includes new york city philadelphia and tarrytown realized the strongest growth in c i loans new jersey was the bright spot for cre loans average core customer deposits which exclude deposits received at m ts cayman islands office and cds over 250 000 were up about 4 annualized compared with the third quarter the higher levels of trust demand deposits i mentioned previously were the primary driver of the increase turning to non interest income non interest income totaled 481 million in the fourth quarter compared with 459 million in the prior quarter the quarter s results included 4 million of security valuation gains on our remaining portfolio of gse preferred stock compared with the 3 million loss in the third quarter mortgage banking revenues were 92 million in the recent quarter compared with 88 million in the linked quarter residential mortgage loans originated for sale were 412 million in the quarter down about 24 compared with the third quarter a decline in origination revenues was partially offset by higher residential servicing fees attributable to a sub servicing portfolio we on boarded during the third quarter total residential mortgage banking revenues including both origination and servicing activities were 57 million compared with 59 million in the prior quarter commercial mortgage banking revenues were 35 million in the fourth quarter up from 29 million in the linked quarter trust income was 135 million in the recent quarter up slightly from 134 million in the previous quarter and up 4 from 130 million in 2017 s fourth quarter new business generation continues to be strong while the weakness in equity markets during the quarter was a modest headwind service charges on deposit accounts were 109 million essentially unchanged from the prior quarter trading and fx gains were 17 million improved by 11 million from the prior quarter largely reflecting customer interest rate swap activity coming as a result of the improved pace of commercial lending turning to expenses operating expenses for the fourth quarter which exclude the amortization of intangible assets were 797 million as i mentioned earlier the fourth quarter s operating expenses reflected a 20 million contribution to the m t charitable foundation excluding the contribution operating expenses increased by 7 million from 770 million in 2018 s third quarter that increase reflects higher salaries and benefits attributable to one additional working day during the quarter and increased incentive compensation expense arising from last year s solid financial performance the remaining expense categories in aggregate were essentially flat with the prior quarter with the elimination of the fdic s large bank surcharge being partially offset by higher other cost of operations the efficiency ratio which excludes intangible amortization from the numerator and securities gains or losses from the denominator which does include the charitable contribution was 51 7 in the recent quarter increased slightly from 51 4 in the previous quarter the ratio was 54 7 in 2017 s fourth quarter next let s turn to credit our credit quality continues to be largely in line with the trends seen over the past few quarters indeed consistent with the trends seen over the past few years annualized net charge offs as a percentage of total loans were 17 basis points for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared with 7 basis points in the third quarter recall that the third quarter s results included a sizable 13 million recovery on a previously charged off cre loan the provision for credit losses was 38 million in the recent quarter essentially matching net charge offs the allowance for credit losses was 1 billion at the end of december and the ratio of the allowance to total loans was 1 15 at the end of 2018 non accrual loans increased by 23 million at december 31 compared with the end of the prior quarter the ratio of non accrual loans to total loans increased by 1 basis point ending the quarter at 1 01 we did see a rise in criticized loans during the quarter primarily driven by a couple of large loans with unique circumstances loans 90 days passed due on which we continue to accrue interest excluding acquired loans that had been marked to a fair value discounted acquisition were 223 million at the end of the quarter of these loans 192 million or 86 are guaranteed by government related entities turning to capital m t s common equity tier 1 ratio was an estimated 10 13 compared with 10 46 at the end of the third quarter the decline reflects retention the decline reflects earnings retention during the fourth quarter share repurchases and the impact of the improved loan growth which in turn led to higher end of period risk weighted assets m t repurchased 500 million of its common stock during the quarter as noted earlier for the full year of 2018 m t repurchased 12 3 million shares of its common stock valued at 2 2 billion and paid 508 million of common dividends to our shareholders this resulted in a 146 payout ratio for the year next i d like to take a moment to cover the key highlights of 2018 s full year results gaap based diluted earnings per common share were 12 74 up 46 from 8 70 in 2017 net income was 1 92 billion improved from 1 41 billion in the prior year these results produced returns on average assets and average common equity of 1 64 and 12 82 respectively net operating income which excludes intangible amortization was 1 94 billion improved from 1 43 billion in the prior year diluted net operating income per common share was 12 86 also up 46 from 8 82 in 2017 net operating income for 2018 expressed as a rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders equity was 1 72 and 19 09 respectively we note that the full year improvement in gaap and net operating earnings included a sizable benefit from lower us corporate tax rates however the year over year improvement notwithstanding lower taxes was significant pre tax gaap and net operating income both improved by 8 while diluted common shares outstanding declined by 5 5 as a result of the repurchase activity now turning to the outlook looking forward into 2019 our outlook is fairly consistent with the one we shared on this call last january while gdp growth may slow from the pace seen in 2018 we still expect it to be at a level consistent with the average annual rate of growth seen in the last seen since the last recession ended unemployment remains very low and both consumer and commercial customers financial positions are healthy consumer confidence remains relatively high although commercial customers are slightly more cautious in addition there continues to be measurable progress toward a regulatory approach tailored for banks like m t however with the usual caveat that events never unfold entirely in the manner you expect here are a few thoughts for the upcoming year loans outstanding declined on a full year average basis in 2018 but were up at the end of 2018 by about one half of 1 from the end of 2017 this reflected a 13 decline in residential mortgage loans offset by 4 aggregate growth in the other loan portfolios average total loans for the fourth quarter of 2018 were down about one half of 1 from the fourth quarter of 2017 average with a 13 decline in residential real estate loans offset by aggregate 3 growth in the other portfolios while as noted commercial and industrial loan growth in the past quarter was notably stronger than any quarter over the past two years paydowns continue to be a wildcard our pipeline as we enter 2018 2019 is consistent with or perhaps slightly better than it was at this point last year the cre market remains somewhat active most notably in the multifamily and healthcare sectors as was the case in 2018 cre loan growth for the coming year will be dictated by the rate at which existing construction projects are funded demand for new construction financing as well as for permanent financing and construction project as construction projects reach completion we expect continued run off of the residential real estate portfolio likely at a consistent low double digit pace although the dollar amount of the decline will continue to lessen as that portfolio gets smaller and we continue to see attractive pricing and underwriting standards in the consumer area given these trends our expectation for 2019 is that average total loans will grow on a full year basis at a low single digit pace if the improved pace of c i lending that m t experienced in the fourth quarter continues including slower paydowns we could exceed that rate as has been the case since the fed began to raise interest rates in late 2015 our outlook for the net interest margin is dependent on further rate actions a flat scenario should still lead to some expansion of the margin from 3 92 in the fourth quarter as the benefit from last year s september and december fed actions extend over a full calendar year any future rate actions by the fed in 2019 should they occur will potentially offer further moderate upside deposit pricing reactivity remains an area of focus and appears likely to be somewhat higher than in the past as the fed slows or halts its pace of short term rate increases there is a likelihood that deposit pricing pressures will continue for a period of time that outlook excludes the potential impact from cash balances brought in through wilmington trust which usually have an impact on the reported margin but would have a lesser incremental effect on revenue the level of cash on deposit at the fed was higher at year end than the average for the fourth quarter based on the current level of interest rates and reflecting the impact of the interest rate hedges we entered into last year our estimate for a hypothetical future 25 basis point increase in short term interest rates will bring a more modest benefit to the net interest margin than we ve seen previously perhaps in the area of 2 basis points to 4 basis points this embeds a series of assumptions on resultant deposit pricing reactivity based on those balance and margin assumptions we expect year over year growth in net interest income the higher interest rate environment will likely continue to challenge residential mortgage banking in 2018 specifically with respect to residential mortgage loan originations as we ve noted previously we have the capacity and appetite for additional owned msr servicing or sub servicing business this could offer a potential offset to slow originations the outlook for the remaining fee businesses remains consistent with our experience in 2018 with growth in the low single digit range with the exception of trust revenues which have been growing in a mid single digit or better pace excluding the 135 million addition to the litigation reserve from full year 2018 s operating expenses we expect low nominal growth in total operating expenses for 2019 over last year as is our usual practice we budget for modest positive operating leverage based on our revenue outlook this includes the full year benefit approximately 40 million from the elimination of the fdic surcharge we d remind you that we expect our usual seasonal increase in salaries and benefits in the first quarter of 2019 which primarily reflects annual equity incentive compensation as well as a handful of other items last year that increase was approximately 56 million in each of the first quarters of 2017 and 2018 we realized the benefit to our provision for income taxes when prior year equity grants vested at stock prices higher than the price at the grant date at current levels unless there is a meaningful rally in our stock price we wouldn t expect a similar benefit in 2019 s first quarter our outlook for credit remains balanced we just completed our fifth consecutive year of net charge off experience below 20 basis points for each of the past four years we ve cautioned that the trend can t continue and that losses will tick upward although not approaching long term averages i ll reiterate that outlook this year eventually i ll get this right there continue to be some modest pressures on nonperforming and criticized loans but there are no apparent weaknesses in particular industries or geographies regarding taxes our outlook for the effective tax rate for 2018 in the range of 25 to 26 prove to be conservative an approximate rate of 25 is more appropriate for 2019 unless some discrete items occur during the coming year as to capital while the fed implements its amended capital and stress testing rules for banks of our size we ll continue to execute our 2018 capital plan through the end of this year second quarter we expect final rules from the fed in time for our 2019 capital plan we expect to continue to manage our capital levels toward the lower end of our peer group as we believe our consistent approach to underwriting credit and the resultant low earnings volatility argues for maintaining our capital levels toward the lower end of that range maintained by our peers of course as you re aware our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth changes in interest rates political events and other macroeconomic factors which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future now let s open the call to questions before which laurie will briefly review the instructions questions and answers operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of ken zerbe of morgan stanley ken zerbe morgan stanley analyst great thanks good morning darren j king chief financial officer good morning ken ken zerbe morgan stanley analyst i guess maybe just starting off in terms of the very strong growth that we saw in c i lending this quarter presumably some of that is seasonal like the auto dealer piece that you mentioned but when you think about like going into 2019 or even where we stand today is the environment changing is the dialog with borrowers getting meaningfully better or is there something particularly unusual with this quarter that may slow in future quarters thanks darren j king chief financial officer sure so there was normal seasonal uptick in our auto floor plan balances which we have talked about on the third quarter call that also benefited from a couple of large relationships that we on boarded during the quarter so we d expect that number to stay around where it is at least for the first two quarters of the year when we look outside of floor plan and we look at other c i lending we typically see a little bit more activity in the fourth quarter than we do in the other quarters because year end tends to drive things to completion but when we look across industries and we look across geographies it was broad based the uptick which for us was encouraging and that it wasn t one sector or one geography driving the growth and so i think there is i would say there s comfort from our customers perspective in the economy but still a little bit of trepidation and we re hopeful that the dialog that we saw in the fourth quarter continues into the first and second and through the year but i guess it remains to be seen it s tough to draw conclusions off of just one quarter as we look underneath we continue to see solid activity as it regards to pay offs and paydowns and so it was really new originations that drove a lot of the a lot of the growth in the quarter and as we enter 2019 the pipelines are reasonably consistent maybe even slightly above where they were last year so we re guardedly optimistic about c i in 2019 ken zerbe morgan stanley analyst all right great and then just other question i had in terms of the trust demand deposits obviously the non interest bearing grew quite a bit this quarter which is great how sustainable are those or what s the typical pattern if there is a typical pattern for those thanks darren j king chief financial officer sure so you re right trust demand deposits were up sizeably in the fourth quarter we often see a little seasonality in those balances as well toward the end of the year at least we ve seen we saw that i think two years ago many of those will leave the balance sheet in the first quarter those tend to fluctuate depending on market activity that s going on so we expect those will be down closer to the levels that we saw in the third and second quarters of 2018 as we enter the first half of 2019 ken zerbe morgan stanley analyst okay perfect thank you very much operator your next question comes on line of john pancari of evercore isi john pancari evercore isi analyst good morning darren j king chief financial officer good morning john john pancari evercore isi analyst on the back to loan growth regarding the fourth quarter trends how much of a impact did you see in the quarter on the commercial side from the capital markets drying up a bit in december and then separately just trying to think about how to model out that commercial growth would you say that 6 end of period year over year growth that you saw in the commercial is something that could tail off a little bit from that and is that baked into your guidance or could it be back toward the low single digit range thanks darren j king chief financial officer so when we look at c i in the fourth quarter i guess starting with the question about the capital markets we did see a little bit of a freeze up in some of the capital markets activity but it didn t seem to affect our pay off and paydown levels in the fourth quarter so my take on that is that many of the funds that are supplying credit that are non banks still had money and they were still lending and that any of the activity that was going on would ve been new money that would have gone into the funds that isn t yet spoken for except that the larger end of the customer range which is typically above where we would compete when we look at the growth in the fourth quarter as i mentioned there always is a little bit of extra activity that seems to happen in the fourth quarter so 6 to me feels really high and we re not anticipating that rate of growth would continue in 2019 we expect that to come down we also expect to see some balances come off the balance sheet in the first half of the year and so we re a little bit more moderated on our outlook for commercial balance growth in the year closer to kind of the low single digit growth that we ve been talking about all the way long john pancari evercore isi analyst got it okay that s helpful and then separately on the operating leverage side i know you indicated that you still expect operating leverage for 2019 we saw i guess on what we view as a core basis maybe 350 basis points to 400 basis points positive operating leverage for 2018 what type of what magnitude of leverage do you think we could see as you look at 2019 darren j king chief financial officer so when we talk about operating leverage i guess it s important to make sure that we re all on the same page and what we re talking about and seeing so when we talk about modest positive operating leverage we exclude from the year over year calculations the 135 million that we added to the litigation reserve in 2018 s first quarter if you re looking on a gaap basis then expenses will be down but when you factor that out which we do then we expect some modest expense growth even factoring in the fdic but we expect revenue growth to be slightly above that and so we ll expect some modest operating leverage obviously depending on rates that could be hot more or less but based on this we look forward right now we think it s slightly positive john pancari evercore isi analyst okay got it thank you operator your next question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos of j p morgan steven alexopoulos jp morgan analyst hey good morning darren darren j king chief financial officer good morning steven alexopoulos jp morgan analyst i want to start on the nim so it s pretty clear you guys will benefit in the first quarter from the december hike but given your comments for december deposit pressures to persist the fed does go on hold how do you think nim progresses for the rest of the year darren j king chief financial officer so as we look forward alex we think the first quarter nim gets a little bit of benefit as we mentioned before from the full impact of the hike in december and then you ve got to remember i guess there s a couple of things we expect some of the cash balances to come down so those impact the margin and will impact it positively as well as the day count in the first quarter also helps the margin so with those three factors we re expecting an increase in the margin in the first quarter from there when we look forward with no further actions by the fed we would expect to kind of be within a couple of basis points plus or minus of where we end the first quarter through the rest of the year and then the question is obviously how the market reacts from a deposit pricing perspective in absence of any fed increases typically deposit pricing continues for a little bit after the fed stops and so we re anticipating some of that the caveat which i think is a little bit different is for many banks they ve got excess securities balances that we can look to given the change in lcr that we anticipate from new regulations and always a question is how loan growth behaves and if it continues like the fourth quarter for everyone and probably be a little more deposit pricing pressure if it comes back to where we have seen in the first three quarters of the year then there s probably a little bit less pressure so i know that gives you lots of things to think about and a lot of things that are on our mind so it s not exactly a straightforward question steven alexopoulos jp morgan analyst that certainly helps and then regarding the strong growth in c i quite a few other banks are pointing to their customers using their cash balances right to fund expansion too can you give us a sense if we put the impact from the trust related deposits aside like what did you see in non interest bearing deposits this quarter thanks darren j king chief financial officer yes so if you hold trust demand to the side our non interest bearing for the quarter was flat to maybe slightly down and if you look underneath there is some seasonality in non interest bearing balances that we see at m t because of the commercial the magnitude of the commercial non interest bearing that we hold and typically the commercial customers will hold deposits through the end of the year and into january in anticipation of making distributions to their principals and paying taxes so we also typically see a little bit of an outflow of non interest bearing in the first quarter in the commercial side for those reasons and then they slowly grow over the course of the year so outside of trust we re actually encouraged by the non interest bearing that we saw in the fourth quarter steven alexopoulos jp morgan analyst okay but are you also seeing customers use non interest bearing deposits to fund expansion darren j king chief financial officer yes we re seeing some of that we re also seeing them use their lines as a way to fund growth as well i guess my take on it is the behaviors they ve got the line and rates are still relatively low so they ll fund something on the line and then make a decision about making it into more permanent term debt or using their cash to eliminate it and so we re seeing a little bit but not a ton of use of the cash to invest we ve seen more if we see cash flowing out of accounts it tends to be going from non interest bearing into interest bearing accounts either on balance sheet or off steven alexopoulos jp morgan analyst okay great thanks for all the color operator your next question comes from the line of julian wellesley of loomis sayles julian wellesley loomis sayles co analyst hi i have a question about middle market lending competition in the past you ve talked about frothiness in this area in terms of spreads or terms and conditions how are you seeing things now darren j king chief financial officer i don t think we ve seen a material decrease in the competitiveness of the lending environment i think we saw as an industry in the fourth quarter a couple of things i think we saw a lot of activity that was pent up that was trying to get done by the end of the year as well as maybe a slight pause in the non bank markets but as i mentioned before we didn t see a material slowdown in payoffs and paydowns pricing had been dropping when we look at our pricing and spreads for the last couple of quarters they seemed to have leveled off so our take on that is that it was the impact of the tax reform kind of working its way through pricing and it seems to have stabilized and really when we see changes we were seeing we continue to see covenant light things out there if we see things on structure we re seeing longer interest only periods and maybe slight moves up in ltvs but it was minor so from our perspective the fourth quarter it didn t get worse but it didn t really get better julian wellesley loomis sayles co analyst okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of erika najarian of bank of america erika najarian bofa merrill lynch analyst hi good morning i wanted to ask darren a little bit more about the flexibility on the securities portfolio if you didn t have to adhere to lcr i m wondering if you could help us understand what the potential yield benefit would be or would you shrink your balance sheet and that would still be spread accretive darren j king chief financial officer so within the securities portfolio i think if you look at what our securities portfolio is today it s still higher than where we were before liquidity coverage ratio became a requirement and so we would never take that down to zero because we do want that liquidity but there is an option to look at that as one source to fund loan growth and given the spreads that here ph on securities versus the spreads on loans shifting that mix would be a positive for our margin if you look at what we ve been doing with that book over the last few quarters as longer dated mortgage backed securities have paid down we ve held that money in cash or invested it in shorter term treasuries just given where the rate environment has been but we look we don t have a specific plan for that portfolio this year per se but we consider it among our options versus overnight funding versus broker deposits versus bank debt and obviously customer deposit growth as an avenue to fund loan growth and we re always thinking about the impact on the duration of the balance sheet as well as the cost of funds as we consider all those options erika najarian bofa merrill lynch analyst thank you for that and just as a follow up as we think about the revenue outlook for 2019 if somehow it falls a little short of your budget is there flex in your expense outlook or expense budget to be able to create positive operating leverage even if the revenue outlook is a little bit softer than what we re expecting today darren j king chief financial officer sure good question i think the positive operating leverage comment there s a number of things that could impact that the biggest one is what happens with rates with the fed and if they turn from raising to decline if rates stay flat then we should be ok on positive operating leverage but to answer the question there is some flex in our expenses it doesn t happen it doesn t turn on a dime but over the course of a couple of quarters there are things that we have an ability to do to manage the pace of the expense growth but we re going to balance that off against the investments that we re making for the long term of the bank and if we have to sacrifice a little bit of operating leverage in the short term to make the investments we need to for the bank for the future we re not going to worry about that too much erika najarian bofa merrill lynch analyst got it and just one last question on the deposit repricing delay how many quarters typically does it take after the last fed rate hike in terms of the repricing for the repricing to cease or significantly die down darren j king chief financial officer well if you use the past as an indication of the future it s usually two to three quarters that can continue but it also depends on what the reactivity has been up to that point and so there s a lot of things that go into that and then the other question of course is how much loan demand is there and need for those funds so that s kind of what we ve seen in the past i think there s reason to believe that there are a couple of differences one positive and one negative to that history in the current environment but that s kind of what we ve seen in the past erika najarian bofa merrill lynch analyst got it thank you operator your next question comes from the line of peter winter of wedbush peter winter wedbush securities inc analyst good morning darren darren j king chief financial officer good morning peter peter winter wedbush securities inc analyst i wanted to ask about credit quality obviously it s very strong but you ve got nonperforming assets that increased a little bit two quarters in a row you mentioned the criticized loans increasing i m just wondering if you can just give a little bit of color there and then secondly with the outlook for better loan growth next year or 2019 would you expect to start adding to reserves darren j king chief financial officer sure so i guess i started at the high level and look at delinquency and where delinquency trends have been we haven t seen anything that gives us cause for concern in any of the books we ve seen a little bit of an increase as you noted in year end in non performers and the allowance actually the allowance is pretty flat in non performers and when we look under the covers of what s going on there we continue to not really see any particular industry as it relates to c i any particular class of real estate as it relates to cre any particular geography from a consumer perspective that causes us concern now that said we re m t and we re paranoid so we re going back through the book again to see if there s anything that we re missing but generally as we ve gone through the non performers there are also a couple of larger non performers and a couple of larger criticized that i mentioned before that are very specific situations so we re comfortable with where things are but we re m t so we re paranoid peter winter wedbush securities inc analyst okay and then just the possibly adding to reserves with a better outlook for loan growth this year darren j king chief financial officer yes i mean obviously we go through our allowance every quarter and we ve got a process that we follow every quarter looking at the grades of our loans and the charge off rates and obviously we have a little higher loan growth it would be reasonable to expect that the provision would go up with it peter winter wedbush securities inc analyst got it thanks darren operator your next question comes from the line of geoffrey elliott of autonomous research geoffrey elliott autonomous research llp analyst hello thanks for taking the question another one on those criticized loans can you give us a bit more of a sense of the magnitude of the increase just give us a feel for how significant or not significant it is and then anything on the industries the types of loans any kind of color around those that would be helpful thanks darren j king chief financial officer sure it s going to be a couple of 100 million increase in the quarter compared to third quarter and within there there s two or three large loans over 50 million that we ve got our eye on and it s a variety of industries and various different reasons why in one case we ve got a company that has a debt service coverage ratio that got a little close to our trigger but when we look at that company and we look through its income statement and we work with them we can see that they have opportunities to change their expense profile and rectify that situation when we look at another one we see some excessive leverage that was helped by some of the non bank financials so there s a story to each one and there are paths for them to not remain on that criticized list but because we re doing our work and we re watching what s going on we put them on that list to make sure that we pay attention to it and try to keep them from becoming defaults geoffrey elliott autonomous research llp analyst understood thanks very much operator your next question comes from the line of frank schiraldi of sandler o neill frank schiraldi sandler o neill analyst good morning darren j king chief financial officer good morning frank schiraldi sandler o neill analyst just one question just on the this might be splitting hairs darren but just in terms of the december rate hike that we already got you talked about 2 basis points to 4 basis points of benefit and if we get any additional rate hikes perhaps in 2019 and in the past you guys talked about 5 bps to 8 bps i think of benefit so i was just wondering does the december rate hike the benefit you are likely to get in the first quarter from it is that somewhere in between or is the 2 bps to 4 bps a good number to use there darren j king chief financial officer that s not a bad number to use because we have gotten some benefit of it already right and we talked about 5 bps to 8 bps before so that s probably a good number to use frank schiraldi sandler o neill analyst okay great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy of rbc gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst hi darren how are you darren j king chief financial officer good how are you gerard gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst good thank you on your c i loan growth that you saw this quarter when you look at it what percentage of it came from existing customers versus new customers that you won in the quarter darren j king chief financial officer that s a great question if we look at our loan book we generally get the majority of our loan growth from our existing customers just because on a percentage basis off the portfolio that s where a lot of the growth comes from we did see some new customer ads particularly in new jersey we noted new jersey is a strong growth market i ll remind everyone once again that it continues to be basically a de novo so it s off a small base but it was a really nice ad in terms of what we refer to as prospect conversions in the quarter but when you look in aggregate the bulk tends to come from the existing customer base gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst very good and then speaking of new jersey i think you said in your opening remarks you saw some good commercial real estate loan growth in new jersey was that construction or mortgage commercial real estate term mortgage and just what types of properties were you able to finance darren j king chief financial officer so i don t have the specifics for new jersey on those ones gerard but the trend we saw in the quarter and have seen for much of the years activity in multifamily and in hotel space so i would expect that in new jersey we saw some of that but just given our presence in new jersey and the fact that we re growing i think it s a little bit broader than we would see some permanent mortgage business there as well gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst and then lastly obviously m t has always distinguished itself on your ability to manage your capital very effectively granted the post financial crisis has changed that a bit but once you come out of ccar what are the advantages that you guys are thinking you re going to have in terms of managing your capital once you don t have to go through the annual ccar test darren j king chief financial officer so we re still waiting for final word on what all of this is going to mean both in terms of what the process is with the regulators as well as whether the new stress capital buffer framework comes into effect i guess what we re hopeful for is that we start to end up in a place a little bit like the lcr or where the lcr seems to be evolving and that it s part of your normal supervisory process that you re reviewing your position with the regulators but then you have a little bit more flexibility to manage that part of the balance sheet without some of the specifics of what you can do and how much you can do in any given time period and i think we just look for the ability to be able to deploy our shareholders capital either into customer growth if they need support and we want to be there to provide lending to help them grow their businesses and when they re not able to do that we want to be able to take that capital that we can t put to use in the business and return to the shareholders and kind of not have as many restrictions on how much we can return in any quarter that we can be a little bit more dynamic in how we manage the balance sheet gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of matt o connor of deutsche bank matthew o connor deutsche bank ag analyst hi good morning darren j king chief financial officer good morning matthew o connor deutsche bank ag analyst just wondering if you could talk about how other bank ceos are thinking about the stocks the environment obviously you have a lot of capital you have been acquirer in the past i m just wondering if the sell off in the stocks and risk assets in general and increased macro concerns may be bringing some people to the table or thinking a little bit differently than say three or six months ago darren j king chief financial officer so i guess i haven t spent a lot of time with other bank ceos to know exactly what they re thinking but when you look at the market and what s happened with bank stocks and with multiples the whole industry is rerated down basically together i think we had a better december than some others did but we re still all relatively down so for someone to think about selling or for acquisition math to work it s about the difference between the buyer and the seller in some cases and the relative differences hasn t changed from what it was a few months ago and i don t think we ve heard too much where people are capitulating and thinking that the world is coming to an end and it s time to sell my bank matthew o connor deutsche bank ag analyst okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of christopher spahr of wells fargo christopher spahr wells fargo securities llc analyst hi thank you the trading line item a pretty good pick up quarter over quarter actually compared to actually the last few years on a quarterly basis and you attributed to pick up in c i lending given your commentary on c i lending going forward or just loan growth going forward do you think that trading levels sustainable or we kind of revert back to what we ve seen in the last few years in trading darren j king chief financial officer yes the trading tends to go in lockstep with originations and it s not just c i lending originations that happened to have a big impact on the balance sheet this quarter but originations continued in the quarter on both cre and c i and both of those sectors will use swaps to manage their interest rate risk and so the trading account should move in lockstep with loan origination activity and so as that moves up or down the trading revenue should move up or down as well christopher spahr wells fargo securities llc analyst and just as a follow up the other commentary on fee revenues excluding kind of the trust if that takes into account kind of that kind of outlook correct darren j king chief financial officer yes christopher spahr wells fargo securities llc analyst all right thank you operator your final question comes from the line of brian klock of keefe bruyette woods brian klock keefe bruyette woods analyst hey good morning darren darren j king chief financial officer good morning brian brian klock keefe bruyette woods analyst so i wanted to kind of follow up on maybe you had a discussion earlier about some of the lcr and sort of thoughts going forward in managing your liquidity i guess looking at page 14 in your press release and the year over year 18 versus 17 the securities portfolio has come down quite a bit since 2017 darren j king chief financial officer yes brian klock keefe bruyette woods analyst and just thinking about it s now on an end of period basis at the end of the year it s even below the fourth quarter average of 13 billion so i know you ve had deposit run off to some hudson city time deposits et cetera i guess how do you think about that level of the securities portfolio in 2018 do you think this is i guess you guys have used this just with other hedging and other telco strategies but this is an area where this will grow from here or this where do you think it might stabilize at on the security side darren j king chief financial officer sure so on that page brian when we look at securities and the portfolio we look at it in combination with the top line there interest bearing deposits at banks or cash the fed and when we have been seeing payoffs and paydowns of the securities portfolio depending on where rates were we ve been holding some of that in cash because the rate we re getting in cash is within 10 basis points or 15 basis points of what you could get at one year treasury and within our securities portfolio we ve kind of had a bit of a barbell if you will between at mortgage backed securities being kind of longer dated for rate and then the shorter end to manage duration and so we ve been just allowing some of the securities portfolio to go into cash and that s why you see some of those cash balances increasing some of it was absolutely because of growth in trust demand but some of it is also just shifting between securities and cash and so if you look at the combined they are down a little bit but it s not as quite as dramatic as what the securities might look like on its own brian klock keefe bruyette woods analyst got it so if i think about average earning assets in 19 versus 18 so that anything outside of loans whether it s the interest bearing deposits fed fund security that s going to be around 19 billion on average which it seems like it s been the last two years so the earning asset growth could be higher than whatever you put into loan growth will grow your earning assets from the 106 8 million ph that you had for 2018 darren j king chief financial officer maybe maybe not you could see switch between categories right you could see just within the loan book switch between mortgage versus the other categories because of that continued run down and then within the asset on the asset side of the balance sheet between securities and loan so aggregate earning asset growth might be flat to slightly down depending on how we choose to fund some of the loan growth brian klock keefe bruyette woods analyst okay and just a real follow up quick follow up question on the fee income guidance so when you talked about trust being mid single digit because there s good momentum in that business so with the mortgage banking be included with all the other in that low single digit guide or is mortgage banking expected to be a little softer because of some of the headwinds on originations darren j king chief financial officer it s included with everything else brian klock keefe bruyette woods analyst okay thanks for your time darren darren j king chief financial officer sure brian operator thank you i ll now return the call to don macleod for any additional or closing

this paper was originally written for the carter center s symposium on the 40th anniversary of the establishment of u s china diplomatic relations the u s china relationship is confronting its most daunting challenge in the forty years since the two countries established diplomatic ties current trends portend steadily worsening relations over the long term with increasingly adverse consequences for all actors involved specifically beijing and washington are transitioning from a sometimes contentious yet mutually beneficial relationship to an increasingly antagonistic mutually destructive set of interactions the often positive and optimistic forces interests and beliefs that sustained bilateral ties for decades are giving way to undue pessimism hostility and a zero sum mindset in almost every area of engagement both sides bear responsibility for this pervasive deterioration but at present the united states under president donald trump is unquestionably contributing most publicly to it primarily through its ill considered rhetorical and other overreactions to perceived chinese misbehavior while nothing about this degenerating relationship is inevitable despite the uninformed alarmist predictions of doomsayers on both sides the threat of an even more precipitous and dangerous decline in the relationship is very real and demands serious corrective measures to avert a potential catastrophe michael d swaine swaine was a senior fellow at the carnegie endowment for international peace and one of the most prominent american analysts in chinese security studies more dalzell60 to understand how we have reached this point and how to put the sino american relationship on a more positive path analysts first need to dispel the simplistic and largely negative misconceptions about the past that predominate today especially in the united states next observers need to grasp the highly adverse structural and attitudinal trends driving the current negative dynamic the serious dangers these trends pose for both countries and the world including the possibility of a new cold war and the high stakes involved in correcting or mitigating them from that vantage point policymakers may better discern which actions each side must take to stabilize and strengthen the relationship for their mutual benefit forty years of benefits and challenges since january 1979 the u s china relationship has witnessed enormous levels of both positive and negative change yet most often these changes have been beneficial on the positive side the two nations have developed a mutually productive array of ties and interactions in a growing multitude of areas from trade and investment to social and cultural exchanges as well as common initiatives for dealing with global threats such as climate change wmd proliferation and pandemics in the process china has become vastly more integrated with the rest of the international community more observant of international laws norms and procedures and more open to a much greater level of social economic and political influence than ever obtained prior to 1979 for serious students of the history of u s china relations before and after normalization there is simply no question that despite recent setbacks in some areas discussed below beijing has made enormous strides largely as a result of its opening to the outside and its adoption of market based economic development these advances have introduced greatly increased standards of living improved social infrastructure wider freedom to travel and express a variety of views and more openness to foreign influences of all sorts at many intervals along the way understandings between washington and beijing in particular have provided a major impetus for such chinese gains today within the washington policy community and the trump administration one often hears the mistaken assertion that china s progress over the last forty years has come at america s expense on the contrary these advances have tangibly benefitted the united states and many other countries china s reform driven development has contributed substantially to overall global growth most notably during recessions like the 2008 2010 downturn when the u s economy was in dire straits u s traders and investors who engage with china have made significant profits for their shareholders in the united states and elsewhere until the trump administration made the destructive decision to withdraw from the paris climate accord beijing and washington had cooperated to pursue benefits not only for themselves but for the world in curbing climate change moreover even though beijing has certainly stolen u s technology in various areas chinese investments in and technical exchanges with the united states contributed greatly to the development of cutting edge technologies in silicon valley and beyond and still do americans have also obtained economically priced and increasingly well made products designed assembled or manufactured in china and beijing has over the years provided critical diplomatic and political assistance albeit not always as much as washington has desired in addressing such global problems such as terrorism wmd proliferation humanitarian assistance disaster relief and pandemics finally for nearly two decades prior to 1989 the united states benefitted from close military and security cooperation with beijing directed at their common adversary the soviet union this strategic alignment directed at moscow was one of the main reasons for establishing u s china diplomatic relations along with washington s desire to fully integrate beijing into the international community and tap into the country s enormous potential market and despite today s oft heard refrain u s engagement with beijing was never predicated on the expectation that it would inevitably produce a politically democratic china at most some u s leaders hoped for but did not require greater levels of largely undefined liberalization in many spheres none of the above positive outcomes for the united states and the world would have occurred if washington had clung to the adversarial posture toward beijing that began with the establishment of the people s republic of china in 1949 and continued for the ensuing two decades nor would they have occurred if the united states had limited its diplomatic opening in the 1970s and 1980s to a few narrow areas of military cooperation and assistance on the negative side a number of challenges and setbacks have also accompanied the many advances since the two sides established full diplomatic relations in 1979 beijing and washington have differed significantly over the handling of many critical issues in ways that often reflected their differing political systems the legacy of hostility and conflict resulting from the korean war and the cold war and their contrasting political and social cultures and beliefs these policy divergences included the handling of volatile disputes over regional sovereignty and security issues such as taiwan controversial maritime claims along china s periphery and the korean peninsula they have extended as well to disputes over reciprocity and fairness in trade and investment cyber and other forms of espionage human rights practices within and beyond china and other international laws and global norms many of these differences have existed since 1949 others emerged or gained greater currency as normalization unfolded and still others came about only after china s development and impact on asia and the world reached massive proportions in the early 2000s for the most part however until recent years these differences while generating significant temporary downturns in the relationship usually following disruptive or unexpected actions such as the tiananmen square massacre of 1989 did not fundamentally alter the underlying strategic economic and political interests of both countries in maintaining workable and productive relations in fact by the advent of the twenty first century it had become clear that in addition to the above long standing bases for a strong u s china relationship a range of new or greatly increased largely international challenges and opportunities had emerged to reinforce both countries interest in preserving cooperative relations these included unprecedented levels of interdependence among the u s china and many other states resulting from the accelerated globalization of economic technological and social exchanges and the equally unprecedented emergence of nontraditional threats such as climate change environmental degradation global pandemics terrorism and transnational crime it became increasingly clear that the united states and china could not effectively deal with such deeply rooted problems on their own or even bilaterally successful management would require truly international forms of cooperation guided largely by those nations with the most wealth resources capabilities and intellectual capital namely the west led by the united states and both china and japan challenges become hostilities the impact of chinese repression american hyper nationalism and a shifting power balance unfortunately the positive momentum in the relationship has not lasted while new challenges and opportunities initially served to justify and compel greater u s china cooperation in the first decade of the new century three other major unprecedented negative sets of trends both domestic and international also appeared around the same time these trends greatly aggravated the differences between the united states and china and eventually overshadowed the many positive factors at work in the relationship the first trend emerged in the 1990s and 2000s and produced two serious negative outcomes severe damage to beijing s reputation in the west which undermined expectations of china s continued reform and opening and a deepening of chinese suspicions of the united states and other democracies these developments stemmed from beijing s response to three major challenges to ccp rule the collapse of communist and authoritarian states caused in part by the explosion of rapid internet based forms of communication with freer societies the emergence of unprecedented levels of corruption and socioeconomic disorder in china in the 2000s largely as a result of decades of market led rapid economic growth and the failure to develop an effective legal system and more dangerous forms of domestic terrorism and unrest occurring primarily in the ethnic minority areas of tibet and xinjiang this triple threat to ccp rule greatly heightened the insecurities of china s leaders prompting efforts to purge the party ranks strengthen overall party controls throughout chinese society and increase the economic role of the state those changes began during the jiang zemin and hu jintao eras but have intensified greatly under xi jinping most recently such perceived threats to the party s leadership have caused xi to build up his personal position within the party thus undermining the gradual evolution of the chinese political system toward a more predictable collective and institutionalized pattern of rule as a result of beijing s actions china s image among democratic states already damaged by the tiananmen square massacre of 1989 declined much further as did western confidence in china s commitment to pursue continued growth through greater opening marketization and support for the rule of law to compound this blow to the relationship chinese leaders have become more deeply suspicious of western and especially u s views and policies toward china indeed by the mid 1990s the ccp leadership concluded that washington and other democratic nations had contributed decisively to the collapse or weakening of one party systems elsewhere and might be seeking similar ends for the prc regime such fears and suspicions were magnified by the long standing deeply rooted sense of resentment toward the west many chinese feel as a result of china s so called century of humiliation a second set of highly negative trends that emerged in the 2000s involved domestic developments in the u s and the west adding more suspicions on both sides while also emboldening china s leaders in potentially dangerous ways specifically the 2008 global recession the deepening polarization of american society and the resulting near paralysis of the u s political system in dealing with critical domestic issues such as ballooning health care and entitlement costs and huge government deficits created two negative consequences for the u s china relationship one is that many chinese leaders somewhat tentatively concluded that the united states had likely entered a period of systemic decline in which america s ability to challenge or contain china s rise would drop significantly and the american model of pluralist democracy and market led economic growth would gradually lose its lustre this dual perception has strengthened the outlook of those within the chinese leadership including xi who support a more confident use of china s growing economic and military capabilities to push back against washington s supposed containment efforts and more vigorously defend or advance beijing s expanding interests overseas this approach has largely eclipsed the long standing emphasis of the deng xiaoping era on maintaining a relatively low international profile it has given greater license to those within china who prefer to give vent more vigorously to long held resentments against the west or against so called hostile western forces usually referring to the united states even more worrisome in the united states and other western countries worsening domestic economic and social problems exacerbated by the unprecedented surge of both legal and illegal non white immigrants into europe and the united states that began in the 2010s have led to the emergence of chauvinistic forms of nationalism hostile to china and other countries according to the line of thinking currently so prominent in american politics the globalization of economic and social systems most acutely manifested by beijing s conspicuous economic impact on americans daily lives lies at the root of growing domestic economic inequality job losses social injustice weakened national sovereignty and threatened cultural identity in the united states such hyper nationalism is reflected most distinctively in the extremist views of president trump he has criticized u s politicians and global corporations for selling out u s workers and the national interest in general by their support for unfair multilateral trade agreements and by moving manufacturing facilities to foreign countries most notably for u s china relations trump and his supporters have singled out china for special denunciation when they blast a range of other countries as economic predators or cheaters that aim to enrich themselves at america s expense a third major factor contributing to the overwhelming negative dynamics emerging in u s china relations is china s very rapid growth which has passed certain key thresholds over the last eighteen years china has become the largest trading power in the world surpassed the japanese economy to become the second largest economic power overall become a major source of innovation in key high tech sectors accumulated massive foreign exchange reserves and transformed its military from a defense oriented force focused mainly on the homeland and taiwan to a more expansive sophisticated force capable of operating at significant distances from china while contributing to global growth and the rise of living standards in many countries the systemic changes arising from these developments have enhanced chinese confidence abroad while greatly stoking american fears by some measures china is now poised to equal america s military footprint in the western pacific which would effectively end seventy years of u s maritime dominance in that critical region in addition beijing is using its economic resources to create what it hopes will become a vast network of interlinked economic structures and relationships extending from china to europe and africa via both land and maritime routes the so called belt and road initiative bri it is also supporting or leading a variety of other multilateral and bilateral economic and security initiatives such as new investment banks asian economic associations and strategic partnerships with u s friends and adversaries alike that could significantly shape the contours of the international system in new directions further as mentioned above china is more assertively advancing by economic political and military means its claims to disputed areas along its maritime periphery from northeast to southeast asia thus alarming many nearby states chinese confidence and assertiveness has increased but certain more pessimistic chinese sentiments have surfaced as well providing more fuel for the fears of american hyper nationalists in recent years slowing growth and rising wages have intensified worries among chinese economic policy specialists about the so called middle income trap this has produced a policy consensus regarding the urgency of transforming china s economy from a labor intensive to a more competitive innovation driven economic model that in turn seems to underlie china s present very conspicuous efforts to propel china into the top ranks of high tech nations at the fastest possible pace by fair means or foul for instance while spending billions of dollars on legitimate research and development some chinese entities now also engage in unprecedented levels of cyber espionage physical theft coercive contract arrangements and other underhanded efforts to obtain cutting edge technologies while certainly not justifying the blanket label of economic predator applied by the trumpists see below these activities along with perceived unfair protections of chinese domestic industries have significantly aggravated relations with more developed rule of law based nations such as the united states of particular note they have contributed greatly to the general souring of attitudes toward the china market evident among many u s businesses thus weakening a major historical pillar of strong u s china relations a relationship adrift and taking on water as a result of all the negative changes outlined above the common and in some areas growing strategic logic economic incentives and societal ties that long anchored the u s china relationship in the past are today rapidly disintegrating under a tidal wave of growing mutual suspicion faulty interpretations worst case assumptions about motives and zero sum policy calculations although this is happening in both washington and beijing it is at this time particularly evident in the united states american policy under trump has turned its back on the shared chinese and american interest in combating common transnational threats such as climate change and has withdrawn from or undermined potential mechanisms such as the trans pacific partnership and a revised world trade organization agreement for more effectively managing bilateral and multilateral economic problems instead the trump administration has adopted crude sledgehammer like economic policies centered on the imposition of legally questionable tariffs to force beijing to submit to fully open its markets and eliminate state involvement in the chinese economy even more ominously trump administration strategy statements like the 2017 u s national security strategy the 2018 summary of the national defense strategy and the so called u s free and open indo pacific strategy explicitly label china as a fundamental existential threat to western interests these statements allege that beijing is plotting to build a revisionist sino centric world order fundamentally incompatible with the u s led liberal international system to support this distorted viewpoint and justify its draconian actions u s officials with the implicit endorsement of too much of the overly accepting american media now depict beijing as a proponent of debt trap diplomacy involving the use of loans to subjugate developing states as a vigorous practitioner of destructive predatory trade and investment practices toward the united states and others and as a nation aiming to dominate asia and eventually the world by a combination of economic and military means in truth these accusations grossly inflate and oversell genuine american and western concerns rooted in observable facts for example while several recipients of chinese infrastructure and development loans face serious repayment problems often due to reckless and inexperienced practices on both sides there is no conclusive evidence that china is intentionally seeking to drive countries into debt problems to gain control over their assets policies etc proponents of the debt trap diplomacy argument generally base their conclusion on a single case hambantota port in sri lanka while ignoring the other tools china uses to deal with bilateral debt problems and even in that case there is no publicly available information indicating that when the export import bank of china made its first loan to sri lanka to support this project the ultimate purpose was to help china gain a concession to develop and operate the port similarly the charge that beijing is a predatory and mercantilistic economic power places a simplistic distorting label on a much more complex reality yes china s government excessively supports many industries steals technology and limits access to many domestic markets these are problems that although by no means unique to china need addressing forthrightly yet they should not obscure the fact that china is absolutely not a non market economic power the core of its economy remains driven by a huge number of privately owned market driven small and medium sized enterprises and the majority of its exports are produced or assembled by foreign corporations or joint chinese foreign ventures moreover if china were a purely predatory economic power it would not be the largest single contributor to global growth since 2008 according to the world bank thirdly despite constant repetition by officials and pundits alike there is no substantive evidence that beijing is pursuing a deliberate strategy to dominate asia and the world militarily and overturn the existing global order beijing is certainly acquiring military capabilities that undermine america s long standing predominance in that realm most notably and almost exclusively in the western pacific and it at times uses its military and para military power to intimidate other claimants to disputed maritime territories in the east and south china seas yet the former behavior is a perhaps understandable response to beijing s desire to reduce the continued vulnerability of its growing domestic and foreign assets to america s still dominant power not proof of a belligerent intent to take over the region although this could change if the current rivalry deepens greatly the latter behavior is certainly very troubling but speaks to the need for a binding code of conduct that prohibits such actions along with limits on specific types of militarization in sensitive areas beijing has shown no signs that it would reject either development to the contrary it has professed some support for them and should be pressed more to back up its words with concrete actions the u s should do the same finally the idea that china wants to overturn the global order is perhaps the most distorted accusation of all beijing has benefitted enormously from the post wwii economic order it also has taken advantage of that order in at times unacceptable ways and seeks to modify it to better reflect its growing influence this suggests the need to adapt existing institutions such as the wto and imf to more reasonably reflect china s expanding global impact while providing clearer more comprehensive and enforceable rules of behavior acceptable to all powers beijing is certainly not a proponent of pluralist liberal democracy and in that sense does not support regional or global norms or practices designed to expand such systems internationally but it is far from clear that the continued expansion of democratic systems is essential to the maintenance of the global order indeed in addition to supporting to varying degrees the major economic pillars of that order as noted above china in fact supports many others including wmd non proliferation agreements efforts to protect against nontraditional security threats such as terrorism pandemics climate change and international crime and many tenants of the un charter e g regarding the restrictive use of force to resolve inter state disputes this is hardly evidence of a desire to replace the existing order with a largely undefined revisionist order as washington now alleges lacking conclusive evidence for the overblown categorical condemnations they tend to fashion the trump administration its supporters and some individual scholars or analysts seek to buttress their accusations with arm waving references to the general history of rising powers realpolitik theories of anarchic struggle among power maximizing states or assumptions about foreign policy behavior based almost solely on a state s political system ignoring the obvious benefits accruing from the balanced u s china policy of the past the trump administration many republican and democratic members of congress and some china experts have endorsed a new highly distorted narrative of a failed american policy of concession weakness and dashed expectations that has allegedly permitted beijing to undermine u s interests at almost every turn although u s policymakers have certainly made mistakes over the past forty years as indicated above the history of u s china relations since diplomatic normalization belies this distorted viewpoint china and the united states have not always agreed and they have sometimes sharply diverged but they have nevertheless managed to work together to strengthen the regional and global economy during difficult times apply pressure on aspiring nuclear weapons states such as iran and north korea and deal with a growing variety of transnational threats the idea of a failed u s policy line provides a simple seductive story for posturing politicians ambitious former officials and iconoclastic trumpists looking for ways to blame america s ills on both the incompetence of past administrations and of course the treacherous chinese while current u s policies are most at fault for driving the current downward spiral in u s china relations beijing is far from blameless as suggested above in recent years and especially under xi chinese propaganda has become more hostile toward supposed foreign threats to domestic stability and prosperity chinese officials at many levels are now more assertive in cautioning the public about interactions with foreigners in addition the overall expansion of intrusive chinese government surveillance within china is extending to foreign business leaders ngo staff and students and beijing is now resorting to truly outrageous attempts to control domestic unrest in ethnic minority areas by placing hundreds of thousands of its own citizens in so called reeducation and training camps in violation of chinese laws and processes all of these actions contribute to the growing climate of suspicion and hostility in the relationship the chinese government only worsens this situation by denying the legitimacy of virtually all criticisms of its behavior while mouthing simplistic self serving slogans and platitudes such as repeated references to china s peaceful intentions its purely defense oriented security strategy and its commitment to win win outcomes with all nations such propagandistic emanations simply heighten u s suspicions and hyperbole and undercut the arguments of those seeking a more fact based pragmatic relationship in sum the u s china relationship is now not merely adrift without a strong anchor it is taking on water worse yet some on board seem to be arguing that it should be allowed to sink looking to the future the possibility of more serious crises and a destructive new cold war amid this dangerous downward spiral both beijing and washington have fewer incentives to undertake meaningful confidence building measures much less seek out areas of mutual accommodation and restraint on the contrary this state of affairs inclines both sides to rely more heavily on military and other coercive means to signal the firmness of their resolve it heightens sensitivities to perceived challenges both real and imagined thereby increasing the possibility of truly dangerous crises even over relatively minor disputes the danger of such crises is most evident in the western pacific where china s growing military and economic strength and the presence of several volatile points of contention between the two powers from korea and taiwan to the south china sea could result in otherwise avoidable miscalculations as each side seeks to push back against perceived tests of its determination indeed in the absence of serious and sustained efforts to moderate this current ugly dynamic the chances of a significant political military crisis in the not too distant future are increasing this could take many forms beijing could decide that what it regards as aggressive u s containment and pushback efforts justify unprecedented displays of chinese determination in the form for example of the permanent deployment of military forces on its artificial islands in the south china sea and the declaration of a corresponding air defense identification zone adiz for its part washington could decide that it needs to augment radically its deterrence capacities regarding taiwan by allowing u s warships to visit the island on a regular basis worse it could take steps to block improvements in cross strait relations so as to ensure that a now strategically valuable taiwan remains separate from mainland china this would be a direct violation of washington s long standing one china policy that has ensured peace with beijing for forty years for some misguided proponents of a supposedly more realistic adversarial relationship such crises would presumably serve a positive function by strengthening public and elite determination to push back against the other side in the u s such individuals seem to believe that only the threat or actual implementation of a complete disengagement and containment effort against beijing can generate the resources and strength of will necessary to prevent china from dominating the west and destroying the global order some advocates of this reckless and ill conceived approach insist that its positive results will prevent the emergence of a new cold war environment by forcing beijing to submit to u s demands in truth such an approach would almost inevitably produce a new cold war especially if u s russia relations continue to worsen and sino russian relations continue to improve and such an environment would prove far more destructive than beneficial for all nations concerned that is largely because u s and chinese interests today are more compatible and the fortunes of the two protagonists and the world more intertwined than was ever the case during the original cold war unlike present day beijing and washington cold war era russia and the united states were largely separated from one another economically culturally and socially few russians lived and worked abroad and few foreigners beyond those from the eastern bloc worked and lived in russia moreover economic exchange between the united states and the soviet union was minimal few countries relied heavily on russia for prosperity and stability unlike moscow then beijing today exerts major and deepening influence on countries both in asia and around the globe its economic and technological advances are heavily intertwined with many nations in the west and beyond and its military poses an increasingly credible challenge to u s military predominance in asia as noted above the huge potential risks and dangers inherent in the current situation are compounded by the fact that the united states is more insecure less confident more internally divided and more dependent on the world now than it was during the height of the cold war as a result in a new cold war a stronger china would be more likely to overestimate its ability to outmaneuver and pressure the united states by the same token a more insecure yet still very strong washington could prove more susceptible to overreaction than it was in the face of soviet cold war threats taken together these factors indicate that efforts by either or both sides to isolate or undermine the other in the spirit of the cold war of the 1950s and early 1960s will produce major dangers for both countries and other nations for that reason many other capitals would resist attempts by washington or beijing to compel them to choose sides in a zero sum struggle for dominance the resulting disruption would severely undermine the world economy cripple global and regional cooperation on many issues and impel some nations to devote more resources to military defense instead of economic development the net result of all this would be the increased likelihood of instability and crisis within nations within regions and ultimately across the globe the path back to a more realistic productive relationship given the above there is little doubt that the u s china relationship will be more contentious and intensely competitive for the foreseeable future than it has been at any time over the past forty years regardless of who leads either country that said more intensely competitive interactions do not necessarily mean a sharply confrontational zero sum relationship of the kind now favored by the trump administration and likely advocated by some in china there is an alternative to the emergence of what would amount to a new extremely destructive cold war the challenge for both sides is to develop a bilateral relationship that more realistically addresses the genuine as opposed to imaginary or exaggerated concerns of the other side while recognizing the very real common reasons to cooperate effectively where needed despite the current downward spiral incentives exist in washington beijing and other capitals to fashion what amounts to a middle path that rejects the self destructive worst case assumptions increasingly evident today along with the unrealistic belief that the relationship can somehow return to the more easily managed cooperative and competitive dynamics of the past finding this middle path requires first serious efforts to put a floor under the current near free fall in relations by minimizing the chances of highly escalatory crises occurring over inadvertent incidents or volatile issues especially in asia this is particularly important given the increasing likelihood of such crises as i have indicated above hence more substantive confidence building and crisis management measures are urgently needed track one and track two discussions have produced some notable successes in this area in recent years but such exchanges have often focused too narrowly on the prevention or successful handling of purely military incidents or accidents especially in the track one arena these undertakings largely ignore or omit the larger and arguably more relevant civilian and civil military political and structural decision making context within which each nation s militaries operate this larger context would be as critical a factor in determining the evolution and outcome of a future serious u s china crisis as would purely military to military interactions the problematic features of the broader decision making context of u s china relations that need to be addressed in a frank and open crisis management dialogue include among other things a destabilizing civilian and military leadership assumptions about the requirements for successful crisis stability and crisis deterrence such as the need to seize the initiative early in a crisis b the use of misleading or vague forms of crisis signaling at all levels c confusion or ignorance in each country with regard to the other side s civil military decision making processes and d misconceptions about the level of control exercised by the other side over an allied third party these critical features have been examined in track two discussions but have apparently not been seriously explored on an official or semi official basis the growing levels of distrust and uncertainty in the relationship make it all the more imperative for the two countries to deal directly with these concerns a first step in this direction should be the formation of a senior level u s china civil military dialogue on crisis avoidance and crisis management using input from relevant track two activities but for such a dialogue to occur both sides will need to step back from the current use of simplistic demonizing slogans and self serving platitudes to characterize the relationship instead they must internalize the reality that under current conditions a serious political military crisis between the united states and china has the potential to escalate to a major military conflagration given this stark fact each side must recognize that the other is not necessarily interested in provoking and manipulating a crisis to achieve a decisive advantage in the relationship and that any effort to do so would likely result in disaster that recognition is essential for the initial good faith effort required to engage in a frank discussion of the potentialities of crisis mismanagement on either side beyond the development of leadership crisis management understandings and skills a serious and sustained senior level crisis management dialogue if undertaken with relatively open minds could also have much broader positive consequences by increasing overall levels of understanding and perhaps even trust between chinese and american leaders such changes in perception would have positive implications for u s china interactions not only in those areas most directly associated with political military crises but in many other areas as well indeed the development of more effective crisis management and confidence building measures could promote efforts to deal more frankly with the major issues of serious contention in the relationship including trade and investment tensions technology development issues military deployments and intentions the threats posed by domestic influence campaigns and even human rights disputes in each of these policy areas greater trust and understanding could facilitate less politicized efforts to discern the actual nature and extent of the differences between the two sides and the possible dimensions of any achievable middle ground understanding this would involve a willingness to seek truth from facts and equally important an acknowledgement that the criticisms of the other side while in many cases greatly exaggerated have some basis in truth a good first step toward a more honest pragmatic description of u s concerns and desires regarding china in the economic arena was recently provided by former senior state department official robert zoellick in a set of remarks given in beijing after describing a range of u s concerns in a nonconfrontational manner he urged his chinese audience not to assume a defensive posture rely on economic autarky or maneuver on a purely tactical level vis à vis the united states 1 the same advice could also be given to u s officials while a serious crisis management dialogue and frank constructive efforts to identify the possible middle ground on specific policy areas of contention can go a long way to placing the u s china relationship on less volatile and more productive footing a more fundamental course correction is necessary for the long term the u s china relationship needs to develop a new strategic narrative one based on a realistic and feasible set of facts and assumptions about the changing capabilities actions and intentions on both sides this is particularly needed in the asia pacific where the sources of serious conflict are most present as i have written in creating a stable asia an agenda for a u s china balance of power beijing and washington must eventually recognize that neither power will dominate this vital region in the future the near inevitable balance of power that will most likely emerge instead must be made stable to avoid the most serious outcomes discussed in this essay 2 this can only happen on the basis of a common appreciation of the huge benefits that will accrue to both countries from a the cultivation of a single integrated asian economic system rather than a set of mutually exclusive and competing sub systems b effective crisis avoidance and management mechanisms and understandings regarding the region s most volatile hotspots and c a more defense oriented less escalatory set of common force postures and military doctrines the strategic logic of such a stable mutually beneficial balance of power will derive from the two nations common need to continue receiving the obvious rewards the increasingly vital region offers a steadily worsening relationship would inevitably put these benefits at risk building some level of trust and understanding between beijing and washington through a serious crisis management dialogue follow on policy discussions and ultimately a new strategic narrative seems inconceivable under current conditions it is possible even likely that leadership on both sides will need to change for real progress to occur but the u s china relationship has become too large too interdependent and too vital to global political and economic stability for the two countries to lapse into a truly hostile relationship the enormity of the potential consequences arising from avoidable errors reflects the reality today the sino american relationship cannot and must not be allowed to rest on the kind of adversarial zero sum views we currently confront a more stable asia much less a more stable overall sino u s relationship will not develop overnight this transformation can only take place over a period of years under the direction of experienced diplomats business leaders and military officers who possess a strong sense of the high stakes involved and a clear understanding of the dangers of allowing the corrosive status quo to continue the result will not be a return to the past model of relations but rather a set of interactions that is more competitive more equally balanced and yet still in many ways cooperative and mutually beneficial although undoubtedly more challenging to maintain than in the past it is essential that both sides embrace and work together to bring about this more stable set of interactions that is the only way to help ensure that the next forty years of the u s china relationship are as mutually beneficial and conflict free despite the many challenges encountered as the previous forty years have been this article was originally written for the carter center s symposium on the 40th anniversary of the establishment of u s china diplomatic relations

household wealth in china declined as a result chinese shoppers are abandoning iphones for cheaper chinese made smartphones buying fewer swiss watches and travelling less many couples have decided against having a second child because of the cost the term consumption downgrade has become popular online as netizens swap advice about how to save money china s slowdown is the result of a government campaign to rein in excessive debt and calm property prices then came the trade war which hasn t had a huge direct effect on the economy but has eliminated the sense of certainty and stability central to business and consumer confidence said scott kennedy of csis in washington what chinese consumers can and cannot spend matters domestic consumption accounted for a little more than three quarters of economic growth last year as manufacturing and trade are hit by the us tariffs the country s policymakers are looking to its citizens to offset those losses consumer spending plays a very important role if it falls the impact on the economy will be large said ye tan an independent economist and analyst based in shanghai in theory spending begets more spending as companies take more orders produce more and workers go home with more money in their pockets according to ye the whole process forms a virtuous cycle and people will have more confidence she said confidence is really important yet confidence is thin on the ground the core areas of chinese consumption property durable goods such as electronics and cars have all seen sharp declines over the past year last year car sales contracted in china the world s largest auto market for the first time since 1990 retail sales in november grew at their weakest rate in 15 years and at least one in five apartments in

shoppers have begun to sound the alarm apple issued its first profit warning since 2002 on the back of slowing demand in china ermenegildo zegna said it would be holding back store expansion in the country one of its largest markets because of the expected downturn there is a need for some other sector to step up and provide leadership of the economy the much hyped chinese consumer should be the

working week to encourage spending city officials in beijing are asking retailers to stay open for longer to foster a night economy property developers have slashed prices while electronics retailers have begun offering discounts on iphones economists say these measures will take time to have any meaningful impact and some analysts expect further stimulus measures to boost the economy others say the structural problems in the chinese economy cannot be fixed so easily turning on the credit spigots alone won t fix the problem said kennedy on a friday afternoon the apple store in the sanlitun shopping district in beijing is full while a nearby store selling huawei phones sits mostly empty a worker at the genius bar says the store is usually even busier that today another store clerk says that while traffic is as much as it usually is there is not the same clamour for new iphones when the latest model came out in october there was no queue outside the store some argue that the idea of

years with net charge offs as a percentage of loans the lowest since 1987 while loan growth did not meet our expectations that subdued growth enabled us to return the excess capital we generated back to our shareholders for the year m t repurchased 2 2 billion of common stock and paid 508 million of common dividends to our shareholders that resulted in a 146 payout ratio for the year the repurchase program resulted in 5 5 decline in average diluted shares for the full year of 2018 when compared with 2017 advertisement advertisement now let s look at the specifics for the fourth quarter diluted gaap earnings per common share were 3 76 for the fourth quarter of 2018 improved from 3 53 in the third quarter of 2018 and 2 01 in the fourth quarter of 2017 net income for the quarter was 546 million compared with 526 million in the linked quarter and 322 million in the year ago quarter on a gaap basis m t s fourth quarter results produced an annualized rate of return on average assets of 1 84 and an annualized return on average common equity of 14 8 this compares with rates of 1 8 and 14 08 respectively in the previous quarter included in the gaap results in the recent quarter were after tax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to 4 million or 0 03 per common share down slightly from the prior quarter consistent with our long term practice m t provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis from which we have only ever excluded the after tax effect of amortization of intangible assets as well as any gains or expenses associated with mergers and acquisitions when they occur m t s net operating income for the fourth quarter which excludes intangible amortization was 550 million compared with 531 million in the linked quarter and 327 million in 2017 s fourth quarter diluted net operating earnings per common share were 3 79 in the recent quarter compared with 3 56 in the third quarter of 2018 and 2 04 in the fourth quarter of 2017 net operating income yielded annualized rates of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders equity of 1 93 and 22 16 in the recent quarter the comparable returns were 1 89 and 21 in the third quarter of 2018 in accordance with the sec s guidelines this morning s press release contains a tabular reconciliation of gaap and non gaap results including tangible assets and equity advertisement advertisement both gaap and net operating earnings for the fourth quarters of 2018 and 2017 were impacted by certain noteworthy items included in the fourth quarter 2018 results was a 20 million contribution to the m t charitable foundation that amounted to 15 million after tax effect or 0 11 per common share also included in 2018 s fourth quarter was a 15 million reduction in m t s provision for income taxes arising from an irs approved change in tax treatment of certain loan fees which was retroactive to 2017 this also amounted to 0 11 per common share included in the fourth quarter of 2017 s results were 21 million of realized gains on investment securities which amounted to 14 million after tax effect or 0 09 per common share also reflected in the fourth quarter 2017 results was a contribution to the m t charitable foundation of 44 million which amounted to 27 million after tax effect or 0 18 per common share m t s effective tax rate for 2017 s fourth quarter was impacted by the changes to the federal corporate income tax rates m t s provision for income taxes for that quarter was increased by approximately 85 million amounting to 0 56 per common share as a result of those tax law changes as a reminder the year over year comparisons for both gaap and net operating earnings were impacted by the reduction in federal corporate income taxes for 2018 turning to the balance sheet and the income statement taxable equivalent net interest income was 1 065 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018 up 30 million from the linked quarter the net interest margin improved to 3 92 up 4 basis points from 3 88 in the linked quarter we estimate that the shorter we estimate that higher short term interest asset interest rates following the fed s september and december rate actions added a benefit to the margin of as much as 6 basis points cash interest received on acquired loans combined with a slightly higher level of prepayment fees added an estimated 2 basis points to the fourth quarter margin the higher average balance of funds placed on deposit with the fed had an estimated 4 basis point dilutive effect on the margin the higher cash balances were primarily the result of increased trust demand deposits and the continued slow pace of reinvestment of cash flows from investment securities average loans increased less than 1 compared with the previous quarter the ongoing run off of residential real estate loans primarily acquired hudson city mortgage loans was more than offset by growth in other loan categories which increased 754 million or 1 1 from the third quarter advertisement advertisement looking at the loans by category on an average basis compared with the linked quarter commercial and industrial loans were about 3 higher than in the prior quarter this included a 275 million seasonal increase in loans to auto dealers to finance their inventories combined with a 411 million increase in other c i loans commercial real estate loans were down less than 1 compared with the third quarter with modest growth in construction loans offset by a lower level of commercial mortgage loans as a result of paydowns and a decline in loans held for sale residential real estate loans which are largely comprised of mortgage loans acquired in the hudson city transaction continued the expected pace of paydowns the portfolio declined about 3 consistent with previous quarters consumer loans were up 2 with growth in indirect auto and recreation finance loans outpacing continuing declines in home equity lines and loans regionally in addition to the multi region seasonal rebound in floor plan lending pennsylvania and our metro region which includes new york city philadelphia and tarrytown realized the strongest growth in c i loans new jersey was the bright spot for cre loans average core customer deposits which exclude deposits received at m ts cayman islands office and cds over 250 000 were up about 4 annualized compared with the third quarter the higher levels of trust demand deposits i mentioned previously were the primary driver of the increase turning to non interest income non interest income totaled 481 million in the fourth quarter compared with 459 million in the prior quarter the quarter s results included 4 million of security valuation gains on our remaining portfolio of gse preferred stock compared with the 3 million loss in the third quarter mortgage banking revenues were 92 million in the recent quarter compared with 88 million in the linked quarter advertisement advertisement residential mortgage loans originated for sale were 412 million in the quarter down about 24 compared with the third quarter a decline in origination revenues was partially offset by higher residential servicing fees attributable to a sub servicing portfolio we on boarded during the third quarter total residential mortgage banking revenues including both origination and servicing activities were 57 million compared with 59 million in the prior quarter commercial mortgage banking revenues were 35 million in the fourth quarter up from 29 million in the linked quarter trust income was 135 million in the recent quarter up slightly from 134 million in the previous quarter and up 4 from 130 million in 2017 s fourth quarter new business generation continues to be strong while the weakness in equity markets during the quarter was a modest headwind service charges on deposit accounts were 109 million essentially unchanged from the prior quarter trading and fx gains were 17 million improved by 11 million from the prior quarter largely reflecting customer interest rate swap activity coming as a result of the improved pace of commercial lending turning to expenses operating expenses for the fourth quarter which exclude the amortization of intangible assets were 797 million as i mentioned earlier the fourth quarter s operating expenses reflected a 20 million contribution to the m t charitable foundation excluding the contribution operating expenses increased by 7 million from 770 million in 2018 s third quarter that increase reflects higher salaries and benefits attributable to one additional working day during the quarter and increased incentive compensation expense arising from last year s solid financial performance the remaining expense categories in aggregate were essentially flat with the prior quarter with the elimination of the fdic s large bank surcharge being partially offset by higher other cost of operations the efficiency ratio which excludes intangible amortization from the numerator and securities gains or losses from the denominator which does include the charitable contribution was 51 7 in the recent quarter increased slightly from 51 4 in the previous quarter the ratio was 54 7 in 2017 s fourth quarter advertisement advertisement next let s turn to credit our credit quality continues to be largely in line with the trends seen over the past few quarters indeed consistent with the trends seen over the past few years annualized net charge offs as a percentage of total loans were 17 basis points for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared with 7 basis points in the third quarter recall that the third quarter s results included a sizable 13 million recovery on a previously charged off cre loan the provision for credit losses was 38 million in the recent quarter essentially matching net charge offs the allowance for credit losses was 1 billion at the end of december and the ratio of the allowance to total loans was 1 15 at the end of 2018 non accrual loans increased by 23 million at december 31 compared with the end of the prior quarter the ratio of non accrual loans to total loans increased by 1 basis point ending the quarter at 1 01 we did see a rise in criticized loans during the quarter primarily driven by a couple of large loans with unique circumstances loans 90 days passed due on which we continue to accrue interest excluding acquired loans that had been marked to a fair value discounted acquisition were 223 million at the end of the quarter of these loans 192 million or 86 are guaranteed by government related entities turning to capital m t s common equity tier 1 ratio was an estimated 10 13 compared with 10 46 at the end of the third quarter the decline reflects retention the decline reflects earnings retention during the fourth quarter share repurchases and the impact of the improved loan growth which in turn led to higher end of period risk weighted assets m t repurchased 500 million of its common stock during the quarter as noted earlier for the full year of 2018 m t repurchased 12 3 million shares of its common stock valued at 2 2 billion and paid 508 million of common dividends to our shareholders this resulted in a 146 payout ratio for the year advertisement advertisement next i d like to take a moment to cover the key highlights of 2018 s full year results gaap based diluted earnings per common share were 12 74 up 46 from 8 70 in 2017 net income was 1 92 billion improved from 1 41 billion in the prior year these results produced returns on average assets and average common equity of 1 64 and 12 82 respectively net operating income which excludes intangible amortization was 1 94 billion improved from 1 43 billion in the prior year diluted net operating income per common share was 12 86 also up 46 from 8 82 in 2017 net operating income for 2018 expressed as a rate of return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders equity was 1 72 and 19 09 respectively we note that the full year improvement in gaap and net operating earnings included a sizable benefit from lower us corporate tax rates however the year over year improvement notwithstanding lower taxes was significant pre tax gaap and net operating income both improved by 8 while diluted common shares outstanding declined by 5 5 as a result of the repurchase activity now turning to the outlook looking forward into 2019 our outlook is fairly consistent with the one we shared on this call last january while gdp growth may slow from the pace seen in 2018 we still expect it to be at a level consistent with the average annual rate of growth seen in the last seen since the last recession ended unemployment remains very low and both consumer and commercial customers financial positions are healthy consumer confidence remains relatively high although commercial customers are slightly more cautious in addition there continues to be measurable progress toward a regulatory approach tailored for banks like m t however with the usual caveat that events never unfold entirely in the manner you expect here are a few thoughts for the upcoming year loans outstanding declined on a full year average basis in 2018 but were up at the end of 2018 by about one half of 1 from the end of 2017 this reflected a 13 decline in residential mortgage loans offset by 4 aggregate growth in the other loan portfolios average total loans for the fourth quarter of 2018 were down about one half of 1 from the fourth quarter of 2017 average with a 13 decline in residential real estate loans offset by aggregate 3 growth in the other portfolios advertisement advertisement while as noted commercial and industrial loan growth in the past quarter was notably stronger than any quarter over the past two years paydowns continue to be a wildcard our pipeline as we enter 2018 2019 is consistent with or perhaps slightly better than it was at this point last year the cre market remains somewhat active most notably in the multifamily and healthcare sectors as was the case in 2018 cre loan growth for the coming year will be dictated by the rate at which existing construction projects are funded demand for new construction financing as well as for permanent financing and construction project as construction projects reach completion we expect continued run off of the residential real estate portfolio likely at a consistent low double digit pace although the dollar amount of the decline will continue to lessen as that portfolio gets smaller and we continue to see attractive pricing and underwriting standards in the consumer area given these trends our expectation for 2019 is that average total loans will grow on a full year basis at a low single digit pace if the improved pace of c i lending that m t experienced in the fourth quarter continues including slower paydowns we could exceed that rate as has been the case since the fed began to raise interest rates in late 2015 our outlook for the net interest margin is dependent on further rate actions a flat scenario should still lead to some expansion of the margin from 3 92 in the fourth quarter as the benefit from last year s september and december fed actions extend over a full calendar year any future rate actions by the fed in 2019 should they occur will potentially offer further moderate upside deposit pricing reactivity remains an area of focus and appears likely to be somewhat higher than in the past as the fed slows or halts its pace of short term rate increases there is a likelihood that deposit pricing pressures will continue for a period of time that outlook excludes the potential impact from cash balances brought in through wilmington trust which usually have an impact on the reported margin but would have a lesser incremental effect on revenue the level of cash on deposit at the fed was higher at year end than the average for the fourth quarter based on the current level of interest rates and reflecting the impact of the interest rate hedges we entered into last year our estimate for a hypothetical future 25 basis point increase in short term interest rates will bring a more modest benefit to the net interest margin than we ve seen previously perhaps in the area of 2 basis points to 4 basis points this embeds a series of assumptions on resultant deposit pricing reactivity based on those balance and margin assumptions we expect year over year growth in net interest income the higher interest rate environment will likely continue to challenge residential mortgage banking in 2018 specifically with respect to residential mortgage loan originations as we ve noted previously we have the capacity and appetite for additional owned msr servicing or sub servicing business this could offer a potential offset to slow originations the outlook for the remaining fee businesses remains consistent with our experience in 2018 with growth in the low single digit range with the exception of trust revenues which have been growing in a mid single digit or better pace excluding the 135 million addition to the litigation reserve from full year 2018 s operating expenses we expect low nominal growth in total operating expenses for 2019 over last year as is our usual practice we budget for modest positive operating leverage based on our revenue outlook this includes the full year benefit approximately 40 million from the elimination of the fdic surcharge we d remind you that we expect our usual seasonal increase in salaries and benefits in the first quarter of 2019 which primarily reflects annual equity incentive compensation as well as a handful of other items last year that increase was approximately 56 million in each of the first quarters of 2017 and 2018 we realized the benefit to our provision for income taxes when prior year equity grants vested at stock prices higher than the price at the grant date at current levels unless there is a meaningful rally in our stock price we wouldn t expect a similar benefit in 2019 s first quarter our outlook for credit remains balanced we just completed our fifth consecutive year of net charge off experience below 20 basis points for each of the past four years we ve cautioned that the trend can t continue and that losses will tick upward although not approaching long term averages i ll reiterate that outlook this year eventually i ll get this right there continue to be some modest pressures on nonperforming and criticized loans but there are no apparent weaknesses in particular industries or geographies regarding taxes our outlook for the effective tax rate for 2018 in the range of 25 to 26 prove to be conservative an approximate rate of 25 is more appropriate for 2019 unless some discrete items occur during the coming year as to capital while the fed implements its amended capital and stress testing rules for banks of our size we ll continue to execute our 2018 capital plan through the end of this year second quarter we expect final rules from the fed in time for our 2019 capital plan we expect to continue to manage our capital levels toward the lower end of our peer group as we believe our consistent approach to underwriting credit and the resultant low earnings volatility argues for maintaining our capital levels toward the lower end of that range maintained by our peers of course as you re aware our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth changes in interest rates political events and other macroeconomic factors which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future now let s open the call to questions before which laurie will briefly review the instructions questions and answers operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of ken zerbe of morgan stanley ken zerbe morgan stanley analyst great thanks good morning darren j king chief financial officer good morning ken ken zerbe morgan stanley analyst i guess maybe just starting off in terms of the very strong growth that we saw in c i lending this quarter presumably some of that is seasonal like the auto dealer piece that you mentioned but when you think about like going into 2019 or even where we stand today is the environment changing is the dialog with borrowers getting meaningfully better or is there something particularly unusual with this quarter that may slow in future quarters thanks darren j king chief financial officer sure so there was normal seasonal uptick in our auto floor plan balances which we have talked about on the third quarter call that also benefited from a couple of large relationships that we on boarded during the quarter so we d expect that number to stay around where it is at least for the first two quarters of the year when we look outside of floor plan and we look at other c i lending we typically see a little bit more activity in the fourth quarter than we do in the other quarters because year end tends to drive things to completion but when we look across industries and we look across geographies it was broad based the uptick which for us was encouraging and that it wasn t one sector or one geography driving the growth and so i think there is i would say there s comfort from our customers perspective in the economy but still a little bit of trepidation and we re hopeful that the dialog that we saw in the fourth quarter continues into the first and second and through the year but i guess it remains to be seen it s tough to draw conclusions off of just one quarter as we look underneath we continue to see solid activity as it regards to pay offs and paydowns and so it was really new originations that drove a lot of the a lot of the growth in the quarter and as we enter 2019 the pipelines are reasonably consistent maybe even slightly above where they were last year so we re guardedly optimistic about c i in 2019 ken zerbe morgan stanley analyst all right great and then just other question i had in terms of the trust demand deposits obviously the non interest bearing grew quite a bit this quarter which is great how sustainable are those or what s the typical pattern if there is a typical pattern for those thanks darren j king chief financial officer sure so you re right trust demand deposits were up sizeably in the fourth quarter we often see a little seasonality in those balances as well toward the end of the year at least we ve seen we saw that i think two years ago many of those will leave the balance sheet in the first quarter those tend to fluctuate depending on market activity that s going on so we expect those will be down closer to the levels that we saw in the third and second quarters of 2018 as we enter the first half of 2019 ken zerbe morgan stanley analyst okay perfect thank you very much operator your next question comes on line of john pancari of evercore isi john pancari evercore isi analyst good morning darren j king chief financial officer good morning john john pancari evercore isi analyst on the back to loan growth regarding the fourth quarter trends how much of a impact did you see in the quarter on the commercial side from the capital markets drying up a bit in december and then separately just trying to think about how to model out that commercial growth would you say that 6 end of period year over year growth that you saw in the commercial is something that could tail off a little bit from that and is that baked into your guidance or could it be back toward the low single digit range thanks darren j king chief financial officer so when we look at c i in the fourth quarter i guess starting with the question about the capital markets we did see a little bit of a freeze up in some of the capital markets activity but it didn t seem to affect our pay off and paydown levels in the fourth quarter so my take on that is that many of the funds that are supplying credit that are non banks still had money and they were still lending and that any of the activity that was going on would ve been new money that would have gone into the funds that isn t yet spoken for except that the larger end of the customer range which is typically above where we would compete when we look at the growth in the fourth quarter as i mentioned there always is a little bit of extra activity that seems to happen in the fourth quarter so 6 to me feels really high and we re not anticipating that rate of growth would continue in 2019 we expect that to come down we also expect to see some balances come off the balance sheet in the first half of the year and so we re a little bit more moderated on our outlook for commercial balance growth in the year closer to kind of the low single digit growth that we ve been talking about all the way long john pancari evercore isi analyst got it okay that s helpful and then separately on the operating leverage side i know you indicated that you still expect operating leverage for 2019 we saw i guess on what we view as a core basis maybe 350 basis points to 400 basis points positive operating leverage for 2018 what type of what magnitude of leverage do you think we could see as you look at 2019 darren j king chief financial officer so when we talk about operating leverage i guess it s important to make sure that we re all on the same page and what we re talking about and seeing so when we talk about modest positive operating leverage we exclude from the year over year calculations the 135 million that we added to the litigation reserve in 2018 s first quarter if you re looking on a gaap basis then expenses will be down but when you factor that out which we do then we expect some modest expense growth even factoring in the fdic but we expect revenue growth to be slightly above that and so we ll expect some modest operating leverage obviously depending on rates that could be hot more or less but based on this we look forward right now we think it s slightly positive john pancari evercore isi analyst okay got it thank you operator your next question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos of j p morgan steven alexopoulos jp morgan analyst hey good morning darren darren j king chief financial officer good morning steven alexopoulos jp morgan analyst i want to start on the nim so it s pretty clear you guys will benefit in the first quarter from the december hike but given your comments for december deposit pressures to persist the fed does go on hold how do you think nim progresses for the rest of the year darren j king chief financial officer so as we look forward alex we think the first quarter nim gets a little bit of benefit as we mentioned before from the full impact of the hike in december and then you ve got to remember i guess there s a couple of things we expect some of the cash balances to come down so those impact the margin and will impact it positively as well as the day count in the first quarter also helps the margin so with those three factors we re expecting an increase in the margin in the first quarter from there when we look forward with no further actions by the fed we would expect to kind of be within a couple of basis points plus or minus of where we end the first quarter through the rest of the year and then the question is obviously how the market reacts from a deposit pricing perspective in absence of any fed increases typically deposit pricing continues for a little bit after the fed stops and so we re anticipating some of that the caveat which i think is a little bit different is for many banks they ve got excess securities balances that we can look to given the change in lcr that we anticipate from new regulations and always a question is how loan growth behaves and if it continues like the fourth quarter for everyone and probably be a little more deposit pricing pressure if it comes back to where we have seen in the first three quarters of the year then there s probably a little bit less pressure so i know that gives you lots of things to think about and a lot of things that are on our mind so it s not exactly a straightforward question steven alexopoulos jp morgan analyst that certainly helps and then regarding the strong growth in c i quite a few other banks are pointing to their customers using their cash balances right to fund expansion too can you give us a sense if we put the impact from the trust related deposits aside like what did you see in non interest bearing deposits this quarter thanks darren j king chief financial officer yes so if you hold trust demand to the side our non interest bearing for the quarter was flat to maybe slightly down and if you look underneath there is some seasonality in non interest bearing balances that we see at m t because of the commercial the magnitude of the commercial non interest bearing that we hold and typically the commercial customers will hold deposits through the end of the year and into january in anticipation of making distributions to their principals and paying taxes so we also typically see a little bit of an outflow of non interest bearing in the first quarter in the commercial side for those reasons and then they slowly grow over the course of the year so outside of trust we re actually encouraged by the non interest bearing that we saw in the fourth quarter steven alexopoulos jp morgan analyst okay but are you also seeing customers use non interest bearing deposits to fund expansion darren j king chief financial officer yes we re seeing some of that we re also seeing them use their lines as a way to fund growth as well i guess my take on it is the behaviors they ve got the line and rates are still relatively low so they ll fund something on the line and then make a decision about making it into more permanent term debt or using their cash to eliminate it and so we re seeing a little bit but not a ton of use of the cash to invest we ve seen more if we see cash flowing out of accounts it tends to be going from non interest bearing into interest bearing accounts either on balance sheet or off steven alexopoulos jp morgan analyst okay great thanks for all the color operator your next question comes from the line of julian wellesley of loomis sayles julian wellesley loomis sayles co analyst hi i have a question about middle market lending competition in the past you ve talked about frothiness in this area in terms of spreads or terms and conditions how are you seeing things now darren j king chief financial officer i don t think we ve seen a material decrease in the competitiveness of the lending environment i think we saw as an industry in the fourth quarter a couple of things i think we saw a lot of activity that was pent up that was trying to get done by the end of the year as well as maybe a slight pause in the non bank markets but as i mentioned before we didn t see a material slowdown in payoffs and paydowns pricing had been dropping when we look at our pricing and spreads for the last couple of quarters they seemed to have leveled off so our take on that is that it was the impact of the tax reform kind of working its way through pricing and it seems to have stabilized and really when we see changes we were seeing we continue to see covenant light things out there if we see things on structure we re seeing longer interest only periods and maybe slight moves up in ltvs but it was minor so from our perspective the fourth quarter it didn t get worse but it didn t really get better julian wellesley loomis sayles co analyst okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of erika najarian of bank of america erika najarian bofa merrill lynch analyst hi good morning i wanted to ask darren a little bit more about the flexibility on the securities portfolio if you didn t have to adhere to lcr i m wondering if you could help us understand what the potential yield benefit would be or would you shrink your balance sheet and that would still be spread accretive darren j king chief financial officer so within the securities portfolio i think if you look at what our securities portfolio is today it s still higher than where we were before liquidity coverage ratio became a requirement and so we would never take that down to zero because we do want that liquidity but there is an option to look at that as one source to fund loan growth and given the spreads that here ph on securities versus the spreads on loans shifting that mix would be a positive for our margin if you look at what we ve been doing with that book over the last few quarters as longer dated mortgage backed securities have paid down we ve held that money in cash or invested it in shorter term treasuries just given where the rate environment has been but we look we don t have a specific plan for that portfolio this year per se but we consider it among our options versus overnight funding versus broker deposits versus bank debt and obviously customer deposit growth as an avenue to fund loan growth and we re always thinking about the impact on the duration of the balance sheet as well as the cost of funds as we consider all those options erika najarian bofa merrill lynch analyst thank you for that and just as a follow up as we think about the revenue outlook for 2019 if somehow it falls a little short of your budget is there flex in your expense outlook or expense budget to be able to create positive operating leverage even if the revenue outlook is a little bit softer than what we re expecting today darren j king chief financial officer sure good question i think the positive operating leverage comment there s a number of things that could impact that the biggest one is what happens with rates with the fed and if they turn from raising to decline if rates stay flat then we should be ok on positive operating leverage but to answer the question there is some flex in our expenses it doesn t happen it doesn t turn on a dime but over the course of a couple of quarters there are things that we have an ability to do to manage the pace of the expense growth but we re going to balance that off against the investments that we re making for the long term of the bank and if we have to sacrifice a little bit of operating leverage in the short term to make the investments we need to for the bank for the future we re not going to worry about that too much erika najarian bofa merrill lynch analyst got it and just one last question on the deposit repricing delay how many quarters typically does it take after the last fed rate hike in terms of the repricing for the repricing to cease or significantly die down darren j king chief financial officer well if you use the past as an indication of the future it s usually two to three quarters that can continue but it also depends on what the reactivity has been up to that point and so there s a lot of things that go into that and then the other question of course is how much loan demand is there and need for those funds so that s kind of what we ve seen in the past i think there s reason to believe that there are a couple of differences one positive and one negative to that history in the current environment but that s kind of what we ve seen in the past erika najarian bofa merrill lynch analyst got it thank you operator your next question comes from the line of peter winter of wedbush peter winter wedbush securities inc analyst good morning darren darren j king chief financial officer good morning peter peter winter wedbush securities inc analyst i wanted to ask about credit quality obviously it s very strong but you ve got nonperforming assets that increased a little bit two quarters in a row you mentioned the criticized loans increasing i m just wondering if you can just give a little bit of color there and then secondly with the outlook for better loan growth next year or 2019 would you expect to start adding to reserves darren j king chief financial officer sure so i guess i started at the high level and look at delinquency and where delinquency trends have been we haven t seen anything that gives us cause for concern in any of the books we ve seen a little bit of an increase as you noted in year end in non performers and the allowance actually the allowance is pretty flat in non performers and when we look under the covers of what s going on there we continue to not really see any particular industry as it relates to c i any particular class of real estate as it relates to cre any particular geography from a consumer perspective that causes us concern now that said we re m t and we re paranoid so we re going back through the book again to see if there s anything that we re missing but generally as we ve gone through the non performers there are also a couple of larger non performers and a couple of larger criticized that i mentioned before that are very specific situations so we re comfortable with where things are but we re m t so we re paranoid peter winter wedbush securities inc analyst okay and then just the possibly adding to reserves with a better outlook for loan growth this year darren j king chief financial officer yes i mean obviously we go through our allowance every quarter and we ve got a process that we follow every quarter looking at the grades of our loans and the charge off rates and obviously we have a little higher loan growth it would be reasonable to expect that the provision would go up with it peter winter wedbush securities inc analyst got it thanks darren operator your next question comes from the line of geoffrey elliott of autonomous research geoffrey elliott autonomous research llp analyst hello thanks for taking the question another one on those criticized loans can you give us a bit more of a sense of the magnitude of the increase just give us a feel for how significant or not significant it is and then anything on the industries the types of loans any kind of color around those that would be helpful thanks darren j king chief financial officer sure it s going to be a couple of 100 million increase in the quarter compared to third quarter and within there there s two or three large loans over 50 million that we ve got our eye on and it s a variety of industries and various different reasons why in one case we ve got a company that has a debt service coverage ratio that got a little close to our trigger but when we look at that company and we look through its income statement and we work with them we can see that they have opportunities to change their expense profile and rectify that situation when we look at another one we see some excessive leverage that was helped by some of the non bank financials so there s a story to each one and there are paths for them to not remain on that criticized list but because we re doing our work and we re watching what s going on we put them on that list to make sure that we pay attention to it and try to keep them from becoming defaults geoffrey elliott autonomous research llp analyst understood thanks very much operator your next question comes from the line of frank schiraldi of sandler o neill frank schiraldi sandler o neill analyst good morning darren j king chief financial officer good morning frank schiraldi sandler o neill analyst just one question just on the this might be splitting hairs darren but just in terms of the december rate hike that we already got you talked about 2 basis points to 4 basis points of benefit and if we get any additional rate hikes perhaps in 2019 and in the past you guys talked about 5 bps to 8 bps i think of benefit so i was just wondering does the december rate hike the benefit you are likely to get in the first quarter from it is that somewhere in between or is the 2 bps to 4 bps a good number to use there darren j king chief financial officer that s not a bad number to use because we have gotten some benefit of it already right and we talked about 5 bps to 8 bps before so that s probably a good number to use frank schiraldi sandler o neill analyst okay great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy of rbc gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst hi darren how are you darren j king chief financial officer good how are you gerard gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst good thank you on your c i loan growth that you saw this quarter when you look at it what percentage of it came from existing customers versus new customers that you won in the quarter darren j king chief financial officer that s a great question if we look at our loan book we generally get the majority of our loan growth from our existing customers just because on a percentage basis off the portfolio that s where a lot of the growth comes from we did see some new customer ads particularly in new jersey we noted new jersey is a strong growth market i ll remind everyone once again that it continues to be basically a de novo so it s off a small base but it was a really nice ad in terms of what we refer to as prospect conversions in the quarter but when you look in aggregate the bulk tends to come from the existing customer base gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst very good and then speaking of new jersey i think you said in your opening remarks you saw some good commercial real estate loan growth in new jersey was that construction or mortgage commercial real estate term mortgage and just what types of properties were you able to finance darren j king chief financial officer so i don t have the specifics for new jersey on those ones gerard but the trend we saw in the quarter and have seen for much of the years activity in multifamily and in hotel space so i would expect that in new jersey we saw some of that but just given our presence in new jersey and the fact that we re growing i think it s a little bit broader than we would see some permanent mortgage business there as well gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst and then lastly obviously m t has always distinguished itself on your ability to manage your capital very effectively granted the post financial crisis has changed that a bit but once you come out of ccar what are the advantages that you guys are thinking you re going to have in terms of managing your capital once you don t have to go through the annual ccar test darren j king chief financial officer so we re still waiting for final word on what all of this is going to mean both in terms of what the process is with the regulators as well as whether the new stress capital buffer framework comes into effect i guess what we re hopeful for is that we start to end up in a place a little bit like the lcr or where the lcr seems to be evolving and that it s part of your normal supervisory process that you re reviewing your position with the regulators but then you have a little bit more flexibility to manage that part of the balance sheet without some of the specifics of what you can do and how much you can do in any given time period and i think we just look for the ability to be able to deploy our shareholders capital either into customer growth if they need support and we want to be there to provide lending to help them grow their businesses and when they re not able to do that we want to be able to take that capital that we can t put to use in the business and return to the shareholders and kind of not have as many restrictions on how much we can return in any quarter that we can be a little bit more dynamic in how we manage the balance sheet gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of matt o connor of deutsche bank matthew o connor deutsche bank ag analyst hi good morning darren j king chief financial officer good morning matthew o connor deutsche bank ag analyst just wondering if you could talk about how other bank ceos are thinking about the stocks the environment obviously you have a lot of capital you have been acquirer in the past i m just wondering if the sell off in the stocks and risk assets in general and increased macro concerns may be bringing some people to the table or thinking a little bit differently than say three or six months ago darren j king chief financial officer so i guess i haven t spent a lot of time with other bank ceos to know exactly what they re thinking but when you look at the market and what s happened with bank stocks and with multiples the whole industry is rerated down basically together i think we had a better december than some others did but we re still all relatively down so for someone to think about selling or for acquisition math to work it s about the difference between the buyer and the seller in some cases and the relative differences hasn t changed from what it was a few months ago and i don t think we ve heard too much where people are capitulating and thinking that the world is coming to an end and it s time to sell my bank matthew o connor deutsche bank ag analyst okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of christopher spahr of wells fargo christopher spahr wells fargo securities llc analyst hi thank you the trading line item a pretty good pick up quarter over quarter actually compared to actually the last few years on a quarterly basis and you attributed to pick up in c i lending given your commentary on c i lending going forward or just loan growth going forward do you think that trading levels sustainable or we kind of revert back to what we ve seen in the last few years in trading darren j king chief financial officer yes the trading tends to go in lockstep with originations and it s not just c i lending originations that happened to have a big impact on the balance sheet this quarter but originations continued in the quarter on both cre and c i and both of those sectors will use swaps to manage their interest rate risk and so the trading account should move in lockstep with loan origination activity and so as that moves up or down the trading revenue should move up or down as well christopher spahr wells fargo securities llc analyst and just as a follow up the other commentary on fee revenues excluding kind of the trust if that takes into account kind of that kind of outlook correct darren j king chief financial officer yes christopher spahr wells fargo securities llc analyst all right thank you operator your final question comes from the line of brian klock of keefe bruyette woods brian klock keefe bruyette woods analyst hey good morning darren darren j king chief financial officer good morning brian brian klock keefe bruyette woods analyst so i wanted to kind of follow up on maybe you had a discussion earlier about some of the lcr and sort of thoughts going forward in managing your liquidity i guess looking at page 14 in your press release and the year over year 18 versus 17 the securities portfolio has come down quite a bit since 2017 darren j king chief financial officer yes brian klock keefe bruyette woods analyst and just thinking about it s now on an end of period basis at the end of the year it s even below the fourth quarter average of 13 billion so i know you ve had deposit run off to some hudson city time deposits et cetera i guess how do you think about that level of the securities portfolio in 2018 do you think this is i guess you guys have used this just with other hedging and other telco strategies but this is an area where this will grow from here or this where do you think it might stabilize at on the security side darren j king chief financial officer sure so on that page brian when we look at securities and the portfolio we look at it in combination with the top line there interest bearing deposits at banks or cash the fed and when we have been seeing payoffs and paydowns of the securities portfolio depending on where rates were we ve been holding some of that in cash because the rate we re getting in cash is within 10 basis points or 15 basis points of what you could get at one year treasury and within our securities portfolio we ve kind of had a bit of a barbell if you will between at mortgage backed securities being kind of longer dated for rate and then the shorter end to manage duration and so we ve been just allowing some of the securities portfolio to go into cash and that s why you see some of those cash balances increasing some of it was absolutely because of growth in trust demand but some of it is also just shifting between securities and cash and so if you look at the combined they are down a little bit but it s not as quite as dramatic as what the securities might look like on its own brian klock keefe bruyette woods analyst got it so if i think about average earning assets in 19 versus 18 so that anything outside of loans whether it s the interest bearing deposits fed fund security that s going to be around 19 billion on average which it seems like it s been the last two years so the earning asset growth could be higher than whatever you put into loan growth will grow your earning assets from the 106 8 million ph that you had for 2018 darren j king chief financial officer maybe maybe not you could see switch between categories right you could see just within the loan book switch between mortgage versus the other categories because of that continued run down and then within the asset on the asset side of the balance sheet between securities and loan so aggregate earning asset growth might be flat to slightly down depending on how we choose to fund some of the loan growth brian klock keefe bruyette woods analyst okay and just a real follow up quick follow up question on the fee income guidance so when you talked about trust being mid single digit because there s good momentum in that business so with the mortgage banking be included with all the other in that low single digit guide or is mortgage banking expected to be a little softer because of some of the headwinds on originations darren j king chief financial officer it s included with everything else brian klock keefe bruyette woods analyst okay thanks for your time darren darren j king chief financial officer sure brian operator thank you i ll

and happy new year we ll start on slide 5 4 i m sorry with the presenters and you ll see one change in our lineup this quarter mike naatz is going to be speaking to the sales and marketing and revenue side of the business in the presentation we will have jose zozaya on the phone in mexico and brian hancock is here in the room with this for q a moving to slide 5 fourth quarter results revenue increased 5 to a record for the fourth quarter 694 million led by strength in crude oil and refined products into mexico volumes were flat from the previous year fourth quarter operating ratio is 63 1 adjusted operating ratio of 64 3 mike upchurch will get into details about the adjustment but basically as it relates to insurance recoveries from the hurricane harvey flooding in 2017 fourth quarter earnings per share of 1 59 adjusted earnings per share of 1 56 which was a record for the fourth quarter and 13 improvement over last year slide 6 we talk about the full year results revenue increased 5 from 2017 to a record 2 714 million 2 volume growth full year operating ratio reported of 63 7 again the adjustment takes that 64 3 with the adjustment primarily being the insurance recoveries that i mentioned a minute ago full year eps of 6 13 adjusted to 597 which was also a record and a 14 increase from 2017 slide 7 probably the most interesting slide in the presentation today we have finished our full year 2019 plan and long range plan update and keeping with our commitment that we made in november of sharing being a little more forthcoming with guidance this is where we ended up when we finished our planning process for 2019 we re looking at volume growth in the 3 to 4 range revenue growth of 5 to 7 for 2019 and we re putting a longer term operating ratio target out there of 60 to 61 by 2021 jeff will talk more about that you mentioned and we saw in the press release we mentioned a heightened focus on operational excellence and operational performance and implementation of some of the principles of precision schedule railroading jeff will get into that in more detail in a few minutes i ll just say that we are in a very early stages of our works and understanding how psr principles will apply and we will probably not be completing in terms of answering some questions about timing and magnitude of some of the details again we re very early in our thinking here so further guidance here earnings per share over the next three years low to mid teen compound annual growth rate in eps and capex for 2019 we re looking at the 640 million to 660 million range 660 million which includes some locomotive purchases that we ve talked about in previous reports and then beyond 2019 we are looking to capex migrating down to something in the high teens but below 20 so with that i will turn the presentation over to jeff jeffrey m songer executive vice president and chief operating officer thanks pat and good morning starting with review of operating metrics for the quarter on slide 9 overall dwell and velocity showed general improvement over q3 peak third quarter congestion eased in december and january year to date metrics continue to show improvement coming out of our normal holiday slowdown period last week s reported dwell has returned to normal levels at 22 5 hours expanding on the current state of operations on slide 10 other key metrics showing substantial improvement or the terminal performance at monterrey and sanchez inventory and dwell at these terminals have significantly improved since peak levels in the third quarter we continue to work with customers to rightsize equipment and optimize service in this region cross border initiatives continue to support fluidity in the region and q4 was another strong quarter for cross border volume that increased by 16 we continue to progress our international crew initiatives and are seeing a reduction in overall transit time across the bridge as more trains operate with this crew base turning to slide 11 i will provide a quick update on capital spend 2018 capital was 19 of revenue or 5 below guidance reductions attributed primarily to cost savings and ptc and other capacity projects coming in the low budget highlights for 2019 capital include continued investment in cross border line of road capacity and infrastructure improvements to support the growth in this region segments between houston and the border as well as monterrey to matamoros continue to be a priority to support strong cross border demand and new refined products terminal coming online in houston and gulf regions additionally we are on track to receive the first of 50 new high horsepower locomotives units late in january as mentioned last quarter we are selling 33 lower horsepower units as part of this transaction i will provide additional color on our locomotive fleet momentarily turning to slide 12 i would like to provide some insight into our plans for psr entering 2019 we are focused on implementing the psr operating principles that are most relevant to our network to assist in this process we have entered into a consulting agreement with sameh fahmy mr fahmy is a former canadian national executive with 27 years of experience at cn 12 of those years spent working as part of hunter harrison s executive management team in addition to his experience with cn mr fahmy has done work with other railroads in similar psr roles he also brings a wealth of locomotive knowledge as he worked with ge for 3 years initial areas of focus include improved labor and asset utilization train start rationalization and fueling efficiency among several others mr fahmy s compensation structure is in line with that of our executive management team and we are all working toward shared financial goals providing some real life examples of recent initiatives we have redesigned our intermodal and manifest product between kansas city and st louis and have reduced eight train starts per week in this segment initial rationalization of our mexico network has provided an additional 28 train start per week production combined these two initiatives will save over 2 million per year and labor cost alone in addition to locomotive fuel and equipment savings turning back to our locomotive strategy psr initiatives will allow us to reduce the overall locomotive fleet while we have not identified a total number for reduction at this time as compared to the peak number of active locomotives in 2018 we have returned 25 leased units and are in process of storing an additional 20 units acquisition of the 50 new units is in line with another of our psr initiatives of reducing locomotive failures new reliable units will allow for increased fleet utilization by reducing unplanned failures at the same time this acquisition provides additional high horsepower units to support the growth in our refined products unit train segment we will continue to target other yard local and poor performing road units for disposition nothing about our network should prevent implementing parts of psr that will help drive efficiencies and we will continue to work closely with interchange partners who are also at work on psr initiatives in the end we look to see more efficient interchanges from overall rail network improvements i will now turn the presentation over to mike naatz michael j naatz executive vice president chief marketing officer thank you jeff and good morning everyone i ll start my comments on page 14 you ll see the fourth quarter year over year revenue was up 5 on flat volumes if you were to look at the appendix you see full year revenue and volume growth we re at 5 and 2 respectively in the fourth quarter we continue to see strong growth in cross border carloads and revenue most notably from refined products and cross border intermodal business however as jeff discussed during the first half of q4 we were challenged by congestion in northern mexico and this did have an impact on our business during the quarter our revenue per unit grew consistently with what we experienced in q3 despite mixed pressure from the lots of some long haul utility coal business and unfavorable fx core pricing environment remained healthy and we expect pricing to outpace inflation the chemical and petroleum business unit recorded revenue growth of 19 this growth was primarily driven by strong southbound volumes of refined fuel products moving into mexico for the full year the mexican energy reform business contributed nearly 100 million of revenue with carloads and revenue growing at 156 and 120 respectively we included a full year recap on this topic in the appendix it s also worth mentioning that plastics grew at 14 revenue from our industrial and consumer business unit was down 5 year over year this decrease was primarily attributable to timing of military moves a shift in a customer sourcing location within our metals business which in turn significantly reduce the length of haul on those moves and then the previously mentioned congestion at the border revenue in our ag and min business grew at 8 in the fourth quarter this growth was driven primarily by our grain business due to improvements in cycle times and we did see positive pricing gain the energy units revenue decline of 7 was driven by a previously announced closure of a power generation facility in texas and by continuing declines in frac sand these declines were partially offset by higher volume and pricing in our crude oil business driven largely by canadian crude shipments intermodal revenue increased slightly year over year with mixed performance by lane the cross border franchise revenue growth was solid at 8 driven by truck to rail conversions other domestic lanes were challenged by congestion and tougher year over year comps additionally while lazaro intermodal volumes declined 5 year over year we did see meaningful sequential improvement in this lane driven by our actions taken to restore lazaro cardenas volumes revenue from the automotive business was down slightly over the prior year border congestion unplanned plant shutdowns and continued equipment availability issues in north america impacted this business unit now i d now like to move on to slide 15 where we provide a business segment outlook for 2019 as pat mentioned our full year volume outlook is approximately 3 to 4 with a 5 to 7 year over year revenue growth projection starting with the chemical and petroleum business the mexico energy reform continues to be a significant focus and unique opportunity for kcs we expect volume growth from refined products to continue next year as demand increases and storage capacity comes online we expect plastics to grow in 2019 with increased demand additionally heavy fuel oil shipments in mexico are also expected to grow along with higher production we expect to see solid performance in the automotive business even though certain plant closures were unexpectedly elongated following the holidays we expect volume to grow slightly ahead of most third party estimates for mexico production in addition to increasing production in mexico volume growth may benefit from market share gains using congestion and additional equipment we expect to see continued but moderated growth in our intermodal business our cross border and us domestic business has started slowly but we expect to benefit from truck to rail conversions tight truck capacity and expanded capacity at some key intermodal terminals as mentioned earlier we expect to see positive sequential trends in our lazaro business as additional trucking regulations are implemented in mexico and as our customers continue to evaluate and take advantage of our short term volume based pricing strategy however we are taking a pragmatic approach to the business focusing on strong service product and rational pricing we believe that this focus will help us deliver future volume growth that is both sustainable and in the best interest of our customers and shareholders as for energy our coal business should grow with higher natural gas prices and increased demand in the texas market on the crude side of things we are monitoring developments around mandatory production cuts by the canadian government and the corresponding potential implications on our canadian crude business additionally we expect continued declines in frac sand due to sourcing pattern changes and lastly our outlook for industrial and consumer and the ag and min business is neutral to slightly positive although our metals business should improve in 2019 due to capacity expansions and improved cycle times we are watching the impact of changes to the global trading patterns and tariffs very closely and with that i ll turn things over to cfo mike upchurch michael w upchurch executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks mike and good morning everyone let me start my remarks with a summary overview of fourth quarter 2018 results revenues of 694 million were up 5 primarily due to higher fuel surcharge revenues reported operating ratio improved to 63 1 predominantly due to an 8 5 million insurance recovery related to hurricane harvey on an adjusted basis excluding the positive impact from the insurance recovery our operating ratio was 64 3 slightly worse than 2017 reported diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 1 59 down from 5 33 in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to the one time benefits we recorded as a result of tax reform adjusted diluted earnings per share of 1 56 was 13 better than fourth quarter 2017 our adjusted effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 28 3 and for the full year 2018 28 9 in line with our guidance of 29 for 2019 through 2021 we are estimating an adjusted effective tax rate of 29 to 30 and from a cash tax standpoint we would expect 2019 to be approximately 17 and for 2020 and 2021 23 and you ll find more details on our tax rates that have been included in the appendix on page 31 turning to operating expenses operating expenses in the quarter adjusted for the insurance recovery from our hurricane harvey claim increased 6 depreciation expense increased 10 million a result of in servicing ptc assets and from a general increase in our asset base fuel prices increased both in the us and in mexico driving up fuel expense by 10 million equipment costs were down 6 million driven by lower lease payments from owning more of our equipment and lower car hire purchased services were up 4 million due to slightly higher it joint facility dredging and security costs we also experienced higher personal injury costs in the quarter due to changes in estimates from an actuarial study and experienced a large derailment early in the quarter in mexico wage and benefit inflation and higher headcount of 4 million and 3 million respectively was partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs of 3 million finally fx lowered overall expense by 5 million i d also like to provide you a few thoughts around 2019 expense levels first we expect compensation and benefits to increase about 5 due to wage and benefit inflation and slightly higher headcount but as jeff mentioned earlier we also expect to produce labor efficiencies based on our early psr work excluding the credit for insurance settlement contained in materials and other we would expect to mno expense and purchased services have normal inflationary type expense increases in 2019 we ve also included estimated fuel prices for 2019 in the appendix on slide 25 and we currently believe fuel prices will moderate in the u s but increase in mexico and we do expect to continue to be eligible for the fuel excise tax credit in 2019 which we estimate to be 35 million to 40 million we expect our equipment expenses to be down slightly as a result of owning more of our equipment and from better cycle times depreciation is expected to increase approximately 9 and is inclusive of ptc depreciation headwinds of 13 million in total we will see ptc expense increases of approximately 17 million for the full year 2019 finally let me cover some of our capital structure and capital allocation priorities as jeff mentioned earlier capex of 512 million for 2018 did come in substantially below our original and revised third quarter guidance we will continue to ensure capital spend in a prudent manner to support our growth while 2019 capital will increase due to purchasing 50 new locomotives we would expect capital expenditures to decline both in 2020 and 2021 to level slightly below 20 of revenue we continue to repurchase our stock under the 800 million stock repurchase plan approved by our board in august of 2017 in the quarter we repurchased 80 million of our common stock which was approximately 50 ahead of our prior quarterly pace cumulatively we have now repurchased approximately 1 billion of our stock and finally in october s p recognized our improvement in the capital structure and upgraded our credit rating to bbb flat and with that i ll turn the call back to pat patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer okay since that maybe a record in terms of finishing our formal comments i ll just make a couple of closing remarks before we open it up to questions i ll refer to the statement quote actually in the press release about the results the quarter the year obviously not a not a bad quarter not a bad year and record performance in a number of levels but as i said in the press release while we delivered record revenues adjusted operating income and adjusted eps 2018 did not meet our own expectations for financial and operational performance in addition we did not meet the expectations of our customers or shareowners particularly in the areas of customer service and growth so while we feel good about the performance and we know we re not altogether pleased because we know we could have done better the key points i think from the presentation and happy to get into the q a the service recovery particularly around the border where we ve experienced the worst congestion over the past few few quarters is well under way and we feel good about the performance of the railroad as we head into the new year the growth opportunities the over sized growth opportunities that we ve been talking about for several of the last few quarters are real and we feel that we ve got pretty good transparency on a number of those opportunities and still feel very positive about the growth outlook and the precision railroading initiative i think is off to a good start i ve been very pleased with the engagement of the team both in the u s and mexico and with the help of sameh i think we can prioritize some things that will give us some pretty quick performance improvement areas and help us deliver the kind of service that we want to on a sustained basis so with that i will open the microphone for questions questions and answers operator thank you we ll now begin the question and answer session operator instructions the first question today is coming from the line of justin long with stephens please proceed with your question justin long stephens analyst thanks and good morning patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer good morning justin justin long stephens analyst so i wanted to start with a question on the or guidance for 2021 and i wanted to see if there was any color you could provide on the cadence of margin improvement that you re expecting over the next three years is it going to be a consistent pace or more front end loaded and then along those lines how much of this improvement is a function of psr implementation versus operating leverage in the business with volume growth michael w upchurch executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah justin this is mike let me take a quick stab at that you know obviously the guidance implies somewhere around 100 to 150 basis point improvement in or we think we still have one major headwind going into 2019 and those are the incremental ptc expenses which are about 17 million we re very early in the process here of identifying initiatives to reduce expenses so i would probably guide you to maybe an acceleration as we get into 20 and 21 and you get the full year benefit of some of those initiatives so hopefully that helps justin long stephens analyst that does and also wanted to ask about the headcount assumption that s embedded in that long term guidance i think you said this year up slightly but how do you expect headcount to trend in 2020 and 2021 patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer well i think with volume growth that we re expecting this year we would typically see a little bit of increase in variable headcount to move that traffic but again i think jeff mentioned it and i made a comment on it we would expect to continue to gain labor efficiencies jeff gave some pretty good examples and we re just so early in the process that we re not really fully baking in all of those potential opportunities we ll continue to do that as we move throughout the process but expect us to try to manage headcount is judiciously as we can justin long stephens analyst okay i ll leave it at that thanks for the time patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer okay operator next question is from the line of chris wetherbee with citi please proceed with your questions patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer morning chris chris wetherbee citi analyst thanks good morning wanted to sort of pick up where we left off there just sort of coming down to the eps line so obviously a cagr achieved ph 2021 based on michael and some of the things you re talking about there should we assume that maybe we are on the lower end sort of early in the process or maybe 19 is on the lower end of that cagr just want to get a sense of i think how you think about it as it dropped down to the bottom line because it sounds like there s some incremental expenses to think about this year michael w upchurch executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah chris this is mike again i think that s a safe assumption again i d point to the step up in ptc expenses as we are now in service on our entire network so you re going to have a little bit of further benefit as you get into 20 and 21 so i think it s probably a reasonable for you to model it that way chris wetherbee citi analyst okay okay that s helpful and then i guess i wanted to maybe get a sense of capex profile so if you don t elevate it here in 2019 as you bring some new locomotives on to the network and then as a sort of step down below 20 as we ve seen psr implemented for some of the other railroads there s been a really meaningful drawdown in capital spending as a lot of assets gets hurt how should we think about it is the potential for a little bit further of a step down or what is the dynamic that might keep you from say at mid teens to an upper teens on a percent of revenue for capex jeffrey m songer executive vice president and chief operating officer yes this is jeff i will talk about that maybe the locomotive purchase i think i can explain kind of the rationale around that and promoting more high horsepower units as we transition all that we will look to continue to park or divest some of our older yard locomotives i think in general other maintenance such as engineering and maintenance away i think those things remain pretty much in line and pretty much steady state i think the difference probably remains to be other growth opportunities be it capital investments in various refined products opportunities or similar that i think we re leaving ourselves some room to continue to look at how we invest and play in that space more from a growth capacity type scenario chris wetherbee citi analyst okay so probably won t see that sort of mid teens is probably fair to say that that might be a little bit ambitious because of the opportunities you have on the top line patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer i think that s right chris chris wetherbee citi analyst okay thanks very much appreciate it patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer okay operator the next question is from the line of amit mehrotra with deutsche bank please proceed with your question amit mehrotra deutsche bank analyst excuse me thanks good morning so the company has put out long term guidance in the past that has not been met and even more recently the volume expectations have not come in nearly as expected but you could just help us like what s different this time you have this 2021 project there what s different in terms of accountability or whether it s conservatism in the planning in terms of how you roll up to the 60 to 61 or i think that would just be helpful because a lot of the conversations i have it s really some sort of long term targets maybe met with some skepticism is i think would be helpful to just put some context around how you get there and what the robustness of conservatism that you baked into the plan michael w upchurch executive vice president and chief financial officer amit this is mike i guess the prior guidance that you referred to i think what we predominantly missed with that guidance was the energy sector meltdown that we saw in 15 and 16 that seem to be the source of mess ph that we had in terms of commitment to those numbers and what we have at stake these are all numbers that are tied to our incentive compensation plans and as you saw in some of the slides in 2018 we didn t meet those expectations and therefore we had lowered incentive compensation so we re all in on these targets and that will be tied to our incentive plans this compensation committee of the board of directors will hold us accountable for patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer i ll just say we ve completed as i mentioned at the beginning we ve completed our 2019 budgeting process and and update of our 3 year plan that as mike mentioned is going to be the basis of our incentive comp targets and this plan is just based on the best information that we have available at this time feedback from customers as we learned in the energy situation that mike referred to in 2014 2015 that was also the case i mean we met with our largest crude oil shippers in january of i guess it was 2015 with them in the eye and asked them are you serious about this this is really what you re planning to move and they said yes and we built that into our plan and built that into our guidance expectations and it proved to be wrong so we re always going to have risk in our plan and in the guidance but we have sanity check this is thoroughly as we can we ve had tight dialogue with our major customers to elevate our visibility into the revenue and volume side and so we feel that this is grounded in reality and based on the best available information that we have at this time amit mehrotra deutsche bank analyst okay no i appreciate you entertaining that question i know it s bit a little bit of maybe a tough question but i appreciate that one with respect to the psr and i was wondering if you could just help us think about what part of the network are you guys going to attack or address first when union pacific did it it addresses kind of mid american network where a lot of the frac sand was moving through and obviously volumes are going down there any part of the network that you may actually attack or address first either through pilot programs or just all in maybe you would have of the volume could give us any color there i think would be helpful jeffrey m songer executive vice president and chief operating officer yeah this is jeff i will try to provide a couple tangible examples of i will say some lower hanging fruit we ve already identified i think as we look at this the mexico network just due to the complexity or of our intermodal manifest you look at train length you look at service design in mexico probably more specifically related to some of these psr opportunities and i think that s where we re really kind of setting the site is that s our priority from a service design perspective and a train start rationalization as we ve seen and continue to work with customers in the monterrey area as an example we ve made some good strides climbing out of the congestion here but also taking that further and we ve been able to rationalize some of the equipment directly out of that terminal working closely with those customers so in the area of train start that will be that will be our focus intermodal manifest product in mexico more strategically the locomotive arena i ve touched on so as train starts to rationalize locomotives should follow suit in the crews and the headcount start following suit as well so as we embark on in the first inning here i think that s where we see the initial work ongoing and starting to provide the most i think quick benefit amit mehrotra deutsche bank analyst and mike is there any change in the pro forma leverage target for the company as you think about capital structure or no michael w upchurch executive vice president and chief financial officer no nothing that we ve officially provided as you know we re in the low 2s right now we were very focused on getting that final upgrade to bbb flat and that occurred in the month of october and we feel pretty good about the balance sheet right now i think it gives us a fair bit of flexibility amit mehrotra deutsche bank analyst okay thanks so much guys best of luck in the psr invitation appreciate it michael w upchurch executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer thanks operator next question is from the line of bascome majors with susquehanna please proceed with your question bascome majors susquehanna analyst yeah i just wanted to follow up a little bit on the psr conversation can you talk a little bit about how long you ve been working with the gentleman from cnn consulting arrangement and how particularly he is incentivizing what is desirable outcome would be over this time frame and just operationally around that could you just remind everyone the percentage of your business that either originates and is terminated on your network versus the carriers that you you partner with to either originate or terminate shipments thank you patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer all right this is pat i ll take that one and then maybe ask jeff to chime in with the little color commentary first of all we re not going to get any more specific about the compensation or the arrangement that we have with sameh other than to say that his performance objectives are very much aligned with the with mine all of us around the table the executive management team in terms of long term performance targets we started working with them actually in december and he spent quite a bit of time both here in kansas city and down in monterrey engaging with the team fully kind of a lot of information sharing a lot of idea generation and then we kind of formalize the arrangement here just a couple of weeks ago but as i said in my comments i said in on not all of those meetings but many of them and i think the level of engagement and he would i asked them this question just yesterday how does he feel about the engagement of the team not just the executive team but down into the organization and i think he is very pleased with the enthusiasm and excitement the way this has been embraced and let s say that everybody everybody in this company knows that we can do better as i said in my comments we had a pretty decent quarter and pretty decent year but none of us are very satisfied with it because we know we can do better so i think the level of engagement is very high and i m very optimistic that we re going to see some very tangible we already have tangible things that are going to help us get better and drive toward operational performance improvement and sustainability as far as your question about interchange there s a belief out there i know some people have written that maybe psr doesn t apply to us because of our size and because of the magnitude of our interchange we don t believe that but we really want to focus on the messages that we are going to adopt and implement principles of psr that we think are most applicable to our network and i think there are a lot of them to do so a lot of this is just about discipline focus accountability all of those kinds of things will certainly apply and we will embrace and implement those things but the other factor is if all of the other railroads that we interchange with are adopting and implementing certain principles their own version of this then it s it makes sense that we need to be aware of and be prepared to engage with our interchange partners differently and as the result of their effort is more consistent and reliable service to us at the point of interchange then it kind of follows that we will benefit from the work that the other railroads are doing in this regard as well i also think it s important to point out and realize that the recent management change at union pacific which is our largest interchange partner particularly at the border jim vena and sameh worked together side by side on the same executive team for a dozen years or more so i think the level of coordination and communication that we ll have with up is as they continue to implement their own version of psr will be enhanced bascome majors susquehanna analyst thank you operator our next question is from the line of tom wadewitz with ubs please proceed with your question tom wadewitz ubs analyst yeah great good morning i know we re hitting a lot on this topic pat so i appreciate your patience but it s a big topic so i guess just further to the kind of role of sameh and how you think about i guess outside resource and how important that is to your psr initiative i mean should we view him as essentially he is a consultant but he is essentially full time at ksu for the next year the next two years maybe just a thought on that and then is it helpful to bring in additional people to kind of help with the not necessarily at high level but just to help with cultured teams that typically associated with some of the psr initiatives so i guess that just some more on the psr patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer i think sameh will be with us unless something unexpected happens for two years the incentive structure that we ve put together has a two year measurement period on it he will not be full time i know he s got some other commitments and other activities unrelated to us but i don t worry that we will not have his full attention i m pretty sure that even when he s not here he s going to be engaged in communicating with the team and thinking about things that we re doing here and as far as your second question we ll just have to see i didn t know if we get the kind of engagement and momentum that we re all hoping we get and sort of transfer some of the knowledge that sameh has from his 20 plus years of experience implementing this then we may not need additional outside resources but we ll just have to gauge that as we move along and see how the team engages tom wadewitz ubs analyst yeah that s great i guess just for the quick follow on if i can on multi year or target can you give a quick thought on volume sensitivity to that you gave us the volume view for 19 in or target to 2021 i mean is it is that a good or target even if you hit kind of flatter volumes in out years or do you kind of need the 19 framework to continue in 2021 to hit the or target and thanks for the time michael w upchurch executive vice president and chief financial officer well tom this is mike obviously volume is an important part of the equation in improving or and as we look back on 2018 we didn t generate that volume growth some of it because of the shutdown of the coal facility but other areas we just didn t deliver and so we do have an assumption in that 3 year period that we are going to see volume increase consistent with what we ve always suggested we were able to do and we do have some outsize growth areas that we think will allow us to generate that kind of volume growth what s unknown right now is just how much cost we are able to take out over the next few years and that will become a little bit more important visible to us as we proceed down this path and now i would like to thank that maybe we get into mid year and have some better targets around cost reduction so you may have a couple of offsetting items there but the plan definitely looks to volume growth to help deliver some of that margin improvement tom wadewitz ubs analyst okay thanks for the time patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer okay operator our next question is from the line of matt reustle with goldman sachs please proceed with your question matthew reustle goldman sachs analyst thanks for taking the question just a follow up on the or target that you did provide it s a bit lighter than what some of your peers have laid out and what some of the peers have achieved is that just being conservative because you are at the early stages of analysis or is there something about the network or your focus on growth that keeps you from guiding to sub 60 patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer i think it s a bit conservative and reflects that we re pretty early on in perhaps some more aggressive improvements that might come out of the efforts here in the next few months but it s pretty much in line maybe a little bit higher but pretty much in line with our peers matthew reustle goldman sachs analyst okay yep that makes sense and you already mentioned that ump implementing psr interchange partners in planning psr are you seeing any impact today any issues with service today as they go through that process jeffrey m songer executive vice president and chief operating officer yes this is jeff we re not really seeing any difference as of yet in service i think again the opportunity will continue to have to work primarily with union pacific with now joint kind of goals on streamlining train starts train length initiatives again i see this as a positive as opposed to a negative necessarily on any changes that other interconnecting carriers may embark on matthew reustle goldman sachs analyst okay great thanks for taking my questions operator our next question is from the line of allison landry with credit suisse please proceed with your question samantha yellen credit suisse analyst this is sam yellenand on for allison landry thanks for taking my question you ve spoken about working with customers to create more efficient unloading in order to improve car cycle times and fluidity how does that fit in with the psr implementation michael j naatz executive vice president chief marketing officer this is mike naatz i ll take that one if you think about the process you have to pick it up have to transport it you have to deliver it loading and unloading is critically important if our assets sit too long at the customer origin or destination those assets aren t turning if we have to wait for customers to load or unload that s going to cause a disruption in the network we believe that our customers will participate with us and many of them have already started to participate with us in terms of improving their loading and unloading times it s going to work to everybody s benefit and improved service of everybody does their share of the work and does it on time patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer it should also going to result in reducing congestion at some of the yards improving the way we can operate for other customers and improving the overall velocity performance of our equipment our locomotives or crews everything so it ties in very nicely samantha yellen credit suisse analyst okay and then given that volumes came in later than expected in 2018 what gives you confidence in the 3 to 4 range patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer as i said earlier just we know we could have done better than what we did in 2018 because of service and then we talked about some of the the unexpected or the impact of customer specific events like the coal customers so if you set that aside you believe that our service recovery is well on its way to being fixed kind of back to normal and then further improvement and then feedback that we have gotten from customers and really analyzing these opportunities gives us a high degree of conviction that if we can sustain a higher level of service and operating excellence and the customers continue to invest in the facilities that they re building we think we ve got pretty good visibility into what the volume growth outlook will be operator thank you and next question is from the line of brian ossenbeck of jp morgan please proceed with your question patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer good morning brian brian ossenbeck jp morgan analyst hey good morning thanks for taking my questions just wanted to focus on volume for a second and specifically the mexico energy reform opportunity can you give us a sense of what s in your expectations relative to 2018 and more specifically you ve seen lot of headlines with amlo and the administration that in fuel theft causing shortages is that an opportunity to actually import more cross border or you sort of constrained by the infrastructure for the time being patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer yes and yes it is an opportunity i will tell you and jose has shown on the phone here but we ve had a very high level of engagement with very senior cabinet level officials in mexico talking about developing a more of a longer term sustainable rail strategy for moving refined products so we don t know exactly how that s going to play out but if there was infrastructure available for loading storage trans loading there was more infrastructure available in mexico we would be moving more product than we are today so there is an opportunity and i saw just yesterday that there have been some customs changes to facilitate and streamline the movement of refined products from the u s into mexico so we feel very good about that opportunity don t have a good answer to your question about what s the upside how much more could be moved because we re literally in the middle of those conversations with particularly with the government as we speak mike if you have anything to add to that michael w upchurch executive vice president and chief financial officer i think there is certainly some uncertainty in that space however we are very much engaged i mean amlo made it clear that how mexico intends to compete in the marketplace and our perspective is that kc will serve mexico s needs whether that comes domestically or across the border brian ossenbeck jp morgan analyst okay and then one more on the guidance of 3 to 4 you ve talked about sasol a lot and you haven t really given anything specific but at least seems like good news as there is they might be seeing some production delays they ve postponed one of their own updates so can you give us any sort of context as to how you re thinking about that from a projection perspective in that 3 to 4 for next year thank you patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer well i think we are expecting strong growth in the plastics business unit with respect to sasol yes we are aware that the plant is mechanically completed but they re working through bringing that plant online and we re not expecting to receive any material shipments from them until late in the year and we don t expect that they will ramp up to full production probably until 2020 but we really can t speak for sasol those are questions that are our best to answer them but that is what we are considering in our plan brian ossenbeck jp morgan analyst okay thanks so much operator our next question is from the line of ken hoexter with merrill lynch please proceed with your question ken hoexter merrill lynch analyst hey good morning i know you run on for a bit here but i just want to say sameh is a great a great high or addition to the team even as a consultant but maybe pat just a little bit more on that when you say certain principles can you describe what it is relevant to your network and maybe what s not i just want to understand when you say you re going to adapt certain parts of it what should we expect patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer i think some of the examples that jeff gave earlier i ll ask jeff to provide some more color commentary on that jeffrey m songer executive vice president and chief operating officer yeah certainly you re for me hey whose got to get a more consistent service product i think we perform well we saw last year we didn t perform as well as we ve historically or like to so consistency is probably one of our keys and in doing so again trying to start rationalization simplifying networks total train starts again working with customers on rightsizing equipment taking some excess equipment off the system all will allow us to kind of flow better and for me consistency is really what we re what we need to achieve here most other areas we re touching a lot i just mentioned a few fueling it s interesting to see we have processes for fueling and i ll give one more detailed example of locomotive shutdown processing we have technology that shuts down locomotives automatically we have manual processes and just the experience or viewpoints from sameh or from hunter via psr and things like that is there we do save some money on how we shutdown locomotives however we probably increase our locomotive failures upon start up so making decisions based on more experience and kind of what hunter s methodology has been throughout his career may shift us one way or the other on technologies or pieces such as that fueling i mentioned locomotive fleet how we re going to look at that how we re going to right size and have opportunities to look at locomotives and kind of right sizing locomotive fleet s equipment is another big one so i think really what you re hearing from other psr implementations again i look across these segments and i don t see any of those that are really kind of applicable to our network in some form of fashion again i think we do talk about the interchange as part of that that we are different in terms of interchange but again the shared goals that we have to create more efficient interchange wherever maybe through houston certainly at the border working with interchange partners better to improve fluidity there is is in everybody s mutual interest i think one of the things i m excited about is to see from the union pacific perspective with psr kind of streamline inefficiencies through houston we know that that s for an industry that s an important segment an important geographical region for the rail industry that is we can streamline and simplify operations collectively through areas like that i think we re all going to benefit michael w upchurch executive vice president and chief financial officer ken this is mike maybe just one other quick thought and jeff kind of alluded to it earlier and pat made a comment but there s been a lot written or said about do these principles apply to kcs because of our smaller network and obviously we re interchanging a lot of traffic with up but mexico looks and feels a lot more like the other rails with originating and terminations on our own network there so i think that gives us some additional confidence that we can gain a lot of leverage there ken hoexter merrill lynch analyst appreciate that i don t think anybody s ever questioned whether it would work i think can t approve that at his first stop at i see but i guess i want to understand pat as do you view this i mean with sameh as a part time consultant i was a bit surprised by that i mean i think it would be a great addition to the team but as tom mentioned before you typically see psr as kind of a complete overhaul culture change so do you see this more as a mechanical adoption and kind of as jeff you were mentioning kind of doing piece parts versus a complete overhaul of culture change employees cutting capex changing how customers behave i just want understand is this incremental or is this kind of i mean usually a psr is kind of a shock to the system completely changed fundamentally how you operate patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer i think it s a bit more incremental in our case and i just remind people that we re not coming going back to hunter s experiences we re not coming from kind of the distance to the pack in terms of operating ratio and performance and i think if i ll even remind everyone thinking the one of the conference calls that hunter had when he was at canadian pacific talking about his desire to acquire i think this might have been norfolk southern but a question was was raised what about if this doesn t work out would you pivot to the kansas city and one of the comments he made was well they run a pretty good railroad there so i don t know that the magnitude of the change that we see is such that that kind of as you refer to a culture shock is necessary or appropriate we ve done a lot of work here internally with our employee base in u s and mexico over the last couple of years about culture principles values accountabilities i think all of this fits in with the work that we ve done there so i think it s much more of an incremental we will do this in a manner that is consistent with the culture and values that we ve been talking about with our employees for really the last couple of years and so i think it is going to be a bit more incremental which doesn t mean that it can t be pretty powerful in terms of the magnitude and the impact and at the core as jeff mentioned the core of all of this is focus on service serving our customers yes we will probably have some change management to do with customers as certain elements of this are rolled out but getting our service to a level that is consistent sustainable and allows us to realize the growth opportunities that we know are out there first ken hoexter merrill lynch analyst appreciate all that thank you just a quick one if i can sneak one in the autos you mentioned a positive outlook but it started off pretty negative is that significant closings overall to start or anything just a quick one on the auto thing michael w upchurch executive vice president and chief financial officer sure this is mike the number of the automotive manufacturers in mexico we re going through plant shutdowns throughout the holiday we got off to a slow start two of those plants ended up taking a week longer to start up than we had expected and planned for that s why we started a little bit soft we are seeing recovery now as those plants come back online ken hoexter merrill lynch analyst great thanks for the time guys appreciate it patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer thank you operator the next question is from the line of jason seidl with cowen and company please proceed with your question jason seidl cowen and company analyst thanks operator good morning gentlemen looking at 19 in terms of your or outlook how much of your conservatism on occasion on the fact that two of your major interchange partners are are implementing psr and as you might be accepting some blow back in operations because of that patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer well we haven t seen that so jason seidl cowen and company analyst you are not going to really hear that patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer sorry jason seidl cowen and company analyst that was me knocking on the wood when you said that patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer yeah jeffrey m songer executive vice president and chief operating officer this is jeff again i mentioned earlier we haven t seen any any material change either way with major interchange partners and i think again that the relationships that we have with up remain strong i think sameh and his experience with mr vena also we are going to help support that and again as we ve talked it s in our mutual best interest to run a more fluid network and that depends on both kind of both sides or both partners whatever interchange partner we re working with really looking at that and working together better on how we can streamline flows if we re able to reduce train starts straight longer trains to houston complex that s going to create better fluidity and help the overall network jason seidl cowen and company analyst okay that s understandable well switching my next follow up questions to lazaro you talked about your activity it was from volume and i know a lot of that came around sort of get back to some of the shippers because the the exchange rate was making it very unfavorable versus sort of the local factors down there can you talk about those give backs and the impacts on the reported pricing numbers and how that maybe would look exact michael w upchurch executive vice president and chief financial officer sure i m happy to talk about that a bit so we do have a rebate program in place targeted to grow traffic out of lazaro into mexico city the concept is relatively simple if the shippers hit their growth rates then the rebate is applied accordingly that rebate basically neutralizes the effect of some of the costing issues that we have that make us less competitive these rebates are basically in operation while the exchange rates are greater than 17 pesos per u s dollar so they do fluctuate depending on the value of the peso and if they don t if they don t hit their growth rates then no rebate is paid out so we believe that it s making us competitive in the marketplace jason seidl cowen and company analyst and what sort of an impact what sort of an impact did that happen reported pricing patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer it was very immaterial jason seidl cowen and company analyst okay that clears it up gentlemen i appreciate the time as always patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you next question is from the line of scott group with wolfe research please proceed with your question scott group wolfe research analyst thanks morning guys patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer good morning scott scott group wolfe research analyst so are you guys implementing any of the assets story or demurrage changes and intermodal lane closures like we ve seen from ns and up this year michael w upchurch executive vice president and chief financial officer yes we are evaluating the rates that we provide or that we charge for services that we provide so the answer is yes patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer we are evaluating at this stage as far as intermodal lane closures no we haven t considered any of those jeffrey m songer executive vice president and chief operating officer scott i think as we look at again our largest or kickoffs really opportunity for psr as i mentioned intermodal manifest it s more of a probably consolidation of trains and as we look at train length and our ability to more merge or combine those types of traffic to reduce train starts as opposed to rationalizing an entire intermodal lanes is just an example patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer and remember scott we are in intermodal business is kind of in discrete categories u s on the meridian speedway we re a bridge carrier that have cross border network and in lazaro so there probably aren t huge opportunities to go walk away from segments of that business scott group wolfe research analyst right makes sense okay and then i want to just make sure i m understanding sort of the message on this psr path so as we ve seen the other models play out right meaningful sort of 20 plus reductions or improvements in labor productivity meaningfully lower capex and loco s and step functions in or csx cp 1000 basis points in two years right i get the message right it s early and we re not really sure exactly but are these sorts of things in your mind in the realm of possibility or is it that hey our starting point in or is better we re doing a little will bit differently and don t get too carried away i just wanted to show really understanding the message patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer i would say you your final comment there we re starting from a different perspective than some of the other examples out there so we don t see all that the magnitude of that sort of initial top is going to be the same in our case as it was at a couple of the other railroads scott group wolfe research analyst and i know you ve shied from this maybe a little bit in the past but are you willing to say where the u s or is because i did i thought like historically that was closer to the 70 than low 60 so i would have thought there would be a big opportunity there michael w upchurch executive vice president and chief financial officer scott this is mike we re not going to go there we ve continued to make improvements in the u s and we ll continue to make improvements going forward but we re going to stick to our consolidated business our bread and butter the cross border and it takes both the sides of the u s and mexico to generate the kind of profitability that we are scott group wolfe research analyst makes sense thanks so much again michael w upchurch executive vice president and chief financial officer that is truly how we manage the network operator thank you our final question this morning is from the line of ivy zhang with bmo please proceed with your question ivy zhang bmo analyst yes good morning thanks for squeezing me in here just a couple of clarification is there anything in the labor agreements in mexico that might make the application of psr like we ve seen it elsewhere more difficult and the second question is just really clarification on your slide 15 i think that volume outlook slide you say there is a risk through the crude outlook the heavy crude outlook in 2019 due to canadian crude production cuts i was under the impression that that these agreements for take or pay with volume commitment is that not the case patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer yes but it s not the agreements provide compensation if there is the volume commitments or targets are not met but they don t have to ship the product so it could have an impact on our volumes but there is a mechanism to recoup particularly the capital investment that we ve made to support that business michael w upchurch executive vice president and chief financial officer i mean said in other way the per car charge that will get for not moving the volume is less than the margin we would have received on the carload that would have moved full jeffrey m songer executive vice president and chief operating officer i ll take that initial question on the labor now that the outlook mexico really doesn t prevent us from gaining efficiency certain labor productivity will probably go at it a little bit differently we still have as we ve talked about 3 and 4 person crews in the cabin some areas so you might see target or you might see one time restructuring activities as we negotiate with labor to try to maybe gain efficiencies in those areas as opposed to just the other aforementioned activities on train start rationalizations but no there s really nothing structurally different that would prevent us from rightsizing labor forces ivy zhang bmo analyst okay thank you operator thank you at this time i will turn the floor back to mr ottensmeyer for closing comments patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer okay thank you all very much for your time and attention we will be active here in the next few weeks on the conference circuit and plan to provide updates and probably more details as we get further into this so stay tuned to that and i think the only thing i can think of to say is as we close out go cheese ph we ll see you all in about 90 days thank you operator thank you this concludes today s conference you may disconnect your lines at this time thank you for your

this paper was originally written for the carter center s symposium on the 40th anniversary of the establishment of u s china diplomatic relations the u s china relationship is confronting its most daunting challenge in the forty years since the two countries established diplomatic ties current trends portend steadily worsening relations over the long term with increasingly adverse consequences for all actors involved specifically beijing and washington are transitioning from a sometimes contentious yet mutually beneficial relationship to an increasingly antagonistic mutually destructive set of interactions the often positive and optimistic forces interests and beliefs that sustained bilateral ties for decades are giving way to undue pessimism hostility and a zero sum mindset in almost every area of engagement both sides bear responsibility for this pervasive deterioration but at present the united states under president donald trump is unquestionably contributing most publicly to it primarily through its ill considered rhetorical and other overreactions to perceived chinese misbehavior while nothing about this degenerating relationship is inevitable despite the uninformed alarmist predictions of doomsayers on both sides the threat of an even more precipitous and dangerous decline in the relationship is very real and demands serious corrective measures to avert a potential catastrophe michael d swaine swaine was a senior fellow at the carnegie endowment for international peace and one of the most prominent american analysts in chinese security studies more dalzell60 to understand how we have reached this point and how to put the sino american relationship on a more positive path analysts first need to dispel the simplistic and largely negative misconceptions about the past that predominate today especially in the united states next observers need to grasp the highly adverse structural and attitudinal trends driving the current negative dynamic the serious dangers these trends pose for both countries and the world including the possibility of a new cold war and the high stakes involved in correcting or mitigating them from that vantage point policymakers may better discern which actions each side must take to stabilize and strengthen the relationship for their mutual benefit forty years of benefits and challenges since january 1979 the u s china relationship has witnessed enormous levels of both positive and negative change yet most often these changes have been beneficial on the positive side the two nations have developed a mutually productive array of ties and interactions in a growing multitude of areas from trade and investment to social and cultural exchanges as well as common initiatives for dealing with global threats such as climate change wmd proliferation and pandemics in the process china has become vastly more integrated with the rest of the international community more observant of international laws norms and procedures and more open to a much greater level of social economic and political influence than ever obtained prior to 1979 for serious students of the history of u s china relations before and after normalization there is simply no question that despite recent setbacks in some areas discussed below beijing has made enormous strides largely as a result of its opening to the outside and its adoption of market based economic development these advances have introduced greatly increased standards of living improved social infrastructure wider freedom to travel and express a variety of views and more openness to foreign influences of all sorts at many intervals along the way understandings between washington and beijing in particular have provided a major impetus for such chinese gains today within the washington policy community and the trump administration one often hears the mistaken assertion that china s progress over the last forty years has come at america s expense on the contrary these advances have tangibly benefitted the united states and many other countries china s reform driven development has contributed substantially to overall global growth most notably during recessions like the 2008 2010 downturn when the u s economy was in dire straits u s traders and investors who engage with china have made significant profits for their shareholders in the united states and elsewhere until the trump administration made the destructive decision to withdraw from the paris climate accord beijing and washington had cooperated to pursue benefits not only for themselves but for the world in curbing climate change moreover even though beijing has certainly stolen u s technology in various areas chinese investments in and technical exchanges with the united states contributed greatly to the development of cutting edge technologies in silicon valley and beyond and still do americans have also obtained economically priced and increasingly well made products designed assembled or manufactured in china and beijing has over the years provided critical diplomatic and political assistance albeit not always as much as washington has desired in addressing such global problems such as terrorism wmd proliferation humanitarian assistance disaster relief and pandemics finally for nearly two decades prior to 1989 the united states benefitted from close military and security cooperation with beijing directed at their common adversary the soviet union this strategic alignment directed at moscow was one of the main reasons for establishing u s china diplomatic relations along with washington s desire to fully integrate beijing into the international community and tap into the country s enormous potential market and despite today s oft heard refrain u s engagement with beijing was never predicated on the expectation that it would inevitably produce a politically democratic china at most some u s leaders hoped for but did not require greater levels of largely undefined liberalization in many spheres none of the above positive outcomes for the united states and the world would have occurred if washington had clung to the adversarial posture toward beijing that began with the establishment of the people s republic of china in 1949 and continued for the ensuing two decades nor would they have occurred if the united states had limited its diplomatic opening in the 1970s and 1980s to a few narrow areas of military cooperation and assistance on the negative side a number of challenges and setbacks have also accompanied the many advances since the two sides established full diplomatic relations in 1979 beijing and washington have differed significantly over the handling of many critical issues in ways that often reflected their differing political systems the legacy of hostility and conflict resulting from the korean war and the cold war and their contrasting political and social cultures and beliefs these policy divergences included the handling of volatile disputes over regional sovereignty and security issues such as taiwan controversial maritime claims along china s periphery and the korean peninsula they have extended as well to disputes over reciprocity and fairness in trade and investment cyber and other forms of espionage human rights practices within and beyond china and other international laws and global norms many of these differences have existed since 1949 others emerged or gained greater currency as normalization unfolded and still others came about only after china s development and impact on asia and the world reached massive proportions in the early 2000s for the most part however until recent years these differences while generating significant temporary downturns in the relationship usually following disruptive or unexpected actions such as the tiananmen square massacre of 1989 did not fundamentally alter the underlying strategic economic and political interests of both countries in maintaining workable and productive relations in fact by the advent of the twenty first century it had become clear that in addition to the above long standing bases for a strong u s china relationship a range of new or greatly increased largely international challenges and opportunities had emerged to reinforce both countries interest in preserving cooperative relations these included unprecedented levels of interdependence among the u s china and many other states resulting from the accelerated globalization of economic technological and social exchanges and the equally unprecedented emergence of nontraditional threats such as climate change environmental degradation global pandemics terrorism and transnational crime it became increasingly clear that the united states and china could not effectively deal with such deeply rooted problems on their own or even bilaterally successful management would require truly international forms of cooperation guided largely by those nations with the most wealth resources capabilities and intellectual capital namely the west led by the united states and both china and japan challenges become hostilities the impact of chinese repression american hyper nationalism and a shifting power balance unfortunately the positive momentum in the relationship has not lasted while new challenges and opportunities initially served to justify and compel greater u s china cooperation in the first decade of the new century three other major unprecedented negative sets of trends both domestic and international also appeared around the same time these trends greatly aggravated the differences between the united states and china and eventually overshadowed the many positive factors at work in the relationship the first trend emerged in the 1990s and 2000s and produced two serious negative outcomes severe damage to beijing s reputation in the west which undermined expectations of china s continued reform and opening and a deepening of chinese suspicions of the united states and other democracies these developments stemmed from beijing s response to three major challenges to ccp rule the collapse of communist and authoritarian states caused in part by the explosion of rapid internet based forms of communication with freer societies the emergence of unprecedented levels of corruption and socioeconomic disorder in china in the 2000s largely as a result of decades of market led rapid economic growth and the failure to develop an effective legal system and more dangerous forms of domestic terrorism and unrest occurring primarily in the ethnic minority areas of tibet and xinjiang this triple threat to ccp rule greatly heightened the insecurities of china s leaders prompting efforts to purge the party ranks strengthen overall party controls throughout chinese society and increase the economic role of the state those changes began during the jiang zemin and hu jintao eras but have intensified greatly under xi jinping most recently such perceived threats to the party s leadership have caused xi to build up his personal position within the party thus undermining the gradual evolution of the chinese political system toward a more predictable collective and institutionalized pattern of rule as a result of beijing s actions china s image among democratic states already damaged by the tiananmen square massacre of 1989 declined much further as did western confidence in china s commitment to pursue continued growth through greater opening marketization and support for the rule of law to compound this blow to the relationship chinese leaders have become more deeply suspicious of western and especially u s views and policies toward china indeed by the mid 1990s the ccp leadership concluded that washington and other democratic nations had contributed decisively to the collapse or weakening of one party systems elsewhere and might be seeking similar ends for the prc regime such fears and suspicions were magnified by the long standing deeply rooted sense of resentment toward the west many chinese feel as a result of china s so called century of humiliation a second set of highly negative trends that emerged in the 2000s involved domestic developments in the u s and the west adding more suspicions on both sides while also emboldening china s leaders in potentially dangerous ways specifically the 2008 global recession the deepening polarization of american society and the resulting near paralysis of the u s political system in dealing with critical domestic issues such as ballooning health care and entitlement costs and huge government deficits created two negative consequences for the u s china relationship one is that many chinese leaders somewhat tentatively concluded that the united states had likely entered a period of systemic decline in which america s ability to challenge or contain china s rise would drop significantly and the american model of pluralist democracy and market led economic growth would gradually lose its lustre this dual perception has strengthened the outlook of those within the chinese leadership including xi who support a more confident use of china s growing economic and military capabilities to push back against washington s supposed containment efforts and more vigorously defend or advance beijing s expanding interests overseas this approach has largely eclipsed the long standing emphasis of the deng xiaoping era on maintaining a relatively low international profile it has given greater license to those within china who prefer to give vent more vigorously to long held resentments against the west or against so called hostile western forces usually referring to the united states even more worrisome in the united states and other western countries worsening domestic economic and social problems exacerbated by the unprecedented surge of both legal and illegal non white immigrants into europe and the united states that began in the 2010s have led to the emergence of chauvinistic forms of nationalism hostile to china and other countries according to the line of thinking currently so prominent in american politics the globalization of economic and social systems most acutely manifested by beijing s conspicuous economic impact on americans daily lives lies at the root of growing domestic economic inequality job losses social injustice weakened national sovereignty and threatened cultural identity in the united states such hyper nationalism is reflected most distinctively in the extremist views of president trump he has criticized u s politicians and global corporations for selling out u s workers and the national interest in general by their support for unfair multilateral trade agreements and by moving manufacturing facilities to foreign countries most notably for u s china relations trump and his supporters have singled out china for special denunciation when they blast a range of other countries as economic predators or cheaters that aim to enrich themselves at america s expense a third major factor contributing to the overwhelming negative dynamics emerging in u s china relations is china s very rapid growth which has passed certain key thresholds over the last eighteen years china has become the largest trading power in the world surpassed the japanese economy to become the second largest economic power overall become a major source of innovation in key high tech sectors accumulated massive foreign exchange reserves and transformed its military from a defense oriented force focused mainly on the homeland and taiwan to a more expansive sophisticated force capable of operating at significant distances from china while contributing to global growth and the rise of living standards in many countries the systemic changes arising from these developments have enhanced chinese confidence abroad while greatly stoking american fears by some measures china is now poised to equal america s military footprint in the western pacific which would effectively end seventy years of u s maritime dominance in that critical region in addition beijing is using its economic resources to create what it hopes will become a vast network of interlinked economic structures and relationships extending from china to europe and africa via both land and maritime routes the so called belt and road initiative bri it is also supporting or leading a variety of other multilateral and bilateral economic and security initiatives such as new investment banks asian economic associations and strategic partnerships with u s friends and adversaries alike that could significantly shape the contours of the international system in new directions further as mentioned above china is more assertively advancing by economic political and military means its claims to disputed areas along its maritime periphery from northeast to southeast asia thus alarming many nearby states chinese confidence and assertiveness has increased but certain more pessimistic chinese sentiments have surfaced as well providing more fuel for the fears of american hyper nationalists in recent years slowing growth and rising wages have intensified worries among chinese economic policy specialists about the so called middle income trap this has produced a policy consensus regarding the urgency of transforming china s economy from a labor intensive to a more competitive innovation driven economic model that in turn seems to underlie china s present very conspicuous efforts to propel china into the top ranks of high tech nations at the fastest possible pace by fair means or foul for instance while spending billions of dollars on legitimate research and development some chinese entities now also engage in unprecedented levels of cyber espionage physical theft coercive contract arrangements and other underhanded efforts to obtain cutting edge technologies while certainly not justifying the blanket label of economic predator applied by the trumpists see below these activities along with perceived unfair protections of chinese domestic industries have significantly aggravated relations with more developed rule of law based nations such as the united states of particular note they have contributed greatly to the general souring of attitudes toward the china market evident among many u s businesses thus weakening a major historical pillar of strong u s china relations a relationship adrift and taking on water as a result of all the negative changes outlined above the common and in some areas growing strategic logic economic incentives and societal ties that long anchored the u s china relationship in the past are today rapidly disintegrating under a tidal wave of growing mutual suspicion faulty interpretations worst case assumptions about motives and zero sum policy calculations although this is happening in both washington and beijing it is at this time particularly evident in the united states american policy under trump has turned its back on the shared chinese and american interest in combating common transnational threats such as climate change and has withdrawn from or undermined potential mechanisms such as the trans pacific partnership and a revised world trade organization agreement for more effectively managing bilateral and multilateral economic problems instead the trump administration has adopted crude sledgehammer like economic policies centered on the imposition of legally questionable tariffs to force beijing to submit to fully open its markets and eliminate state involvement in the chinese economy even more ominously trump administration strategy statements like the 2017 u s national security strategy the 2018 summary of the national defense strategy and the so called u s free and open indo pacific strategy explicitly label china as a fundamental existential threat to western interests these statements allege that beijing is plotting to build a revisionist sino centric world order fundamentally incompatible with the u s led liberal international system to support this distorted viewpoint and justify its draconian actions u s officials with the implicit endorsement of too much of the overly accepting american media now depict beijing as a proponent of debt trap diplomacy involving the use of loans to subjugate developing states as a vigorous practitioner of destructive predatory trade and investment practices toward the united states and others and as a nation aiming to dominate asia and eventually the world by a combination of economic and military means in truth these accusations grossly inflate and oversell genuine american and western concerns rooted in observable facts for example while several recipients of chinese infrastructure and development loans face serious repayment problems often due to reckless and inexperienced practices on both sides there is no conclusive evidence that china is intentionally seeking to drive countries into debt problems to gain control over their assets policies etc proponents of the debt trap diplomacy argument generally base their conclusion on a single case hambantota port in sri lanka while ignoring the other tools china uses to deal with bilateral debt problems and even in that case there is no publicly available information indicating that when the export import bank of china made its first loan to sri lanka to support this project the ultimate purpose was to help china gain a concession to develop and operate the port similarly the charge that beijing is a predatory and mercantilistic economic power places a simplistic distorting label on a much more complex reality yes china s government excessively supports many industries steals technology and limits access to many domestic markets these are problems that although by no means unique to china need addressing forthrightly yet they should not obscure the fact that china is absolutely not a non market economic power the core of its economy remains driven by a huge number of privately owned market driven small and medium sized enterprises and the majority of its exports are produced or assembled by foreign corporations or joint chinese foreign ventures moreover if china were a purely predatory economic power it would not be the largest single contributor to global growth since 2008 according to the world bank thirdly despite constant repetition by officials and pundits alike there is no substantive evidence that beijing is pursuing a deliberate strategy to dominate asia and the world militarily and overturn the existing global order beijing is certainly acquiring military capabilities that undermine america s long standing predominance in that realm most notably and almost exclusively in the western pacific and it at times uses its military and para military power to intimidate other claimants to disputed maritime territories in the east and south china seas yet the former behavior is a perhaps understandable response to beijing s desire to reduce the continued vulnerability of its growing domestic and foreign assets to america s still dominant power not proof of a belligerent intent to take over the region although this could change if the current rivalry deepens greatly the latter behavior is certainly very troubling but speaks to the need for a binding code of conduct that prohibits such actions along with limits on specific types of militarization in sensitive areas beijing has shown no signs that it would reject either development to the contrary it has professed some support for them and should be pressed more to back up its words with concrete actions the u s should do the same finally the idea that china wants to overturn the global order is perhaps the most distorted accusation of all beijing has benefitted enormously from the post wwii economic order it also has taken advantage of that order in at times unacceptable ways and seeks to modify it to better reflect its growing influence this suggests the need to adapt existing institutions such as the wto and imf to more reasonably reflect china s expanding global impact while providing clearer more comprehensive and enforceable rules of behavior acceptable to all powers beijing is certainly not a proponent of pluralist liberal democracy and in that sense does not support regional or global norms or practices designed to expand such systems internationally but it is far from clear that the continued expansion of democratic systems is essential to the maintenance of the global order indeed in addition to supporting to varying degrees the major economic pillars of that order as noted above china in fact supports many others including wmd non proliferation agreements efforts to protect against nontraditional security threats such as terrorism pandemics climate change and international crime and many tenants of the un charter e g regarding the restrictive use of force to resolve inter state disputes this is hardly evidence of a desire to replace the existing order with a largely undefined revisionist order as washington now alleges lacking conclusive evidence for the overblown categorical condemnations they tend to fashion the trump administration its supporters and some individual scholars or analysts seek to buttress their accusations with arm waving references to the general history of rising powers realpolitik theories of anarchic struggle among power maximizing states or assumptions about foreign policy behavior based almost solely on a state s political system ignoring the obvious benefits accruing from the balanced u s china policy of the past the trump administration many republican and democratic members of congress and some china experts have endorsed a new highly distorted narrative of a failed american policy of concession weakness and dashed expectations that has allegedly permitted beijing to undermine u s interests at almost every turn although u s policymakers have certainly made mistakes over the past forty years as indicated above the history of u s china relations since diplomatic normalization belies this distorted viewpoint china and the united states have not always agreed and they have sometimes sharply diverged but they have nevertheless managed to work together to strengthen the regional and global economy during difficult times apply pressure on aspiring nuclear weapons states such as iran and north korea and deal with a growing variety of transnational threats the idea of a failed u s policy line provides a simple seductive story for posturing politicians ambitious former officials and iconoclastic trumpists looking for ways to blame america s ills on both the incompetence of past administrations and of course the treacherous chinese while current u s policies are most at fault for driving the current downward spiral in u s china relations beijing is far from blameless as suggested above in recent years and especially under xi chinese propaganda has become more hostile toward supposed foreign threats to domestic stability and prosperity chinese officials at many levels are now more assertive in cautioning the public about interactions with foreigners in addition the overall expansion of intrusive chinese government surveillance within china is extending to foreign business leaders ngo staff and students and beijing is now resorting to truly outrageous attempts to control domestic unrest in ethnic minority areas by placing hundreds of thousands of its own citizens in so called reeducation and training camps in violation of chinese laws and processes all of these actions contribute to the growing climate of suspicion and hostility in the relationship the chinese government only worsens this situation by denying the legitimacy of virtually all criticisms of its behavior while mouthing simplistic self serving slogans and platitudes such as repeated references to china s peaceful intentions its purely defense oriented security strategy and its commitment to win win outcomes with all nations such propagandistic emanations simply heighten u s suspicions and hyperbole and undercut the arguments of those seeking a more fact based pragmatic relationship in sum the u s china relationship is now not merely adrift without a strong anchor it is taking on water worse yet some on board seem to be arguing that it should be allowed to sink looking to the future the possibility of more serious crises and a destructive new cold war amid this dangerous downward spiral both beijing and washington have fewer incentives to undertake meaningful confidence building measures much less seek out areas of mutual accommodation and restraint on the contrary this state of affairs inclines both sides to rely more heavily on military and other coercive means to signal the firmness of their resolve it heightens sensitivities to perceived challenges both real and imagined thereby increasing the possibility of truly dangerous crises even over relatively minor disputes the danger of such crises is most evident in the western pacific where china s growing military and economic strength and the presence of several volatile points of contention between the two powers from korea and taiwan to the south china sea could result in otherwise avoidable miscalculations as each side seeks to push back against perceived tests of its determination indeed in the absence of serious and sustained efforts to moderate this current ugly dynamic the chances of a significant political military crisis in the not too distant future are increasing this could take many forms beijing could decide that what it regards as aggressive u s containment and pushback efforts justify unprecedented displays of chinese determination in the form for example of the permanent deployment of military forces on its artificial islands in the south china sea and the declaration of a corresponding air defense identification zone adiz for its part washington could decide that it needs to augment radically its deterrence capacities regarding taiwan by allowing u s warships to visit the island on a regular basis worse it could take steps to block improvements in cross strait relations so as to ensure that a now strategically valuable taiwan remains separate from mainland china this would be a direct violation of washington s long standing one china policy that has ensured peace with beijing for forty years for some misguided proponents of a supposedly more realistic adversarial relationship such crises would presumably serve a positive function by strengthening public and elite determination to push back against the other side in the u s such individuals seem to believe that only the threat or actual implementation of a complete disengagement and containment effort against beijing can generate the resources and strength of will necessary to prevent china from dominating the west and destroying the global order some advocates of this reckless and ill conceived approach insist that its positive results will prevent the emergence of a new cold war environment by forcing beijing to submit to u s demands in truth such an approach would almost inevitably produce a new cold war especially if u s russia relations continue to worsen and sino russian relations continue to improve and such an environment would prove far more destructive than beneficial for all nations concerned that is largely because u s and chinese interests today are more compatible and the fortunes of the two protagonists and the world more intertwined than was ever the case during the original cold war unlike present day beijing and washington cold war era russia and the united states were largely separated from one another economically culturally and socially few russians lived and worked abroad and few foreigners beyond those from the eastern bloc worked and lived in russia moreover economic exchange between the united states and the soviet union was minimal few countries relied heavily on russia for prosperity and stability unlike moscow then beijing today exerts major and deepening influence on countries both in asia and around the globe its economic and technological advances are heavily intertwined with many nations in the west and beyond and its military poses an increasingly credible challenge to u s military predominance in asia as noted above the huge potential risks and dangers inherent in the current situation are compounded by the fact that the united states is more insecure less confident more internally divided and more dependent on the world now than it was during the height of the cold war as a result in a new cold war a stronger china would be more likely to overestimate its ability to outmaneuver and pressure the united states by the same token a more insecure yet still very strong washington could prove more susceptible to overreaction than it was in the face of soviet cold war threats taken together these factors indicate that efforts by either or both sides to isolate or undermine the other in the spirit of the cold war of the 1950s and early 1960s will produce major dangers for both countries and other nations for that reason many other capitals would resist attempts by washington or beijing to compel them to choose sides in a zero sum struggle for dominance the resulting disruption would severely undermine the world economy cripple global and regional cooperation on many issues and impel some nations to devote more resources to military defense instead of economic development the net result of all this would be the increased likelihood of instability and crisis within nations within regions and ultimately across the globe the path back to a more realistic productive relationship given the above there is little doubt that the u s china relationship will be more contentious and intensely competitive for the foreseeable future than it has been at any time over the past forty years regardless of who leads either country that said more intensely competitive interactions do not necessarily mean a sharply confrontational zero sum relationship of the kind now favored by the trump administration and likely advocated by some in china there is an alternative to the emergence of what would amount to a new extremely destructive cold war the challenge for both sides is to develop a bilateral relationship that more realistically addresses the genuine as opposed to imaginary or exaggerated concerns of the other side while recognizing the very real common reasons to cooperate effectively where needed despite the current downward spiral incentives exist in washington beijing and other capitals to fashion what amounts to a middle path that rejects the self destructive worst case assumptions increasingly evident today along with the unrealistic belief that the relationship can somehow return to the more easily managed cooperative and competitive dynamics of the past finding this middle path requires first serious efforts to put a floor under the current near free fall in relations by minimizing the chances of highly escalatory crises occurring over inadvertent incidents or volatile issues especially in asia this is particularly important given the increasing likelihood of such crises as i have indicated above hence more substantive confidence building and crisis management measures are urgently needed track one and track two discussions have produced some notable successes in this area in recent years but such exchanges have often focused too narrowly on the prevention or successful handling of purely military incidents or accidents especially in the track one arena these undertakings largely ignore or omit the larger and arguably more relevant civilian and civil military political and structural decision making context within which each nation s militaries operate this larger context would be as critical a factor in determining the evolution and outcome of a future serious u s china crisis as would purely military to military interactions the problematic features of the broader decision making context of u s china relations that need to be addressed in a frank and open crisis management dialogue include among other things a destabilizing civilian and military leadership assumptions about the requirements for successful crisis stability and crisis deterrence such as the need to seize the initiative early in a crisis b the use of misleading or vague forms of crisis signaling at all levels c confusion or ignorance in each country with regard to the other side s civil military decision making processes and d misconceptions about the level of control exercised by the other side over an allied third party these critical features have been examined in track two discussions but have apparently not been seriously explored on an official or semi official basis the growing levels of distrust and uncertainty in the relationship make it all the more imperative for the two countries to deal directly with these concerns a first step in this direction should be the formation of a senior level u s china civil military dialogue on crisis avoidance and crisis management using input from relevant track two activities but for such a dialogue to occur both sides will need to step back from the current use of simplistic demonizing slogans and self serving platitudes to characterize the relationship instead they must internalize the reality that under current conditions a serious political military crisis between the united states and china has the potential to escalate to a major military conflagration given this stark fact each side must recognize that the other is not necessarily interested in provoking and manipulating a crisis to achieve a decisive advantage in the relationship and that any effort to do so would likely result in disaster that recognition is essential for the initial good faith effort required to engage in a frank discussion of the potentialities of crisis mismanagement on either side beyond the development of leadership crisis management understandings and skills a serious and sustained senior level crisis management dialogue if undertaken with relatively open minds could also have much broader positive consequences by increasing overall levels of understanding and perhaps even trust between chinese and american leaders such changes in perception would have positive implications for u s china interactions not only in those areas most directly associated with political military crises but in many other areas as well indeed the development of more effective crisis management and confidence building measures could promote efforts to deal more frankly with the major issues of serious contention in the relationship including trade and investment tensions technology development issues military deployments and intentions the threats posed by domestic influence campaigns and even human rights disputes in each of these policy areas greater trust and understanding could facilitate less politicized efforts to discern the actual nature and extent of the differences between the two sides and the possible dimensions of any achievable middle ground understanding this would involve a willingness to seek truth from facts and equally important an acknowledgement that the criticisms of the other side while in many cases greatly exaggerated have some basis in truth a good first step toward a more honest pragmatic description of u s concerns and desires regarding china in the economic arena was recently provided by former senior state department official robert zoellick in a set of remarks given in beijing after describing a range of u s concerns in a nonconfrontational manner he urged his chinese audience not to assume a defensive posture rely on economic autarky or maneuver on a purely tactical level vis à vis the united states 1 the same advice could also be given to u s officials while a serious crisis management dialogue and frank constructive efforts to identify the possible middle ground on specific policy areas of contention can go a long way to placing the u s china relationship on less volatile and more productive footing a more fundamental course correction is necessary for the long term the u s china relationship needs to develop a new strategic narrative one based on a realistic and feasible set of facts and assumptions about the changing capabilities actions and intentions on both sides this is particularly needed in the asia pacific where the sources of serious conflict are most present as i have written in creating a stable asia an agenda for a u s china balance of power beijing and washington must eventually recognize that neither power will dominate this vital region in the future the near inevitable balance of power that will most likely emerge instead must be made stable to avoid the most serious outcomes discussed in this essay 2 this can only happen on the basis of a common appreciation of the huge benefits that will accrue to both countries from a the cultivation of a single integrated asian economic system rather than a set of mutually exclusive and competing sub systems b effective crisis avoidance and management mechanisms and understandings regarding the region s most volatile hotspots and c a more defense oriented less escalatory set of common force postures and military doctrines the strategic logic of such a stable mutually beneficial balance of power will derive from the two nations common need to continue receiving the obvious rewards the increasingly vital region offers a steadily worsening relationship would inevitably put these benefits at risk building some level of trust and understanding between beijing and washington through a serious crisis management dialogue follow on policy discussions and ultimately a new strategic narrative seems inconceivable under current conditions it is possible even likely that leadership on both sides will need to change for real progress to occur but the u s china relationship has become too large too interdependent and too vital to global political and economic stability for the two countries to lapse into a truly hostile relationship the enormity of the potential consequences arising from avoidable errors reflects the reality today the sino american relationship cannot and must not be allowed to rest on the kind of adversarial zero sum views we currently confront a more stable asia much less a more stable overall sino u s relationship will not develop overnight this transformation can only take place over a period of years under the direction of experienced diplomats business leaders and military officers who possess a strong sense of the high stakes involved and a clear understanding of the dangers of allowing the corrosive status quo to continue the result will not be a return to the past model of relations but rather a set of interactions that is more competitive more equally balanced and yet still in many ways cooperative and mutually beneficial although undoubtedly more challenging to maintain than in the past it is essential that both sides embrace and work together to bring about this more stable set of interactions that is the only way to help ensure that the next forty years of the u s china relationship are as mutually beneficial and conflict free despite the many challenges encountered as the previous forty years have been this article was originally written for the carter center s symposium on the 40th anniversary of the establishment of u s china diplomatic relations

it doesn t take an iq of 160 plus to tell us that capitalism isn t working or at least it is not working for everyone in every country if it was socialists like bernie sanders or jeremy corbyn or even partial protectionists like donald trump would not have been thrown up as political alternatives in their respective countries nor would we have had deviant strains like chinese mercantilist authoritarian capitalism russia s oligarchic capitalism or even the japanese and korean varieties of conglomerate capitalism but there is little doubt that capitalism is still the best way to grow wealth through entrepreneurship its faults are akin to democracy s using churchill s evocative quote that democracy is the worst form of government except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time we need to apply the same logic to capitalism it is the worst possible way to organise an economy except for all those other forms that have been tried and tested and proven to be failures capitalism works where it does indeed work because it is based on information matching supply to demand based on the most important information of them all price it does not work where this information is not available or difficult to compute for example the future costs of environmental degradation communism socialism and every form of state capitalism failed because they were not based on information they were based on command estimates of what is needed to be produced in an economy but there are two factors which prevent capitalism from working and both relate to human identity issues it is often said that capital has no nationality it flows to countries and sectors where the potential for profit is best but this is an oversimplification capital itself may not have a nationality but capitalists do an apple may sell iphones all over the world but the profits are reported in the country of the company s incorporation which is often the place where its owners promoters or shareholders reside if deployed capital ultimately has to report a profit in one country based either on where a company is incorporated or where its owners reside shifting exchange rates act as a deterrent to capital flows the second issue relates to labour which is needed by capitalists to generate wealth just as capital needs to move across borders so does labour it is only when both factors of production are free to move to the areas where they can be used in an optimal combination that we can generate the maximum amount of wealth this in turn will give us a genuinely efficient form of capitalism but in the case of labour there are even greater barriers to cross border movement thanks to identity issues including xenophobia a third issue with capitalism is fundamental it may be the best way to create wealth but society benefits only if this wealth is redistributed in ways where most people can benefit or else the social support needed to justify profit making wanes taxation is one way this gets partially achieved charity is another gandhi wanted capitalists to treat themselves as trustees of the wealth they own and in recent times the world s billionaires led by warren buffett and bill gates have been exhorting the wealthy to give away more of their wealth to benefit society the giving pledge has now been taken up by 187 billionaires who have promised to gift more than half their wealth to philanthropic causes this is a very good thing to do but some counter questions are worth raising one are capitalists as good at creating social value from philanthropy as they are at generating wealth from entrepreneurship two is charity better than investment that offers productive jobs to people three if capitalists are best at creating wealth rather than giving it away should they focus on their strengths or their weaknesses and four is wealth some kind of stock that can just be given away or is it something more dynamic always expanding or contracting if bill gates gives away say 90 per cent of his shares to a charitable trust the value of this sum will never stay constant it depends on microsoft continuing to generate profits and wealth if tomorrow microsoft fails the wealth disappears equally fast though a lot of the wealth may be invested in government treasury stocks and other safe investments a recent profit warning by apple which makes 60 per cent of its money from just one product the iphone damaged its valuations substantially from over a trillion dollars four months ago its valuations were down to 737 billion 17 january wealth equivalent to pakistan s annual gross domestic product just vanished in weeks without in any way rubbishing charity the simple point one is making is that wealth is not a fixed unchanging thing it is dynamic and it can be lost any time due to business failure or misfortune sure this risk can be mitigated by investment in us treasury but then you earn 2 3 per cent annually any toll road or cold storage chain in india would generate more than that kind of return even after adjusting for inflation differentials so if apple and microsoft hold their corporate wealth in safe bonds it implies that capitalists are getting risk averse and the flight to safety is as much a threat to the future of capitalism as business risk if capitalists are busy saving instead of investing they might as well wind up their shops you don t need entrepreneurs to invest in us treasury nor is the end goal of capitalism charity it is about taking risks and investing in businesses that generate employment and growth it is more moral and ennobling to create one new job that boosts the receiver s self esteem than to create one new beneficiary through charity the mental hurdle as we noted earlier is capital s nationality if apple or microsoft want to hold their profits in dollars they cannot invest in truly transformative job creating projects in africa or india since they have to provide for exchange rate losses but if notional exchange rate losses do not matter and you invest everywhere to earn the highest return in local currency terms you may not maximise your dollar profits but will still do your job as a capitalist sensible capitalists should make a beginning by focusing not so much on charity but on investing their personal fortunes in the countries and areas even in their own country in deadbeat areas like america s rust belt that need investment and where returns will be in local currency or even just psychic at a later stage they should encourage investors in their companies to accept future share allocations from foreign investments in local currency this way they get higher returns even if this isn t the case in dollar terms in a global world surely americans can get better bang for their buck in rupee than in dollars given the rupee s much higher purchasing power parity capitalists must invest not save too much and the minute they abandon nationalist thinking and stop worrying about how to bring the money home to the us or europe their returns will actually skyrocket when capital flows where it earns the highest returns exchange rates will also duly correct bain capital estimates that global financial capital money already invested or available for investment exceeds 10 times global gdp the world is awash in capital with the likes of apple and microsoft sitting on billions of dollars in cash most of it invested in bonds earning weak returns capitalism will begin to work for more people once capitalists shed their fears of exchange rate losses and invest where real returns in local currency ie adjusted for inflation differentials exceed the returns they get by sitting on their butts and letting uncle sam borrow cheap in one line if you want to know why capitalism sucks it s because capitalists have become risk averse they are happier counting their money than investing it they are happier doing charity to stifle pricking consciences than taking big risks to create more wealth and jobs if investors and markets are forcing managements to become risk averse the best way out is to hand the wealth back to investors and let them decide now much risk they should take individually capitalism wasn t invented for companies or investors to sit on piles of idle cash the joint stock company the bedrock of capitalism was invented to invest not save beyond a point

boulder one of rich wobbekind s final slides at the 2019 economic forecast boulder beyond event jan 17 summed up a growing list of headwinds for the economy but economic growth is expected to continue wobbekind executive director of the business research division at the university of colorado boulder s leeds school of business delivered his 2019 economic forecast before a crowd of about 420 people at the embassy suites in boulder the annual event is presented by the boulder economic council i guess i m smiling i don t know wobbekind quipped at the outset of his presentation responding to boulder economic council executive director clif harald s introductory description of wobbekind s demeanor sponsored content empowering communities rocky mountain health plans rmhp part of the unitedhealthcare family has pledged its commitment to uplift these communities through substantial investments in organizations addressing the distinct needs of our communities if wobbekind was smiling it was because overall the picture is pretty positive he said with government spending pushing the economy forward in 2018 unemployment remains low he noted with consumer spending strong but that latter point illustrates a danger for the nation s economy wobbkind included a slide that said attention this presentation is not being updated due to the lapse in federal funding drawing laughs from the audience that wasn t just a joke however as certain economic data including final consumer spending numbers for december have not been released due to the ongoing partial government shutdown which itself can reduce economic growth nonetheless wobbekind s forecast is for continued growth in the new year though at a slower pace real gross domestic product increased at a robust annual rate of 3 5 percent in the third quarter of 2018 but that pace is expected to slow in 2019 we think that gdp is slowing not just due to the lapse in government funding wobbekind said he noted that the effects of the federal tax cuts which functioned as a stimulus are starting to wane predicting that the nation would return to a growth rate of 2 5 percent to 2 6 percent growth in the u s workforce is much smaller than in the 1980s or 1990s he said making growth above 2 5 percent a very difficult thing to do he said wobbekind said that the level of unemployment 3 9 percent nationwide should have slowed growth he noted that 6 7 million jobs remain unfilled across the country down slightly from a peak of 7 1 million unfilled jobs a few months ago but low unemployment has been mitigated by higher labor force participation we re squeezing as much out of the workforce as we can he said he said that job growth 300 000 jobs were added in the united states in december beating economists expectations points to a continued strong growth additionally consumer debt is at its lowest level in 25 years as a percentage of income the consumer is in pretty good shape wobbekind said we re seeing strong wage growth strong employment growth and strong income growth he noted it s very difficult to be talking about a recession in the near term unless we have some really big exogenous shock to the system economic headwinds nationally include interest rates slower global growth the value of the dollar and trade tariff issues while the u s federal reserve has been increasing interest rates for several years wobbekind said the pace of the increases might be slowing perhaps topping out at 3 25 percent by the end of the year wobbekind also noted that tax cuts enacted at the national level have contributed to a sharp increase in the federal deficit reaching 1 trillion that level of deficit spending carries real dangers for the economy he said partly because it will limit the government s ability to enact stimulus measures in the event of a recession this is a big issue he said i think this is a really big issue in colorado wobbekind highlighted low commodity prices as a danger affecting the agricultural and energy sectors drought and weather also can be a drag on the economy he said along with housing prices shortage of talented workers and low real wage increases colorado s population continues to grow but at a more modest pace than prior years it s harder to attract new residents from out of state than it used to be he said in part because of rapid appreciation in housing prices over a 10 year period colorado led the nation in home price growth he noted economic growth in the boulder metropolitan statistical area encompassing boulder county has been strong with wobbekind anticipating growth in excess of 4 percent in 2018 single family and multifamily housing permits skyrocketed in 2018 he noted though much of that growth occurred outside the city of boulder commercial vacancy rates remain extremely low for retail flex and warehouse space although office vacancy rates jumped as new product came online through november retail sales tax collections surged 9 2 percent in boulder with longmont showing an 11 2 percent increase partly due to an increase in the sales tax rate broomfield s collections increased 9 1 percent one of the greatest challenges facing employers locally statewide and nationally is access to talented workers wobbekind s remarks were preceded by a presentation by shannon block executive director of skillful colorado an organization that helps employers address skills gaps in potential hires skillful is funded by the markle foundation block noted that 70 percent of working adults nationwide do not have a college degree but 79 percent of job postings require a college degree that s a mismatch that must be addressed for the 77 percent of employers struggling to find the workers they need she said the answer block said is for employers to address degree inflation by shifting to skills based hiring she described working with aqua hot heating systems inc in frederick which was seeking a mechanical engineer the company had posted the job as requiring a four year degree and received no applicants when the company shifted to a skills based job posting it saw many more candidates and ended up hiring a former diesel mechanic who didn t have a four year degree she said skillful is expanding is digital tools for employers and is adding services in some other states including indiana

to shrink those bloated state owned industries since 2017 beijing shanghai and other big cities have forced out migrant workers who lack official permission to live there local leaders say they want

exporting countries opec is a bloc of thirteen oil rich member states spanning the middle east africa and south america combined the group controls close to forty percent of world oil production this dominant market position has at times allowed opec to act as a cartel coordinating production levels among members to manipulate global oil prices as a result u s presidents from gerald ford to donald trump have railed against the oil cartel as a threat to the u s economy in recent years several challenges to opec s influence have come to the fore including divisions within its membership the emergence of the united states as a major oil exporter and the global shift to cleaner energy sources the bloc has adapted by forming the so called opec coalition with russia and other countries but disruptions caused by the covid 19 pandemic have undermined those efforts in 2022 russia s war in ukraine and the resulting surge in global oil prices refocused attention on opec opec is born opec was established in 1960 by iran iraq kuwait saudi arabia and venezuela its membership has expanded and contracted over the years the original five sought to build a united front to respond to oil price cuts imposed by the multinational oil companies that controlled most petroleum imports into western countries as well as u s government import caps that depressed prices of foreign oil in the 1950s opec s founding members not only set out to negotiate higher global posted prices for oil but also pursued greater control over their own resources through the nationalization of international oil company concessions most opec nations now own all of their oil reserves member states coordinate policies on oil prices and production levels at regular and emergency meetings around the world often at opec s vienna headquarters delegations are usually led by the oil ministers of each member country and a secretary general appointed by the bloc is entrusted with the day to day management of the organization age of influence opec burst onto the world stage in 1973 late that year egypt and syria launched a surprise attack against israel and the united states responded with a 2 2 billion military aid package to the israelis led by the arab oil ministers opec retaliated with an embargo against the united states and a few other allies of israel and began to cut production consumers panicked and markets tightened u s president richard nixon instituted price controls on gasoline which exacerbated the situation and led to long lines at the pump secretary of state henry kissinger

profited handsomely from 1972 to 1977 the combined petroleum earnings of its members more than sextupled from 23 billion to 140 billion meanwhile in the west higher oil prices caused recessions u s gross domestic product gdp fell 6 percent from 1973 to 1975 while unemployment doubled as former cfr senior fellow amy myers jaffe and economist edward morse write opec s embargo was hailed at the time as the first major victory of third world powers to bring the west to its knees the opec of the 1970s was both celebrated and feared for its ability to impose economic pain on the west a reputation it has clung to even as events in the decades since have dented its market power brown university s jeff d colgan explains opec perpetuates the myth that it regularly manages the world oil market that reputation means its members receive more diplomatic attention than they otherwise would the rifts within opec s power has waned amid divisions within the group some of these were driven by regional power struggles others were spurred by differences in opinion over strategy and target prices for the cartel in the 1980s opec conferences were typically characterized by disagreements between so called price doves who pushed for higher output and lower prices versus price hawks typically from member states with large populations and strained budgets historically the doves have been opec s wealthier countries that are willing to tolerate lower prices if it helps preserve their dominant position in oil markets saudi arabia the united arab emirates uae and kuwait while the hawks have included iran in the 1980s iraq under saddam hussein and libya in recent years cartel politics have been further complicated by swelling budgets in some wealthy member states which have raised their break even oil price or the price at which they remain solvent squabbles among opec members have occasionally metastasized into conflicts for example iran and iraq waged an eight year long war that led to hundreds of thousands of deaths while iran accused its arab neighbors of holding oil prices artificially low to help iraq neither iraq nor iran left opec which remained officially neutral opec s worst ever crisis according to energy expert daniel h yergin was iraq s 1990 invasion of kuwait in his book the prize yergin writes that for the first time sovereignty and national survival and not merely the price of oil were at stake the invasion removed four million barrels of oil from the world market and caused prices to jump other member states feared that iraq would soon invade saudi arabia and leapt into action rather than remain neutral as they had during the iran iraq war as a military coalition came together most of opec s remaining members increased production to compensate for lost output from kuwaiti and iraqi oil fields analysts say that such a swift reaction underlines a truth about opec within the membership saudi arabia is first among equals it produces roughly one third of the group s overall crude oil for that reason the saudi leadership encouraged the trump administration s withdrawal from the 2015 agreement on iran s nuclear program and the reimposition of sanctions on iranian oil the joe biden administration is in talks with tehran to revive the nuclear deal and lift those sanctions saudi arabia s disproportionate output has stirred discussion of how much influence opec s other members really have as well as the overall power of the cartel itself but economic research generally finds that oil prices would be lower if opec didn t exist tensions with the united states since 1973 opec has often had a rocky relationship with the united states every u s president since nixon has advocated for energy independence though economists continue to debate the merits of such a goal proponents say that less reliance on opec oil reduces the trade deficit and makes the u s economy more resilient in the face of oil price swings some say that at the very least it will allow the united states to shift its focus away from the middle east still opec continues to serve as a useful foil president jimmy carter tried to raise the specter of opec to encourage americans to reduce fuel consumption trump was more explicit calling opec a monopoly and demanding that the cartel reduce prices a common refrain from presidents who view lower gasoline prices as a sort of tax cut for american drivers additionally congress has threatened to allow antitrust lawsuits against opec and its member states president biden has also blamed opec for not increasing production fast enough in response to surging oil prices that have contributed to record inflation in the united states for opec members who see the bloc as more of a political club than an economic cartel u s scaremongering about opec serves a purpose it maintains the myth of opec s importance and keeps western diplomats and policymakers focused on it the challenge of alternatives most opec members view high oil prices as a short term boon however those same high prices can spur importing countries to make investments in alternative fuel sources a dynamic that is already underway the most prominent challenge to opec today comes from unconventional oils such as shale based energies that have become available through recent technological advancements in 2009 after a nearly forty year decline in u s crude oil production shale and sand based oil extraction helped ramp up output in the decade since u s production has more than doubled the shale revolution appears to have taken the group by surprise in 2015 opec reacted to the hydraulic fracturing movement by driving prices down assuming that shale production would no longer be economically viable but new technologies have allowed american producers to tap into previously trapped oil at decreasing cost leading the united states to become the world s largest oil producer in recent years production fell in 2020 as measures to contain the covid 19 pandemic reduced oil demand but it has since rebounded and although biden has pledged to prohibit new drilling on federal lands his administration has continued to approve permits at a record pace to counter this opec partnered with russia and several other major exporters to coordinate production and stabilize prices in july 2019 they formalized this new opec coalition despite u s objections as washington worried the arrangement would increase moscow s influence over global oil markets the partnership has also created new tensions for u s allies in the cartel who now find themselves juggling competing demands from washington and moscow indeed friction between russia and saudi arabia came to a head at the onset of the pandemic in 2020 saudi arabia pushed for opec members to reduce production at a meeting in vienna in early march russia leery of a reduced market share and frustrated by u s sanctions targeting its flagship oil company rosneft refused in response riyadh initiated a price war by ramping up production a strategy it has employed successfully in the past to force moscow back to the table jaffe explains trump expressing concern about the damage rock bottom oil prices would inflict on the u s industry stepped in and tried to broker a truce and by early april the opec countries had tentatively agreed to cut production by as much as 20 million barrels a day longer term the advent of electric vehicles that run on renewable energy resources represents an existential threat to opec jaffe and morse write that rising fossil fuel costs coupled with government subsidies for renewables have spurred investments in the sector in the united states biden has called for massive investments in clean energy production and as climate change concerns take center stage in the coming years opec could take a hit looking to the future vast reserves of u s shale oil have not completely insulated american consumers from opec induced price swings changes in u s production levels are the result of dozens of private energy companies independent decisions and it can take months before consumers feel any adjustments that means when there are sudden changes in market conditions opec can gain substantial if brief market power to influence prices the 2020 russian saudi price war demonstrated the vulnerability of u s producers as the price of oil fell to its lowest point in nearly two decades it further stressed a u s industry already grappling with the effects of the pandemic at least one major u s shale producer whiting petroleum declared bankruptcy opec members with relatively high breakeven prices such as algeria are also more exposed to sustained low oil prices than russia or saudi arabia which both have low breakeven prices and significant foreign exchange reserves in 2022 russia s invasion of ukraine and harsh sanctions imposed by the west in response have caused global oil prices to surge and renewed attention on opec s role that march biden announced a ban on russian oil imports while the european union eu said it will work to reduce its dependence on russian energy by that time global oil prices spiked to their highest level since 2008 at more than 130 per barrel of brent crude an international benchmark many republican lawmakers and some democrats have therefore called for the united states to ramp up drilling still analysts say that u s shale production which collapsed during the pandemic induced price slump will take months to significantly increase some experts and politicians say the recent price hikes underscore the need for the united states to transition away from fossil fuels and toward renewable forms of energy but this too will take time and the united states could be forced to turn to opec for oil biden has reportedly been mulling a visit to saudi arabia and in march senior u s officials made their first trip to venezuela since washington cut diplomatic ties with caracas in 2019 meanwhile divisions within opec are likely to persist in 2019 for example qatar officially withdrew from opec signaling its disapproval of saudi arabia s dominance over the organization and a saudi led blockade of the country though the blockade ended in 2021 qatar has said it will not move to rejoin the bloc if riyadh continues to pursue a more assertive foreign policy it could be a challenge for the cartel to remain cohesive for opec and its newfound partner russia this possibility combined with the rise of shale oil increasing u s energy independence and global efforts to fight climate change portend a prolonged period of uncertainty
world economic forum wef president borge brende attends a news conference ahead of the davos annual meeting in cologny near geneva switzerland january 15 2019 picture taken january 15 2019 reuters denis balibouse by silvia aloisi milan reuters an array of crises will keep several world leaders away from the annual world economic forum in davos next week which takes place against a backdrop of deepening gloom over the global economic and political outlook anxieties over trade disputes fractious international relations brexit and a growth slowdown that some fear could tip the world economy into recession are set to dominate the jan 22 25 alpine meeting the wef s own global risks report set the tone this week with a stark warning of looming economic headwinds in part because of geopolitical tensions among major powers some 3 000 business government and civil society figures are due to gather in the snow blanketed ski resort but among them are only three leaders of the group of seven most industrialized countries japanese prime minister shinzo abe german chancellor angela merkel and italian premier giuseppe conte donald trump who stole the davos limelight last year with a rare appearance by a sitting u s president pulled out of this year s event as he grapples with a partial u s government shutdown on thursday the white house said trump had also canceled his delegation s trip to davos because of the shutdown now in its 27th day treasury secretary steven mnuchin and secretary of state mike pompeo had been expected to lead the u s team according to two senior administration officials french president emmanuel macron is also skipping the meeting as he seeks to respond to the yellow vest protests while british prime minister theresa may battles to find a consensus on brexit outside the g7 the leaders of russia and india are shunning davos while china whose president xi jinping was the first chinese leader to attend the elite gathering in 2017 to offer a vigorous defense of free trade is sending his deputy instead that will leave the likes of british finance minister philip hammond chinese vice president wang qishan and a host of central bankers with the task of trying to reassure business chiefs davos will be dominated by a high level of anxiety about stock markets a slowdown in growth and international politics said nariman behravesh chief economist at ihs markit the leadership presence is lower than last year but those who are going will be seeking to impart a sense of confidence and calm business and investors nerves revamp before the u s cancellation a trump administration official had said the u s delegation would also discuss the importance of reforming institutions such as the world trade organisation the international monetary fund and the world bank trump has harshly criticised globalization and questioned u s participation in multilateral institutions such as the wto calling for a revamp of international trade rules davos watchers said the absence of so many top leaders this year did not mean the glitzy forum had lost its status as a global stage for top politicians to present their agendas abe is going to davos not just as japanese prime minister but also as chair of the g20 it will be a perfect opportunity to lay the groundwork of upcoming g20 meetings said a japanese government source familiar with international affairs of course there may be inconveniences such as missing opportunities to hold bilateral meetings but that won t undermine the importance of davos he said a chinese official who has attended davos regularly but will not go this year said china had never expected to make progress at the meeting on the trade dispute with the united states it s just an occasion for making a policy statement he said the low turnout among major western leaders may also give more prominence to political personalities who may otherwise be upstaged davos will be the first major international outing for brazilian president jair bolsonaro elected on a wave of anti establishment and conservative nationalism also seen elsewhere he said on twitter he would present a different brazil free of ideological ties and widespread corruption for business chiefs the value of davos lies not so much in the public sessions but in the networking and dealmaking opportunities on the sidelines of the main conference it s the best place to pitch for ideas build connections and get your brand known said chen linchevski chief executive of precognize an israel based start up developing software that prevents technical or quality failures at manufacturing plants it s the kind of place where in a few days you meet people you wouldn t easily meet otherwise said linchevski who is paying 50 000 swiss

colin taylor seeks opinions of commercial property leaders regarding the prospects for the market in 2019 mike bayley managing director bayley corporation ltd the flow of investment funds into the commercial property market which reached unprecedented levels in 2018 is likely to gather even more momentum in 2019 this will be led by continuing diversification out of the residential market particularly in auckland where the housing market is likely to remain fairly flat for the next few years at the high value end of the commercial property market the big influx of foreign capital in 2018 is likely to be just the tip of the iceberg when the world s largest real estate private equity investment firm blackstone group outlays nz 636 million to acquire a portfolio of office buildings in the viaduct being managed by bayleys property services the rest of the globe takes notice and generally follows suit expect more big investments from the likes of blackstone invesco and sc capital in 2019 while we re a small market new zealand offers global investors a safe harbour in an increasingly turbulent world enhancing connections and exposure to international markets will therefore be a major focus in 2019 in this regard bayleys acquisition last year of knight frank s new zealand business operations and our strategic international alliance with them will provide additional global profile for our clients regulatory restrictions will continue to constrain the amount of funding our main australian owned banks can allocate to commercial property however we expect at least one offshore based non bank commercial property lending entity to establish itself in new zealand this year this will open up more funding options for the development sector in particular the investments funds and syndication market should continue to flourish and offer an increasingly diverse range of products such as augusta s tourism property fund and potentially a residential focused fund later in 2019 mark synnott ceo colliers international nz the rise of flexible co working new streams of non bank lending and the emergence of build to rent are among the key trends expected to shape the new zealand commercial property market in 2019 the market has well and truly bounced back after a post election slump in late 2017 and early 2018 on the back of this uptick in activity we anticipate another exceptional year of growth in 2019 the ongoing low interest rate environment and sustained offshore investor interest will underpin this growth the flexible co working sector looks set to continue its meteoric rise the sector has doubled in the past three years and our forecasts show it will double again within the next five the main constraints are low levels of vacancy and high levels of rental growth in the office sector reducing available options non bank lending is likely to become more prevalent as developers seek alternative funding models at the same time margins for builders are likely to grow due to consolidation in the construction sector development conditions will make speculative builds more attractive particularly in the office sector there is already strong demand for spec build office space as evidenced by uptake at no 1 sylvia park and 10 madden st in the wynyard quarter the build to rent sector is poised to gain momentum in 2019 this emerging asset class involves the development of residential properties at scale to be rented out privately rather than sold to owner occupiers the asset class is maturing in the united state and europe but remains in its infancy in new zealand we expect auckland s first build to rent residential project to launch in 2019 with further development to follow non bank funders and syndicators will be watching these developments closely in the wider residential development sector kiwibuild will dominate the lower end of the market however skills shortages in the construction industry and the greater margins to be made in the commercial sector will constrain the amount of supply the industrial sector looks likely to continue its stellar run significant deals last year included the 93m sale to goodman of foodstuffs distribution centre in mt roskill and the 53 75m sale to augusta of the castle rock business park in christchurch these were the largest ever industrial transactions in the north and south islands respectively scarce land supply low vacancy and rising rents will continue to attract investors with syndicators and listed property companies remaining active at the top of the market in the office sector strong uptake of prime new supply will contribute to growth in the secondary sector this is good news for landlords but local investors will find it hard to compete against offshore buyers at the top end of the market invesco s recent purchase of a 50 per cent share off precinct of the anz centre in auckland for 181m highlights the continued levels of offshore interest in new zealand office assets retail s transformation will continue in 2019 with some 179 380sq m of new supply expected in auckland over the next few years including significant shopping centre expansions at scentre group s westfield newmarket and kiwi property s sylvia park the new retail precinct at commercial bay will consolidate the shift of auckland cbd s epicentre towards the waterfront and the western cbd fringe hotel supply in auckland looks set to finally catch up with demand revenue in the sector will remain strong due to continued tourism growth and an anticipated spike in demand during the america s cup and apec conference in 2021 meanwhile the regions are likely to continue booming the residential and commercial markets in hawke s bay and wanaka in particular have undergone tremendous growth over the last two years which will continue as populations grow growth in the other two golden triangle centres of hamilton and tauranga will also remain strong john urlich commercial manager barfoot thompson there has rarely been a year that has seen us looking more globally for clues than this one the economic outlook is now well signalled and a necessary easing of global stock markets is required and due clearly it will pay to be cautious this year but we believe the property sector will make for continued good investment it s been said nobody wins a trade war and the effects of us policy will be felt globally not least of which will be china this uncertainty will continue to affect the over bought sharemarket and some necessary correction will ensue despite this we are optimistic we will see a relatively soft landing central banks are growth sensitive and the recent tightening of monetary policy will afford them room to move and move they will we are confident any potential slowdown will be managed all of this has only one immediate consequence on our commercial property market investment sentiment as we saw last year business confidence is the single business determinant in the demand for real estate our advice to any investor tenant or occupier is that they must consider the current global ructions against the fundamentals of our property market and our fundamentals are very good we would point to record low vacancy rates across all sectors coupled with an unavailability of development options that makes for a challenging environment for real estate agents building will remain costly and the uptake of office space has exceeded predictions consequently there is a relative shortage of prime office space available in the next few years the refurbishment of secondary buildings will continue to remain a feasible option and overall the outlook for the auckland cbd and city fringe will remain consistent rental levels will grow the industrial markets are tighter still and the need for greater space continues and will do so going forward a high proportion of industrial occupiers we survey have suggested that more space would benefit their business immediately retailing remains a science and a cautious approach to both site selection and rental levels remains paramount for tenants and occupiers that said consumer confidence remains consistent and the outlook overall remains positive the next quarter may prove testing some sectors such as hotels childcare and residential apartments in the city s periphery are showing signs of increased supply but again overall we are positive to place a 2019 twist on an old cliche we believe fortunes will favour the bold but measured andrew stringer senior managing director cbre nz two highly influential but diverse market factors will push new zealand property markets into 2019 first global capital remains very focused on new zealand and auckland in particular we anticipate continuing demand from offshore investors assisted by recent changes to oio thresholds but with a shift back down the risk curve international capital will continue to dominate major transactions focusing on highly secure property moving away from the add value focus of the past 24 months high quality potentially low yielding assets backed by strong and long leases are in strong demand across all sectors with a number of dedicated long walt funds scoping new zealand this is likely to see renewed opportunity for capital recycling through corporate sale and leasebacks secondly decision making around how businesses will use their premises will continue to see greater levels of intelligence applied across all sectors of the market office and industrial occupiers are applying ever increasing knowledge to how they use premises more effectively in order to drive employee engagement and business performance large corporates and smes alike are acutely attuned to the importance of workplace to business performance multi disciplinary advice has never been more important as occupiers seek to use property to add value for instance the co working phenomenon is now entrenched in our market and major office landlords are embracing it but leveraging this flexibility requires specialist workplace strategy in the industrial sector we re seeing this theme emerge as the massive increase in infrastructure spend continues to drive location decisions particularly for manufacturing and distribution the improving connectivity of auckland to the waikato region will broaden choice for industrial occupiers but how specific locations will suit businesses will depend on supply chain benefits traditional property silos are no more and sector lines are being blurred so it will be important to apply multi disciplinary intelligence in 2019 todd lauchlan managing director jll in a world where global media headlines have been dominated by economic uncertainty throughout 2018 new zealand s economy and property investment market has continued to quietly confidently and purposefully propel itself forward with little fuss or undue self promotion with an official economic growth rate of 3 per cent for the year ended september 2018 new zealand has outperformed many of its key trading partners around the world and is set to do so again in 2019 and beyond according to commentator forecasts the investment case for new zealand at a structural level remains strong and robust and more so if anything the benefits of the underlying attractiveness for larger scale investment in new zealand assets has certainly been demonstrated in recent years since 2014 the total market size of 5m plus deals across all commercial property sectors has averaged 4 6b per annum by way of comparison between 2005 and 2013 the average was 1 8b only on any scale this represents a huge structural market shift which cannot be explained by underlying inflation alone new zealand is now increasingly on the global investor stage and should be proud to be so our transparent market and no stamp duty or capital gains tax obligations are undoubted advantages so what for 2019 well we see more of the same although opportunities are admittedly a little bit tougher to find these days as investors appreciate the true value of what they own with new zealand s economy being so well balanced though we see scope for strategic investment in office industrial residential alternatives and high end retail mixed use assets although we are notably concerned for secondary retail space given such dramatic changes in how we shop as a nation these days there is a lot still to play for supported by strong population growth forecast for new zealand and auckland in particular over the next 25 years there are of course challenges ahead and not every property will be a winner careful planning and strategy will be crucial as always to stay ahead of the curve at a more localised level auckland s continuing infrastructural advances are opening up new locations through enhancing accessibility in wellington geographical constraints on development continue to drive value and promote ingenuity across all property sectors in christchurch the creation of so much modern space following the devastating earthquake in 2011 will revolutionise how business is done there in future and across the rest of the south island with increased physical and technological connectivity many more areas are opening up as very real opportunities for investors there is no reason why 2019 should not be another good year for property in new zealand paddy callesen managing director savills auckland when forecasting the year ahead those of us who have been in the market for a long time hope for the best but always assess the risks there is never any shortage of dark clouds and turbulence in far off markets while these markets do affect us we trade in a local property environment influenced by continued high net migration and population growth low interest rates low vacancy rates and non inflationary economic growth this leads to demand in all property sectors in the absence of an economic meltdown how will these factors shape the auckland property market in 2019 industrial property will be the standout investment category in 2019 vacancy will remain at record low levels along with a scarcity of suitable development land and increasing construction costs rents will continue to increase across the prime and secondary grades and we also anticipate some further yield compression cbd office property will continue to attract interest from offshore with local buyers priced out of the market transaction numbers will be subdued as a result of limited available stock demand will continue to be less strong for retail centres and suburban office property with the best transactions reflecting either high yielding or add value opportunities performance in the housing market will directly affect confidence in the retail property market indications of ocr cuts in 2019 may help residential sentiment to remain steady or possibly improve despite the recent retraction in australia development opportunities will continue to be dominated by domestic demand especially in the smaller scale sub 10ha space pricing will be subject to influence from reduced sales volumes and price moderation of completed products a material influence will be demand from parties seeking to deliver kiwibuild opportunities we also expect to see continued improvement in the availability of credit in 2019 as several of the larger development projects office and apartment reach completion john davies co owner director ray white commercial auckland challenging conditions for apartment developers in central auckland are resulting in the mixed use project market softening increases in the cost of labour materials and fees have eroded margins to the point where banks are declining to lend resulting in developments especially smaller scale being suspended or abandoned this trend is likely to gather momentum in 2019 larger better established developers with momentum scale and cash will fare best the trend for residential property investors to move into commercial property will continue once the darling of property investors the residential sector has lost its shine and is now highly regulated with a considerable management burden capital growth is no longer a given and returns have been eroded to a level that is unacceptable to many commercial property offers many attractive characteristics including superior returns net leases and longer lease terms these factors will continue to prompt those looking for passive holdings and income to buy commercial property lease lengths are a key consideration for investors and lenders and this will continue with medium to large scale investors now demanding leases of at least 10 years where just a few years ago six year leases were acceptable this has now increased in part due to banks offering better terms on investments with leases of 10 years minimum overall auckland s commercial property market will remain strong over the medium term at least supported by population growth and a large amount of domestic and overseas capital chasing limited opportunities critical to the ongoing strength of the market are population growth transport and infrastructure development the lift in land values relating to the unitary plan is most likely now behind us future property hotspots will be linked to key infrastructure and access projects including the city rail link proposed pedestrianisation of queen st roading improvements and retail centre extensions such as 277 broadway and sylvia park
