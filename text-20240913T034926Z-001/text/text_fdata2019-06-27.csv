2 source refinitiv 3 key performance indicator 4 the benchmark index of the company chairman s statement performance challenging is how i have described in my recent statements the job that ciaran our portfolio manager faced in trying to produce a positive return in the year ahead and that is exactly how it was ciaran gives greater detail about how he has met these challenges in his management of our portfolio but he has had to contend with a volatile uk stock market reflecting both brexit factors and global economic and political factors as well as growth continuing to be the more dominant investment style as we have seen in recent years the latter is not so helpful for our portfolio manager s investment approach with its greater focus on value which over the longer term has proved very rewarding so it is therefore pleasing to be able to report a positive return with our net asset value for the year to 31 march 2019 being 5 7 although it was slightly behind the company s benchmark return of 6 4 unfortunately this has not been matched by our share price total return which was only 1 2 and reflects our discount widening out further to 15 8 at the year end this is particularly disappointing as at the board s urging invesco have been putting much greater effort into marketing the company but despite these activities the company s shares and it must be said those of others in our sector have continued to be out of favour however recent periods of being out of favour and underperformance should be seen in the longer term context as shown on page 5 with our net asset value total return of 237 3 over ten years comfortably exceeding that of our benchmark additionally over twenty years our net asset value total return exceeds that of the benchmark as illustrated by the chart below revenue and dividends for the year to 31 march 2019 earnings per share increased marginally at 12 0p per share 2018 11 9p we have declared a fourth interim dividend of 4 20p per share together with aggregate interim dividends of 7 25p this gives a total dividend per share for the year of 11 45p 2018 11 05p an increase of 3 6 this is ahead of the annualised inflation rate for the year to 31 march 2019 of 2 4 as measured by rpi and is consistent with our objective of growing the dividend at above the rate of inflation the fourth interim dividend will be paid on 26 july 2019 to shareholders on the register on 28 june 2019 the shares will be quoted ex dividend on 27 june 2019 this is the 22nd consecutive year of dividend increases and maintains the company as an aic dividend hero the board continues to aspire to maintain this status in accordance with its investment objective to grow the dividend over time above the rate of inflation corporate governance the board takes its corporate governance responsibilities seriously and as highlighted on page 24 of this report it has conducted its affairs in line with the 2016 aic code of corporate governance and the 2016 uk corporate governance code the association of investment companies in 2019 and the financial reporting council in 2018 have respectively issued revisions of these codes both of which apply for the company s financial year beginning 1 april 2019 nonetheless where practical the board has adopted these later code versions early including annual re election of all directors and providing a note in this annual report of the individual contribution that each director brings to the board the board having had the honour to serve as chairman of the company for the past seven years it is my intention to retire during the course of next year and my successor will be announced in due course as a result i have handed over the chairmanship of the nomination committee to roger walsom and davina curling has been appointed as the senior independent director this is all part of the plan that the board has put in place and which will see further refreshment of the board in a phased way over the next few years management fee as i reported in my recent interim statement following constructive discussions with the manager the board announced a reduction to the previous fee arrangement effective 1 october 2018 under the new arrangement the manager is entitled to a management fee of 0 60 per annum for the first 150 million of market capitalisation and 0 50 for amounts over that level all other terms relating to fees and notice remain unchanged from the existing management arrangements the board believes these changes will help to make the company a more attractive investment for investors and ensure that invesco share in shareholders desire to see the discount reduced outlook i like no doubt many other shareholders had expected that i would by now be writing about the outlook for a post brexit world but it is not to be or at least not yet indeed if ever so particularly with the accompanying political impasse in the uk it will continue to weigh on the uk stock market and with the prospect that even when it is eventually resolved one way or the other it is likely to be followed by a period of considerable political uncertainty in the uk although by many measures much of the uk stock market is not highly valued the continued uncertainty together with various geopolitical and economic uncertainties in the rest of the world means that i must run the risk of being accused of becoming repetitive as i again say that it is going to be challenging for our portfolio manager however i continue to take comfort from the fact that history suggests that trends such as growth investing will eventually run their course and value investing will come back into fashion also that the attractions of the income growth sector will again be recognised i am sure that ciaran s investment approach will win through and that we will continue to meet our investment objectives of growing the income and capital in real terms over the longer term however it is important that our investment performance continues to improve and that the qualities and benefits of the company and its portfolio manager are better recognised by investors so that the currently wide discount can be substantially reduced the board remains supportive of invesco s determination to achieve this and whilst it remains confident that they will succeed the board recognises that it is important that shareholders see this happening soon agm this year s agm will again be held at invesco s west end office 43 45 portman square london w1h 6ly at 2 30pm on 11 september 2019 the notice of the agm of the company is on pages 64 to 66 and a summary of the resolutions is set out in the directors report on pages 35 and 36 whilst i urge all shareholders to vote in favour of these resolutions by returning their completed voting papers or voting online i hope that as many shareholders as possible will attend the agm in person and have the opportunity of hearing from ciaran about the portfolio and his views on the outlook as well as meeting myself and my fellow directors hugh twiss mbe chairman 27 june 2019 strategic report manager s report for the year ended 31 march 2019 market review the uk equity market provided a positive return in the twelve months to 31 march 2019 however the market s mid single digit rise masks periods of significant volatility the market peaked in may 2018 before falling to an eighteen month low in december 2018 only the strong rally during the first quarter of 2019 secured a positive return overall for the period under review principal drivers of this volatility included concerns around global economic growth central bank monetary policy and the impact of us sino trade war rhetoric at home the question of the uk s exit from the european union continued to dominate the domestic agenda the extended political uncertainty saw the value of sterling fall materially through the year reaching a twenty month low of us 1 23 in december as a vote of no confidence against theresa may was called over the terms of the negotiated eu withdrawal agreement against this challenging backdrop the bank of england s monetary policy committee voted to increase the uk s base interest rate by 0 25 at its august 2018 meeting but kept rates on hold for the rest of the period as the political impasse continued portfolio review the company s net asset value including reinvested dividends delivered a total return of 5 7 over the year under review compared to the ftse all share index which delivered a total return of 6 4 the portfolio continues to have a significant weighting in the industrials and support services sectors reflecting a diverse collection of businesses across a range of industries the portfolio s exposure to this theme supported absolute performance over the year as positive momentum in a number of investments provided a strong contribution to returns the portfolio s holding in experian provided the standout return delivering strong share price growth over the twelve months under review the global information services company released full year results in may 2018 which included an 8 increase in the dividend positive momentum persisted through the remainder of the period as the market responded warmly to news of acquisitions and supportive trading updates bunzl compass and softcat also provided a positive return over the year the portfolio s exposure to uk domestic value opportunities also supported absolute performance over the year given the challenges facing many domestically orientated sectors stock selection proved crucial whitbread provided the largest positive contribution to returns as the company s share price rose very sharply in august 2018 on news that it had agreed the sale of its costa coffee business to coca cola for 3 9 billion i was supportive of this decision believing that the sale would release significant value for shareholders elsewhere the portfolio s holding in domestically orientated retailer next defied the well publicised crises facing many high street retailers to deliver full year results in line with expectations the 15 rise in online sales offset more challenging declines in in store retail sales emphasising that the company s multi channel offering allows it to see the growth of online shopping as an opportunity not a threat meanwhile the 4 5 increase in the annual dividend reaffirmed the company s focus on shareholder returns holdings in legal general and nichols further supported absolute returns however the portfolio s holding in young co s brewery youngs provided a notable negative contribution to returns over the year despite trading strongly in the first half of the period under review the company s share price fell very sharply during the october sell off despite some subsequent recovery the portfolio s holding failed to recover all lost ground obvious headwinds include the company s exposure to the domestic economy with a lack of resolution to brexit a likely driver of negative market sentiment however i continue to believe that youngs is an attractive long term investment for the portfolio with a best in class offering and the scale and the quality of management required to further consolidate its market the company is asset backed owning the majority of its pub estate which provides an additional degree of comfort in the underlying value of the business whilst the continued political uncertainty and consequential sterling weakness of the past year has proven a headwind to many domestic sectors the internationally orientated companies of the ftse all share index have outperformed the portfolio has significant exposure to internationally orientated businesses notably within the oil gas sector which provided a strong positive contribution to absolute performance bp provided the largest positive return supported by a rising oil price in the first half of the period and latterly the release of better than expected results for 2018 in february 2019 to my mind the sector s outlook is dependent on these companies ability to cover their dividends with free cash flow which is ultimately reliant on capital discipline within the sector rather than price strength in the underlying commodity whilst the portfolio has a significant weighting in the oil gas sector its relative underweight position versus the ftse all share index meant that the portfolio did not benefit from the full rise experienced by the market the portfolio s relative performance was also held back by the non inclusion of other international sectors notably mining uk listed mining companies have historically paid dividends from current earnings which are highly correlated to commodity prices given the inherent volatility underpinning earnings within the sector it remains my view that there are alternative areas of the market better suited to the objectives of the portfolio the portfolio continues to have a significant exposure to the utilities sector with investments in pennon national grid severn trent united utilities sse and drax as noted in previous reports these companies variously offer an attractive combination of asset backing and with the exception of drax index linked dividend growth all except drax are highly regulated monopoly infrastructure owners where the regulator ensures a fair outcome for customers whilst ensuring that well run businesses can adequately reward shareholders the portfolio s holdings in the utilities sector provided a strong positive return to performance during the period under review volatile market conditions in the latter half of 2018 prompted investors to seek so called safe haven equities which created a more constructive backdrop for the sector than we saw just twelve months ago more recently we have seen a reiteration of the labour party s utilities nationalisation agenda to my mind the risks of a general election and the labour majority result required to push through a nationalisation agenda at below fair market value has diminished and as such i believe the sector is attractively valued meanwhile the portfolio s holdings in regulated water utilities have progressed well through the first phase of the regulator s periodic review notably ofwat has awarded united utilities pennon and severn trent fast track status deeming their business plans to have set a new standard for the sector the periodic review remains ongoing but this is nevertheless encouraging progress which offers firms both financial and reputational benefits amid the strong equity performances drax provided a stand out return the company s share price traded well for the majority of 2018 supported by rising wholesale power prices and performance improvements in the production of biomass electricity in october 2018 news broke of a deal between drax and the spanish energy firm iberdrola to buy the latter s uk power generation plants meanwhile strong full year results confirmed the completion of a 50 million share buyback programme and a double digit percentage increase in the full year dividend in terms of portfolio activity during the period new investments were made in royal bank of scotland phoenix and merlin entertainments the portfolio s holding in n brown was sold outlook portfolio strategy market conditions proved particularly challenging in 2018 as uk equity markets recorded one of the worst calendar year performances in a decade for the majority of the period i maintained a low level of borrowing in the portfolio believing that market conditions warranted a continuation of a conservative investment approach however the significant market volatility during the final quarter of 2018 presented an opportunity to modestly increase the portfolio s gearing this decision proved supportive for relative performance enabling the portfolio to benefit from the wider recovery in equity markets during the first quarter of the new year more than would have been possible without this use of borrowings which at the time of writing is largely unchanged despite my improved confidence there remain a number of reasons for continued caution the nature of the united kingdom s future relationship with the european union continues to be debated whilst globally slowing economic growth remains a concern additionally markets remain firmly fixated on the rhetoric from central banks particularly the united states federal reserve fed on balance the risks facing uk equity markets appear less so compared to where they were just twelve months ago despite no resolution to brexit having emerged there are hopes that following theresa may s resignation the new conservative leader can renegotiate some elements of the deal so that parliament can accept the agreement and the uk can finally leave on or at least around 31 october although the threat of a no deal exit can still not be entirely ruled out meanwhile there has been a shift in tone from the fed signalling that we have reached the end of this interest rate cycle the market is now expecting the fed to cut interest rates in july with a 0 25 move now priced in whilst the continued strength of the us dollar has proven supportive for international earners within the market any clarity on brexit has the potential to spark an appreciation in the value of sterling from current levels which would support the domestic companies within the portfolio i continue to seek to achieve both capital and income growth from the portfolio with a balance between the current level of income and future income growth i continue to believe that it is sensible to remain conservative in my investment approach albeit there are increasingly opportunities available it remains my goal to invest in companies whose prospects are not wholly dependent on an improving economic outlook but supported by self help or industry specific dynamics overall i am cautiously optimistic in my outlook for the uk and i remain confident in the long term return potential of the holdings in the portfolio i continue to believe that the portfolio is well positioned to meet its performance objectives most notably in respect of delivering dividend growth which has grown for the past 22 years consecutively ciaran mallon portfolio manager 27 june 2019 business review strategy and business model invesco income growth trust plc is a uk investment company and its investment objective is set out below the strategy the board follows to achieve that objective is to set investment policy and risk guidelines together with investment limits and to monitor how they are applied these also follow and have been approved by shareholders the business model the company has adopted to achieve its objective has been to contract the services of invesco fund managers limited ifml to manage the portfolio in accordance with the board s strategy and under its oversight ifml is also responsible for providing company secretarial marketing accounting and general administration services in practice many of these services are performed under delegated authority by invesco asset management limited iaml a company related to ifml references to the manager in this annual financial report should consequently be considered to include both entities the portfolio manager responsible for the day to day management of the portfolio is ciaran mallon all administrative support is provided by third parties under the oversight of the board in addition to the management and administrative functions of the manager the company has contractual arrangements with link asset services to act as registrar and the bank of new york mellon international limited as depositary and custodian investment policy the company s investment objective principal investment aims investment policy and risk and investment limits combine to form the investment policy of the company investment objective the company s investment objective is to produce income and capital growth superior to that of the uk stock market and dividends paid quarterly that over time grow above the rate of inflation principal investment aims the company aims to have a portfolio yielding more than the ftse all share index in order to generate sufficient income provide shareholders with dividend growth in excess of inflation over the longer term achieve capital growth in excess of the ftse all share index over the longer term reduce risk by diversifying investments across a wide range of companies and sectors and enhance returns by utilising borrowings when appropriate investment policy and risk the company invests principally in quoted uk equities and equity related securities of uk companies selected from any market sector at certain times some exposure to fixed interest securities may be considered desirable by the manager whereby the main criteria for inclusion will be income liquidity and credit quality the company utilises borrowings when appropriate in order to seek to enhance its returns but the associated risks will be mitigated by limiting the maximum amount of borrowings that can be utilised and by investing predominantly in liquid investments so that any gearing can be managed in a timely way one of the company s principal characteristics is that it diversifies its investments across a wide range of companies and sectors so minimising the risks associated with having too much invested in one stock or sector the manager s aim is to have a broad cross section of the best performing stocks that he can find consistent with this characteristic investment limits the board has prescribed limits on the investment policy among which are the following no more than 10 of gross assets will be held in a single investment no more than 15 of gross assets will be held in other listed investment companies no more than 5 of gross assets will be held in unquoted investments and borrowings may be used to raise market exposure up to a maximum of 25 of net assets except for borrowings all of the preceding limits are measured at the time of investment the company does not currently use derivative instruments but could potentially do so for efficient portfolio management purposes subject to specific sanction of the board performance key performance indicators the board and manager work closely together to achieve the company s investment objective to help shareholders understand how this is achieved and monitored the following key performance indicators are used the income available to be paid as dividends compared to retail price inflation rpi the net asset value performance the company s total return performance compared to inflation its benchmark and its peer group the premium or discount to net asset value at which the company s shares trade and ongoing charges the total cost to shareholders incurred by the company dividends and dividend payment policy the board aims to pay a sustainable level of base dividend that grows above the rate of inflation and so provides shareholders with real long term growth in dividends additional dividend payments above the sustainable level may be paid on a case by case basis as special dividends the board s dividend payment policy is for the directors to declare four dividends in respect of each accounting year with one payment in respect of each calendar quarter currently payments are made in october december march and july additional special dividends may be declared at the discretion of the directors for the year ended 31 march 2019 three interim dividends have been paid and the directors have declared a fourth interim dividend in lieu of a final dividend of 4 20p 2018 4 10p per share the first two interim dividends were of 2 40p 2018 2 30p each per share and were paid on 26 october 2018 and 28 december 2018 the third interim dividend was 2 45p 2018 2 35p and was paid on 15 march 2019 the fourth interim dividend will be paid to shareholders on 26 july 2019 in total the directors have declared dividends of 11 45p an increase of 3 6 over the previous year further details on the dividend payment history can be found on page 5 the board keeps under review the income generated by the portfolio the average yield of the portfolio during the year was approximately 4 4 a premium of 0 4 over the average yield of the ftse all share index over the same period which was 4 0 whilst the portfolio s yield has been and is anticipated to continue to be at a premium to the index the premium has narrowed in recent years many of the large higher yielding companies in the benchmark index have dividends which are not well covered by earnings inclusion in the portfolio takes account not only of current dividend yield but also dividend safety and growth prospects asset performance on 31 march 2019 the share price and the net asset value nav per share were 262 0p and 311 2p respectively the comparable figures for 31 march 2018 were 270 0p and 305 2p the board monitors the company s nav and compares its performance with relevant indices principally the ftse all share index which is the company s benchmark the nav total return of the company for the year was 5 7 compared with a total return of 6 4 for the ftse all share index 6 3 for the ftse all share 5 capped index 7 7 for the ftse 100 share index and 6 6 for the ftse 350 high yield index peer group performance the board monitors the performance of the company in relation to both the aic uk equity income sector as a whole and as this sector is quite diverse in its objectives and structures to those companies within it which the board considers to be the peer group that most closely matches it as at 31 march 2019 out of the 23 investment trusts ranked within the aic uk equity income sector the company was ranked 8th over one year 18th over three years and 16th over five years by nav performance source j p morgan cazenove discount the board monitors the discount at which the company s shares trade in relation to the value of the underlying assets and how this compares to other investment trusts in the aic uk equity income sector during the year the company s shares traded at a discount between 10 7 and 17 1 at the year end the discount was 15 8 2018 11 5 and the average discount of the sector was 3 5 2018 3 4 source j p morgan cazenove the board and manager closely monitor movements in the company s share price and dealings in the company s shares in order to avoid significant overhang or shortage of shares in the market the board asks shareholders to approve resolutions every year authorising the repurchase of shares for cancellation or to be held as treasury shares and also their issuance this may assist in the management of the discount these authorities were not utilised in the year the company does not currently hold shares in treasury however should the board consider it to be in shareholders interests to do so then it is the board s policy to sell shares held as treasury shares on terms that are in the best interests of shareholders ongoing charges the expenses of managing the company are reviewed by the board at every meeting the board aims to minimise the ongoing charges figure which provides a guide to the effect on performance of all annual operating costs of the company the ongoing charges figure is calculated by dividing the annualised ongoing charges including those charged to capital by average net asset value during the year expressed as a percentage the ongoing charges figure for the year was 0 73 2018 0 75 financial position at 31 march 2019 the company s net assets were valued at 182 million 2018 179 million the portfolio comprises mainly equity investments with some fixed rate securities the company has an overdraft facility which is limited to the lesser of 25 of net asset value and 25 million at the balance sheet date drawings were 7 1 million 2018 2 0 million note 11 to the financial statements gives details of the facility due to the readily realisable nature of the company s assets cash flow does not have the same significance as for an industrial or commercial company the company s principal cash flows arise from the purchase and sales of investments and the income from investments against which must be set the costs of borrowing and management expenses the company s use of financial instruments is disclosed in note 1c and note 15 to the financial statements future trends details of the main trends and factors likely to affect the future development performance and position of the company s business can be found in the manager s report section of this strategic report on pages 9 to 11 further details as to the risks affecting the company are set out below under principal risks and uncertainties principal risks and uncertainties the audit committee regularly undertakes a robust assessment of the risks the company faces on behalf of the board see audit committee report on page 25 the following are considered to be the most significant risks to shareholders in relation to their investment in the company further details of risks and risk management policies as they relate to the financial assets and liabilities of the company are detailed in note 15 to the financial statements investment objective there can be no guarantee that the company will meet its investment objective the board monitors the performance of the company and has established guidelines to ensure that the investment policy is followed market risk all of the investments held in the year traded on the london stock exchange the prices of securities and the income derived from them are influenced by many factors such as general economic conditions interest rates inflation political events and government policies as well as by supply and demand reflecting investor sentiment such factors are outside the control of the board and manager and may give rise to high levels of volatility in the prices of investments held by the company although the risk to the company s performance can be mitigated to an extent by adjusting the level of borrowing or holding cash balances investment risk there is a risk that the performance of stocks selected for the portfolio might disappoint any poor performance of individual investments is mitigated by the diversification of the portfolio and the continual analysis of all holdings by the portfolio manager the portfolio of investments held at 31 march 2019 is set out on pages 17 and 18 shares shareholders are exposed to certain risks in addition to risks applying to the company itself the market value of the shares in the company may not reflect their underlying net asset value nav and they may trade at a discount to it the board and the manager monitor the market rating of the company s shares and both share repurchase and issuance powers are in place that can be used to help in its management and are intended to be renewed at the agm the value of an investment in the company and the income derived from that investment may go down as well as up and an investor may not get back the amount invested past performance of the company is not necessarily indicative of future performance while it is the intention of the directors to pay dividends to shareholders quarterly from revenue earned the ability to do so will depend upon the level of income received from securities and the timing of receipt of such income by the company accordingly the amount of quarterly dividends paid to shareholders may fluctuate gearing arising from borrowings whilst the use of borrowings by the company will enhance the total return on the shares where the return on the company s underlying securities is positive and exceeds the cost of borrowing it will have the opposite effect where the underlying return is negative the board and the manager keep the level of borrowing under review regulatory the company is subject to various laws and regulations by virtue of its status as a public limited company registered under section 833 of the companies act 2006 its status as an investment trust and its listing on the official list of the uk listing authority loss of investment trust status could lead to the company being subject to tax on the realised capital profits on the sale of its investments a serious breach of other regulatory rules could lead to suspension from the official list a fine or a qualified audit report other control failures either by the manager or any other of the company s service providers could result in operational or reputational problems erroneous disclosures or loss of assets through fraud as well as breaches of regulations the manager reviews compliance with tax and other financial regulatory requirements on a daily basis all transactions income and expenditure are reported to the board the board regularly considers all perceived risks and the measures in place to control them the board ensures that satisfactory assurances are received from service providers the depositary and the manager s compliance and internal audit officers report regularly to the company s audit committee reliance on third party service providers the company has no employees and the directors are all appointed on a non executive basis the company is reliant upon the performance of third party service providers for its executive functions in particular the manager performs services which are integral to the operation of the company failure by any service provider to carry out its obligations to the company in accordance with the terms of its appointment could have a materially detrimental impact on the operation of the company and could affect the ability of the company to successfully pursue its investment policy the manager may be exposed to reputational risks in particular the risk that litigation misconduct operational failures negative publicity and press speculation whether or not it is valid will harm its reputation any damage to the reputation of the manager could result in potential counterparties and third parties being unwilling to deal with the manager and by extension the company the board regularly reviews the quality of services provided the company s main service providers are listed on page 69 viability statement the company is an investment company operating as an investment trust as defined by sections 1158 and 1159 of the corporation tax act 2010 as such the company is a collective investment vehicle rather than a commercial business venture and is designed and managed for long term investment the directors take a long term view in their stewardship of the company as does the portfolio manager in his management of the portfolio long term for this purpose is considered to be at least five years and so the directors have assessed the company s viability over that period however the life of the company is not intended to be limited to that or any other period in assessing the viability of the company the board considered the principal risks to which it is exposed as set out on pages 14 to 16 together with mitigating factors the risks of failure to meet the company s investment objective and contributory market and investment risks were considered to be of particular importance the board also took into account the capabilities of the manager and the varying market conditions already experienced by the company since it commenced operations in 1996 in terms of financial risks to viability the investments comprising the portfolio are currently all listed on the london stock exchange and readily realisable the company has no long term liabilities and the portfolio s total value is significantly higher than the value of its short term liabilities and annual operating costs consequently there appears little to no prospect of the company being unable to meet its financial obligations as they fall due in the next five years based on the above the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the five year period of their assessment board responsibilities as set out in the directors report on page 27 the directors have a statutory duty to promote the success of the company whilst also having regard to certain broader matters including the need to engage with employees suppliers customers and others and to have regard to their interests s172 companies act 2006 however the company has no employees and no customers in the traditional sense in accordance with the company s nature as an investment trust the board s principal concern has been and continues to be the interests of the company s shareholders taken as a whole notwithstanding this the board has a responsible governance culture and also has due regard for broader matters so far as they apply in particular the board engages with the manager at every board meeting and reviews its relationships with other service providers at least annually board diversity the company s policy on diversity is set out on page 30 the board currently comprises six non executive directors of whom one is a woman thereby constituting 17 female representation summary biographical details of the directors are set out on page 22 the company has no employees social and environmental matters as an investment company with no employees property or activities outside investment environmental policy has limited application the manager considers various factors when evaluating potential investments while a company s policy towards the environment and social responsibility including with regard to human rights is considered as part of the overall assessment of risk and suitability for the portfolio the manager does not decide to or not to make an investment on environmental and social grounds alone the company does not have a human rights policy although the manager applies the united nations principles for responsible investment the company is an investment vehicle and does not provide goods or services in the normal course of its business or have customers accordingly the directors consider that the company is not required to make any slavery or human trafficking statement under the modern slavery act 2015 this strategic report was approved by the board on 27 june 2019 invesco asset management

company can invest in fixed income securities and at the year end the level of exposure was 1 3 million 2018 1 5 million the directors estimate that a 1 change in interest rates applied to this balance would have no impact on reported revenue return but would increase or decrease reported capital return by 2 000 2018 16 000 the company had no cash flow exposure to floating interest rate assets 15 1 3 other price risk other price risk i e changes in market prices other than those arising directly from interest rate risk or currency risk may affect the value of the equity investments but it is the business of the manager to manage the portfolio to achieve the best return possible the directors manage the market price risks inherent in the investment portfolio by meeting regularly to monitor on a formal basis the manager s compliance with the company s stated investment policy and to review investment performance the company s portfolio is the result of the manager s investment process and as a result is not wholly correlated with the company s benchmark or the market in which the company invests therefore the value of the portfolio will not move in line with the market but in accordance with the performance of the particular company s shares held within the portfolio if the value of the portfolio rose or fell by 10 at the balance sheet date the profit after tax for the year would increase or decrease by 18 8 million 2018 18 0 million respectively 15 2 liquidity risk is minimised as the majority of the company s investments constitute a diversified portfolio of readily realisable securities which can be sold to meet funding commitments as necessary in addition an overdraft provides short term funding flexibility the board monitors the portfolio s liquidity liquidity risk exposure the financial liabilities are detailed in note 11 the contractual maturities of these are all three months or less based on the earliest date on which payment can be required 15 3 credit risk comprises the potential failure by counterparties to deliver securities which the company has paid for or to pay for securities which the company has delivered it includes but is not limited to lost principal and interest disruptions to cash flows or failure to pay interest credit risk is minimised by using a only approved counterparties covering both brokers and deposit takers and b a custodian that operates under basel iii guidelines the board reviews the custodian s annual independent control assurance report and the manager s management of the relationship with the custodian following the appointment of a depositary assets and cash held at the custodian are covered by the depositary s restitution obligation accordingly the risk of loss is remote cash balances are limited to a maximum of 2 5 of net assets with any one deposit taker this limit is at the discretion of the board and is reviewed on a regular basis the maximum exposure to credit risk arises from amounts due from brokers and cash held by the custodian as at 31 march 2019 no amounts were due from brokers 2018 195 000 and no cash was held with the custodian 2018 nil there are no financial assets that are past due or impaired during the year 2018 none 16 fair value fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities the fair values of the financial assets and financial liabilities are either carried in the balance sheet at their fair value investments or the balance sheet amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value due from brokers dividends receivable accrued income due to brokers accruals cash at bank and overdraft fair value hierarchy disclosures nearly all of the company s portfolio of investments are in the level 1 category as defined in frs 102 as amended for fair value hierarchy disclosures march 2016 the three levels set out in this follow level 1 the unadjusted quoted price in an active market for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable i e developed using market data for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly level 3 inputs are unobservable i e for which market data is unavailable for the asset or liability categorisation within the hierarchy is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of each relevant asset liability the valuation techniques used by the company are explained in the accounting policies note all of the equity investments are deemed to be level 1 due to less visibility on prices for the fixed income investments these are reported as level 2 these represented 0 7 2018 0 8 of the portfolio at the balance sheet date there were no transfers between any levels during the year and no investments were held in level 3 17 capital management the company s total capital employed at 31 march 2019 was 189 295 000 2018 180 680 000 comprising borrowings of 7 067 000 2018 1 974 000 and equity share capital and other reserves of 182 228 000 2018 178 706 000 the company s total capital employed is managed to achieve the company s investment objective as set out on page 12 including that borrowings may be used to provide gearing of the equity portfolio up to a maximum of 25 million or 25 of net asset value borrowings comprise of a bank overdraft details are given in note 11 and net gearing was 3 9 2018 1 1 at the balance sheet date the company s policies and processes for managing capital were unchanged throughout the year and the preceding year the main risks to the company s investments are shown in the strategic report under the principal risks and uncertainties section on pages 14 to 16 these also explain that the company is able to gear and that gearing will amplify the effect on equity of changes in the value of the portfolio the board can also manage the capital structure directly since it has taken the powers which it is seeking to renew to issue and buy back shares and it also determines dividend payments the company is subject to externally imposed capital requirements with respect to the obligation and ability to pay dividends under the corporation tax act 2010 and under the companies act 2006 respectively and with respect to the availability of the overdraft facility by the terms imposed by the lender the board regularly monitors and the company has complied with the externally imposed capital requirements this is unchanged from the prior year 18 contingencies guarantees and

precious metals expert rick rule shares gold nuggets of wisdom maurice jackson of proven and probable and rick rule of sprott usa engage in a wide ranging discussion covering pareto s law the importance of courage and conviction in investment copper mentors and the upcoming sprott natural resource symposium maurice jackson joining us for conversation is legendary investor rick rule of sprott usa mr rule welcome to the show in our interview last month we addressed a number of topics regarding where and what sprott usa is focusing their attention on in the natural resource space and at the conclusion of the interview rick you stated that we should discuss pareto s law which is known as the 80 20 law but you put an interesting perspective on the law that i had not considered mr rule expand the narrative on pareto s law and please introduce us to the concept of the 4 rick rule sure and actually i ll take a little further than that with your permission most people have heard of the 80 20 principle which suggests that in any sort of major field of human endeavor 20 of the people engaged in that activity generate 80 of the utility in other words 20 of the people do 80 of the work this turns out to be broadly speaking true and it was pointed out in social sciences by an italian social scientist at the turn of the last century named pareto hence it s called pareto s law it s appropriate to junior mining speculation because among other things the performance dispersion curves that is the performance of relative management teams aligns well meaning that 20 of the management teams in junior mining generate 80 of the money made what s important for readers to understand is that if you take that successful population the 20 and you run them through the same performance dispersion curve they conformably align meaning that 20 of the 20 do 80 of the 80 or 4 of the population base generates about 65 of the positive utility in the sector and i think it works for at least one more standard deviation which would suggest that 20 of the 20 of the 20 or eight tenths of 1 generate about 40 of the total utility generated in the sector which is to say that one of the most important things that you can do as a speculator is identify and align yourself very patiently with the serially successful operators in the sector and that is probably the most important work that you can do as a speculator that isn t to say that identifying a robert friedland or a ross beaty or a lukas lundin or a bob quartermain is the only work you need to do the truth is that when you buy stocks that are headed by those people you are still subjected to risk you re still subjected to volatility you re still subjected to the vagaries of exploration but your most important task is to identify the serially successful people particularly identify the serially successful people in bad markets where you don t have to pay a huge premium to be associated with them and then hang on for dear life and let them work their magic over time maurice jackson we brought you on today to share some of your golden nuggets of wisdom for those of us that ascribe to join you with the serially successful now you re famous for stating you must have courage and conviction which is a critical distinction you ve mastered expand for us the psychology of courage because this is a key attribute that you have rick rule well it turns out it does take courage maurice we were looking back over the exploration capital partnerships series which is a series of investments managed by myself going back to 1998 and we found interestingly that first of all the vast majority of the money that was made was made in a relatively small number of stocks ones that increased in price 1 000 or more particularly where of course those investments were accompanied by warrants what was interesting was that despite the fact that we all want immediate gratification the average holding period for a ten bagger or 1 000 gain was almost five years so one needs to be patient the courage comes in because almost every stock that we enjoyed 1 000 gain in we experienced a 50 share price decline in at some point in time or another during our holding period for the stock the most dramatic example was the most successful stock that we speculated in during that period which was paladin uranium that stock was a bellwether in my career we participated in a 0 10 financing and i think it was probably 1999 when nobody cared about uranium and we were rewarded for our contrarian genius by seeing the stock go from 0 10 to 0 01 that is we experienced a 90 loss in the stock when you experience a 90 loss maurice there s no such thing as a hold it s either a buy or a sell mercifully we had the courage to reexamine our precept and determined that we were right and the market was wrong we did buy some more stock and amazingly over the next five years that stock went from 0 01 to 10 two times after the initial 90 decline that stock fell by 50 or more so you had in the course of an almost fictionally good gain depending on how you count the start 0 01 or 0 10 to 10 the initial test of courage came with a 90 loss and there were two future losses in excess of 50 similarly lumina copper backed by the serially successful ross beaty we did the first financing if my memory serves me well at 0 50 and that stock ended up being liquidated in this series of seven transactions i forget what the total was but somewhere in the 140 range but either two or three times during the seven years that we held that stock the stock declined by 50 or more so it s important that you understand that while price is interesting price is only relevant to the extent that it varies appreciably from value which means that you have to have an opinion as to value and an opinion as to the ability of a management team to continue to add value following price alone if you experience a 50 decline and you assume as a consequence of that decline that there s something wrong with the company almost always you will be shaken out of circumstances that can give you a big gain and let me give you one further illustration maurice that i think will amuse readers we aren t just talking about speculation in this context warren buffett the legendary investor and ceo of berkshire hathaway points out that four times during his stewardship of berkshire hathaway arguably the most successful investment company in the history of american investing four times during his tenure the stock has fallen by 50 or more now interestingly if you examine a price chart of berkshire hathaway going back to 1968 from 1968 until present those 50 declines relative to the share price escalation can t even be seen on the stock chart they re invisible because the stock has moved so much over 40 years but if you experienced those 50 declines at the point in time when you experienced them they still caused you trouble so i think that s where the courage comes in maurice jackson and before we leave courage does the thesis or is the scenario very similar with uranium and copper today rick rule well i think it is if i m understanding the question correctly the courage associated with commodity markets is that the real money is made by buying industries that are in effect in liquidation and that does take special courage certainly if you looked at the uranium business today the industry suggests that the incentive price to produce uranium including prior year write downs which the industry never likes to talk about and cost of capital is about 60 a pound so you make the stuff for 60 bucks a pound and you sell it for 27 you lose 33 bucks a pound a 100 million times a year and that takes some courage buying companies that have no probability of making money at the current commodity price requires courage some would say it requires insanity the difference i think between courage and insanity is simple arithmetic uranium even in the united states a wealthy economy that allegedly can afford alternatives generates about 15 of our base load power so it seems to me that the equation around uranium is that in the next six or seven years either the price goes up to the point where the industry stays in business or the lights go out those are your two choices there is no way to replace 15 of base load electricity supply with any form of electricity in the next six or seven years so the courage comes into play and displaces allegations of insanity i think when you recognize that if you have the courage to speculate in an event that has to happen but where you re just not sure when it s going to happen it s still a rational activity maurice jackson and how about copper as well rick rule copper s more interesting there are plenty of companies that make cash at 2 75 per pound 2 75 lb copper but the incentive price for opening new copper mines is more like us 3 50 lb and us 3 50 lb because it s a capital intensive business assumes the artificially low interest rate environment that we re living in today if you had market interest rates that is if the prime interest rate was at 5 or 6 or 7 the incentive price to produce copper would be up in the four or four and a quarter range now if the world economy doesn t soften substantially and i don t know if it will or it won t the copper price will go higher because on a global basis we are living off of copper deposits that were discovered 30 and 40 years ago and put into production in most cases 20 to 30 years ago deposits are very long of tooth the great deposits in the world like bingham canyon have been operating for 100 years chuquicamata 100 years freeport mcmoran inc s fcx nyse grasberg deposit 40 years escondida 30 years these are very very very long of tooth and we aren t developing new copper deposits because we re not at incentive price so supply is going to be constrained in the copper business the fly in the ointment here maurice is if the economy does slow down and i m not saying it will i don t know it could be that demand for copper declines a little bit too i m willing to take that bet because my suspicion is that the ascent of man continues hat is the billion and a half people at the bottom of the demographic pyramid continue to get richer and continue to urbanize and the consequence of urbanization is intensive use of electrical power which requires lots of copper so my supposition is that even in an economic decline that demand for copper will be surprisingly resilient because of its utility and particularly its utility to the poorest 20 of the people on earth maurice jackson how does the application of conviction fit into this narrative rick rule well first of all one needs to become educated enough that one can have conviction the suggestion that i ve made on your show so often is that one must be a contrarian or one will be a victim that bear markets are the authors of bull markets my conviction with regards to that maurice was born simply of experience i ve been in this business almost 45 years and i ve been through depending on how you count five cycles and i understand the capital intention the cyclical nature of the mining business and i know very well by now that bear markets are the authors of bull markets one of the things that gives me conviction that this market will turn is that that is simply the nature of markets for things like commodities which are essential to mankind other examples of conviction have to do with the intelligent application of science if you have been around geologists and geology for a very long time you begin to understand first of all what a good geologist is relative just to a geologist and you understand what good geology is and good geology overcomes a lot of sins market sins management sins all types of sins so i think that conviction is the conjunction of experience and education which while they re related are not the same thing having the education to understand the value of various inputs and having the experience to have in your past seen outcomes associated previously with the same type of experiences that you re having today gives one conviction i guess in my case the third factor in conviction is having experience with people and teams i have a high degree of confidence that if i go into a business with a robert friedland or bob quartermain or ross beaty or lukas lundin as a consequence of their past performance i have a lot of conviction that if i support them and stick with them if i m patient that i ll have a happy outcome and that s really born of experience maurice jackson you touched on science but how about philosophy how does that factor into your decision making process rick rule well i try not to let it enter in too much to be honest with you i try to be mathematically and empirically based the truth is in terms of philosophy my own political philosophy is very much libertarian and free market oriented which means that i m always a sucker for the gold bug pitch the consequence of that is that i try not to listen to my philosophical side as often now related to a libertarian philosophy is an acceptance of the precepts of austrian economics and in particular the predictions with regards to the activities of markets and groups of people that was evidenced by ludwig von mises in human action i would say in that sense the understanding of economic cycles and the understanding of the impact of cycles on human action that that part of my investing philosophy has been absolutely instrumental to my success von mises points out that although all of us believe ourselves to be rational fact gatherers that s not what we are we have a view of ourselves as impartial observers that gather information hither and yon and process it in a rational fashion but that s not what we do in fact we gather information that is convenient to our prejudices and our paradigms and we use the information that we gather to support those same prejudices and paradigms von mises also points out that our expectation of the future is set by your experience in the immediate rather than the distant past which is why bull markets go on longer than they should and why bear markets go on longer than they should if you have done lots of work around an investment or speculation and you re attracted to it but your experience in the last five years has been that you get spanked for all your hard work you tend to be cautious and conservative in bear markets which is precisely when the markets are cheap because your most recent experiences have been bad rather than good conversely in bull markets where stocks are doubling and tripling for no reason you do two things you confuse a bull market with brains that is you assume that your good performance is in some way shape or form due to your own efforts and you also become less cautious your expectation for the future being set in the immediate past means that you re irrationally bullish even in a market that s up 400 or 500 which is as you know by now maurice something that s not an uncommon phenomenon in our sector yeah i ll leave it there maurice jackson well rick this is great information here s one that really i find attractive with your thought process here because most people shy away from this and it sticks with courage and conviction you re not afraid to put capital into companies that are in challenging jurisdictions either through civil unrest or through a silent partner known as our benevolent government wishing to do some profit sharing with your capital why is that rick rule i ll tell you why maurice it s not like i think congo or russia or sudan or bolivia are the greatest countries on the face of the earth i m certainly cognizant of political risk the truth is however that i ve experienced lots of political risk in places that are alleged to be good my worst personal experience with political risk was here in the people s republic of california but i ve also had money stolen from me by legislatures in places like british columbia the truth is that investors who look like me old and caucasian tend for some reason to believe that money that s stolen from us in english according to the rule of law is somehow less gone so i m not afraid of bad jurisdictions it s just i m also afraid of so called good jurisdictions and what i ve learned is that in jurisdictions where capital feels comfortable a lot more exploration has taken place which means that the probability that i m going to find a high quality deposit in a jurisdiction that i m also comfortable in is very low the probability is that i ll find the type of deposit that will give me the returns i m looking for 1 000 plus are much more likely to occur in jurisdictions that have not been looked at as thoroughly perhaps my most important mentor in the 1970s told me that in exploration money is made employing new ideas in old places that is new technology or old ideas in new places but if you re using old ideas and old places you re assuming that you re smarter than everyone that came before you which is usually an incorrect assumption so as an example investments around the application of new technologies like three dimensional seismic measurement while drilling and new fracturing and recovery techniques have revolutionized the old oil fields of west texas that s a new idea in an old place but old fashioned exploration technology that is projection of existing trends things like that work well in places like congo and kazakhstan places that haven t been explored thoroughly for 40 or 50 or 60 years as a consequence of challenging social economic and political circumstances so i would say that while i m certainly cognizant of political risk i define political risk much differently than many of my competitors maurice jackson may i ask was that mr lundin that you were referring to there rick rule although adolf lundin would have said exactly the same thing the guy i was referring to was a man named jack brown of a private oil and gas company called wagner brown maurice jackson before we leave speculation we have a subscriber that wanted me to ask you if you would share three junior exploration stocks in the gold sector that you like best rick rule i m not allowed to do that i m u s securities licensed and the consequence is that i can t make anything that smacks of a recommendation to people whom i don t know i can repeat the offer that i ve made on your show so many times which is to evaluate people s portfolio rank people s portfolio for them if they e mail it to me but a general set of things that can be construed as recommendations is something that i can t do is the person who s talking particularly about precious metals maurice jackson junior mining stocks junior explorations stocks for gold companies rick rule ok if they re for gold companies i can tell you that i have been buying two recently this doesn t suggest that your subscribers should buy them this isn t a recommendation this is simply a disclosure about two companies i ve been buying one is pan american silver corp paas tsx paas nasdaq run by ross beaty which is down really substantially in price as a consequence of i think the market misunderstanding the acquisition of tahoe resources and the other would be sabina gold silver corp sbb tsx rxc fse sgsvf otcpk which is a very large project in northern canada which is access constrained meaning that access to it is by a winter ice road it s a very large deposit that people are afraid of because they don t understand when it s going to come in production but we see it as both a large and high grade deposit that is highly likely to come into production it s important that your listeners note that these are not recommendations these are not suggestions these are not tips these are merely two companies that i have been buying maurice jackson well rick thank you for sharing that and rick speaking of gold you re a strong advocate for owning physical precious metals but not in the context that we usually hear from those who advocate having physical precious metals why does rick rule own precious metals rick rule fear i regard precious metals as insurance and insurance in particular against political interference with living standards i believe the most important determinant certainly not the only determinant but the most important determinant of the gold price is faith or lack of faith in the u s dollar as expressed by the u s 10 year treasury which is the world s benchmark security the dollar is very very strong despite historically low interest rates i think that s partly about strong equities markets i also think it s about the relative weakness of competitors to the u s dollar while i consider the u s dollar to be a flawed instrument it is certainly a less flawed instrument than the japanese yen the chinese yuan the euro the canadian dollar all of those doug casey famously says that the u s dollar is the prettiest mayor at the slaughterhouse that might be a bit extreme but i need to say that i m less sanguine about the u s economy i m less sanguine about our balance sheet 22 trillion in on balance sheet liabilities and 100 trillion in off balance sheet liabilities and our ability to service those debts given the fact that we re running a federal deficit at a trillion and a half dollars a year i have less faith in the u s dollar than many of my global counterparts and my suspicion is if you saw a circumstance where faith in the u s dollar began to roll over as it did in 2001 the price response that you d see in gold would be one where even if you had a substantial holding of u s dollars in your portfolio the money that you would make on your insurance policy which is gold could offset the money that you would lose in your u s dollar based accounts i see gold myself as a medium of exchange that s simultaneously a store of value and the consequence of that is that i own gold for insurance purposes maurice jackson you re also famous for saying that it is payment in full can you elaborate on that for us rick rule i think that s very important the u s dollar is a promise to pay it supposes that people will continue to accept it almost every fiat currency in history has always retreated to its intrinsic value which is of course zero if as an example rather than having u s dollars in your jeans you had venezuelan bolivars you would understand the promise for what it was something that could be broken gold is very different it doesn t rely on faith gold isn t a promise to pay it is in and of itself payment it is an asset that isn t simultaneously somebody else s liability and i think that s very very important i don t think as an example that you re seeing the chinese government the chinese central bank buying gold because they like the chart i think that you re seeing them buy gold because they re afraid that the u s government will use u s financial markets and u s dollars as a weapon in foreign exchange transactions and so the chinese are looking and i just point out the chinese others are looking the same way to a medium of exchange that isn t under anybody s control and isn t a promise to pay but rather constitutes payment in and of itself it s interesting to note maurice that over the last couple of days in the news you will see that venezuela exported seven tons of gold to uganda and then apparently onto either dubai or turkey a pariah state that can t necessarily trade in u s 10 year treasuries can trade can buy and sell gold but even more interestingly apparently those gold bars date from the 1940s and they were payment from the united states to venezuela for oil that was sold in world war ii when the venezuelans had some doubt as to the outcome of the war and weren t willing to take u s dollars for their oil they were willing to take gold so even a creditor as strong as the united states has periods of time has circumstances where their promise which is what their currency is isn t acceptable but there hasn t been a time in recorded history when gold wasn t acceptable maurice jackson well i tell you what i m loving the insights that you re sharing with us what do the current metal prices suggest to you right now rick rule a mixed message really i think the very recent strength in the gold price by very recent i mean the last 10 days is a function of investors realization that the united states is unlikely to let the market dictate the interest rate that is society in the united states has decided that spenders should prevail over savers and that the interest yield on the u s 10 year treasury should be artificially lowered when the u s fed does it s called quantitative easing if you and i did it it would be called counterfeiting i think there s a realization in the market that the united states government is at the very least considering another round of counterfeiting now in terms of counterfeiting although the united states is a very competitive economy we don t lead in counterfeiting in the euro zone there are many countries that are already paying a negative interest rate yield euro zone counterfeiting is much more pronounced as is japanese counterfeiting then american counterfeiting but as you know maurice we re in an extremely competitive society and we want to finish first at everything even including the debasement of our currency and the consequence of that i think is the very recent strength that you ve seen in gold maurice jackson and may i ask you this as well we all have our favorites but right now what is your favorite gold silver platinum or palladium rick rule for me because i m buying out of cowardice it s gold i don t necessarily think that has the most price upside a speculator might look at silver gold s so called ugly stepchild the silver price moves after the gold price moves but if past is prologue moves further when it does move so a fear buyer would be in the gold trade a greed buyer might be in the silver trade the silver trade is something i probably would have done in my twenties the gold trade is something that i do in my sixties the contrarian of course would be in the platinum space about 60 of world platinum production is uneconomic at present most of it is coming out of south africa a place that has its very own social and political challenges which could disrupt supply note that i said could not will so i think as important as the attributes ascribed to each individual metal are what s more important is the investors needs and perceptions why he or she is doing what they re doing i have other ways to make money which is to say speculate in equities or participate in debt markets for me the principal utility in precious metals is for insurance in effect allowing me to sleep nights and stay calm maurice jackson rick thank you for sharing your golden nuggets of wisdom let s switch gears here on the 29th of july through the 2nd of august the sprott natural resource symposium will be held at the historic fairmont hotel in beautiful downtown vancouver british columbia rick introduce us to this world class event and who will be some of the featured speakers at the symposium rick rule well it s going to be in all humility a spectacular event nomi prins will be speaking you know she s a veteran financial commentator a veteran banker an investment banker danielle dimartino booth formally from the dallas fed will be speaking we re bringing back of course jim rickards doug casey steve sjuggerud alexander green many of the gurus that have traditionally been so well received in the mining space but the part of the conference that i actually like the most is we ll have a lot of speakers from the industry in particular speakers who have passed the pareto s law test speakers who have built multibillion dollar mining businesses from scratch people whose experience building businesses has allowed them to become successful speculators too and hearing from a business builder what he or she thinks are the important characteristics of success in the mining business is invaluable hearing robert friedland who is the most successful exploration speculator of my generation talk about the process of making money in exploration hearing ross beaty who has built 14 successful mining companies talk about how you build a successful mining company that s really where the rubber meets the road another thing we re doing this year since all the guys i ve talked about before are of my vintage approaching or past their sell by date is we re bringing in some people in their thirties and forties who have already exhibited success and who we suspect will be the mining titans of the future so that investors can get to know the people who will make them as successful over the next 20 or 30 years as i ve been in the past 20 or 30 years a lot of the success maurice to people ascribed to me is really a consequence of my having identified and hung onto the lundins the ross beatys the robert friedlands the bob quartermains the clive johnsons of the world it s important that speculators and investors your age and younger find that next generation of superstar entrepreneurs and we ve tried to do the dirty work for people by assembling as many of the high quality youngsters as we can in one place the other thing that s really useful i think maurice is that you re going to have 600 high net worth investors in one location the idea that all of the knowledge in the room emanates from the dias is ridiculous there are a lot of experienced investors there including many mining industry professionals and interacting with your peers listening to the questions that they ask in workshops watching the way that they react to presentations is useful finally an important difference between our conference and every other conference that we know of is that our attendees have told us that the exhibitors at our conference aren t advertisers which is how they re regarded at most conferences that they are in fact investment opportunities or content the consequence is that if you are a public company exhibitor at the sprott conference you need to be owned in a sprott managed account in other words they have been vetted by us that doesn t unfortunately guarantee that every stock goes up but it does say that we know enough about every exhibitor that we have our own capital at risk in them which i think is really important criterion and finally maurice if i can continue this commercial it is possible to have fun in vancouver you ve been there you can attest to this vancouver is a beautiful city the weather in late july early august is sublime any investor who comes up there and doesn t go on the attendee boat cruise with us needs his or her head examined the hotel itself is within walking distance of 200 restaurants and vancouver s an amazingly scenic city with mountains rising above 6 000 feet from sea level right in front of you and an embarcadero a walkway along the water where you will hear six or seven or 10 different languages spoken it s truly a spectacular place and i think it s going to be difficult this year not to make money as a consequence of attending the conference maurice jackson ladies and gentlemen this is truly a world class event as rick just shared to purchase admission to the sprott natural resource symposium visit our home page and simply click on the icon and you ll be forwarded directly to the registration tab we touched on philosophy earlier a day after the symposium you ll be speaking at capitalism and morality founded by a mutual friend of ours jayant bhandari i love the timing of the events rick for someone new to capitalism and morality what would you like to share rick rule well it s more philosophically oriented capitalism and morality is a lot of fun the adrian days and the doug caseys and the maurice jacksons and the rick rules of the world talking about issues that are mostly unrelated to money i m going to be very amused this year to be involved in public debate with my friend jayant bhandari who is you know of indian descent and who is of course a viciously anti indian racist a white guy accusing a brown guy of racism at a public forum is only something that could occur in a libertarian or anarcho capitalist event i think it s going to be a lot of fun not merely for that but for people who have a philosophical or political interest capitalism and morality is wonderful value maurice jackson to register for capitalism and morality simply visit our home page and right below the sprott symposium you ll be directed to the registration tab sir before we close you referenced earlier a free

regional integration was the theme of this year s african development bank summit held in malabo equatorial guinea intra african trade is still only 18 of the continent s total compared to 70 for europe the annual gathering discussed how this figure could be scaled up report by tom collins after annual general meetings agms in india and south korea the african development bank afdb returned to africa this year to convene its 54th annual meeting in equatorial guinea s capital city of malabo under the theme of regional integration for africa s economic prosperity the four day event brought together members of government the private sector and development institutions to discuss harmonising cross border interactions across the continent despite 24 countries having ratified the long awaited african continental free trade area which will usher in a 3 3 trillion zero tariff trade area when rolled out across the continent the bank s president akinwumi adesina kicked off the forum by illustrating the scale of work left to be done in europe regional trade amounts to 70 of the total in asia it is 60 and in africa it is only 18 adesina told a press conference before the official opening the low level of intra african trade is a major stumbling block to africa s development aspirations and more must be done to retain wealth on the continent he said apart and divided africa is weakened together and united africa will be unstoppable pulling down non tariff barriers alone will spur trade by at least 53 and potentially double trade in line with its strategic high 5s agenda light up and power africa feed africa industrialise africa integrate africa and improve the quality of life for people in africa the afdb has been working to strengthen regional integration across the continent up to 1bn has been invested in trade finance together with 1bn invested in the bank s partner afreximbank which specialises in intra african trade as an import export bank according to adesina 630m has also been invested in two south african banks firstrand and absa in order to support the expansion of access to trade finance for 20 countries digital finance initiative on the sidelines of the meeting the bank launched the africa digital financial inclusion facility adfi together with its partners the bill melinda gates foundation the government of luxembourg and the french development agency the agence française de développement afd pierre guislain afdb vice president for private sector infrastructure and industrialisation said the goal is to ensure that at least 320m more africans of whom nearly 60 are women have access to digital financial services africa has enjoyed a surge in mobile phone ownership and internet access which includes a suite of financial technology products however although rates vary drastically between countries as well as between urban and rural demographics it is estimated that only 43 of adults across the continent have access to a bank account the fund will deploy 400m by 2030 to scale up access to electronic financial services for low income communities financial inclusion achieved through digital financial service models is simultaneously a powerful anti poverty strategy and a catalyst of sustainable economic development for national and regional economies said michael wiegand director of the financial services for the poor strategy at the bill melinda gates foundation at the launch the fund s opening project and pilot for the facility is a 11 3m grant from the gates foundation to the afdb and the central bank of west african states other tangible outcomes from the meetings include 17m worth of pledges made by dignitaries to replenish the africa solidarity trust fund astf an initiative which aims to provide food security and eliminate rural poverty on the continent the pledges were made at a high level donor round table convened by the united nations food and agriculture organisation fao and equatorial guinea president obiang nguema mbasogo who said the fund was a turning point in the fight against food insecurity the fund received inaugural contributions of 30m from equatorial guinea and 10m from angola and has to date mobilised funds in malawi mali niger and liberia jennifer blanke afdb vice president of agriculture human and social development said africa faces challenges in the area of agriculture and food production relying heavily on food imports it s so important that astf is showing that african countries are contributing to africa that links very closely to what we are doing she said funding key initiatives out of the total 17m raised 10m was given by angola 2 6m from china 2m 2 27m from france 2m from equatorial guinea and 100 000 from zimbabwe switzerland also signed two agreements with the bank amounting to 3 2m swiss francs 3 7m in order to help fund two key initiatives the entrepreneurship lab e lab for innovative young entrepreneurs and the urban and municipal development fund for africa umdf which helps african cities plan and manage urban growth and climate resilient development by improving governance and basic services these days it s important that partners work together to put talents together in a complementary fashion these are two areas which are forward leaning and positive for the african continent said raymund furrer bank governor for switzerland who signed the agreements on the behalf of his country the e lab will run as a pilot in côte d ivoire kenya ghana nigeria and south africa and is expected to provide young entrepreneurs with financing technical assistance and broader ecosystem support through incubators accelerators and fund managers the initiative was launched through a partnership with the afdb and european investment bank and is part of the bank s broader strategy of creating 25m jobs by 2025 central africa push the meetings are also expected to draw dividends for africa s least developed region central africa in 2018 the gdp growth rate in central africa doubled to 2 2 from 1 1 in 2017 but remained below the sub saharan average of 3 5 with many countries suffering due to poor market access and paltry cross border trade according to afdb s economic outlook for 2019 unveiled at the malabo meetings east africa topped the rankings by growing 5 7 in 2018 with a predicted growth of 5 9 in 2019 and 6 1 in 2020 the report estimated growth across the continent at 4 for this year climbing to 4 1 in 2020 policy recommendations which may boost growth by up to 4 5 of total gdp include removing bilateral tariffs keeping rules of origin simple and transparent removing all non tariff barriers on goods and services and implementing the world trade organisation s trade facilitation agreements along with equatorial guinea the central africa region includes angola cameroon the cental african republic chad democratic republic of congo drc gabon republic of congo and são tomé and príncipe which together with rwanda and burundi make up the economic community of central african states eccas the economic and monetary community of central africa cemac is a separate organisation which includes cameroon the central african republic chad republic of congo and equatorial guinea who share the central african cfa franc the region has a low level of integration in comparison with the east african community eac and the southern african development community sadc it is also hamstrung by a mix of ongoing security issues most notably in eastern drc and the lake chad insurgency which is spreading instability to surrounding chad cameroon and nigeria speaking at the closing ceremony adesina described such locations as existing within the triangle of disaster where unemployment poverty and environmental degradation give rise to serious threat whenever you find these three factors you will also find instability he said he noted that the afdb had invested 30bn in the region over the last seven years specific projects include leveraging norwegian and british money for the congo basin forest fund to reduce the rate of deforestation for its surrounding 80m inhabitants and financing a road corridor to link brazzaville with the central african republic and chad this region is endowed with arable land forest water and abundant diversity making it easily one of the world s leading regions for natural resources he commented equatorial guinea s new finance minister cesar mba abogo said it is a real privilege to host the bank s annual meetings the bank s high 5s are very much in line with our development strategy between now and 2025 he applauded the bank s commitment to the subregion and said it was a great opportunity to strengthen development gains the celebration of these annual assemblies is crucial and the region which will benefit the most is our subregion of central africa he said we are opening and promoting our subregion as part of a high level panel equatorial guinea s president obiang was joined on stage by his central african counterpart drc president felix tshisekedi along with the king of lesotho letsie iii and the prime minister of eswatini ambrose mandvulo dlamini all subscribed to boosting regional integration as a means to development across the continent tshisekedi who is on a charm offensive as the new president on the block said his country s great power potential could help speed up the process of industrialisation and therefore integration economic growth also needs to be achieved through industrialisation but for industrialisation to become a reality we need to have power he said if the inga dam site in my country were developed to its full capacity then this could be the solution for the energy problem in africa the drc president however stressed that for integration through trade to succeed there must first be peace on the continent adesina to seek re election as well as galvanising partners to invest in central africa and more broadly across regional integration adesina used the meeting as an opportunity to lobby shareholders for an afdb general capital increase and to announce his intention to run for re election as the bank s president in 2020 he told reporters at the closing press ceremony that he is seeking to renew his presidency when his first term comes to an end i will run again to continue the work we started he said the afdb president is elected by its board of governors who are made up of appointed representatives from the bank s 80 member countries with voting power proportionate to their capital subscription the vote takes place during the annual meeting closest to the end of the serving president s term having replaced rwandan economist donald kaberuka on 1 september 2015 adesina will seek re election during the bank s next annual meetings at its headquarters in abidjan côte d ivoire of the afdb s 54 african and 26 non african members nigeria the united states japan egypt and south africa have the greatest share of the vote in that order nigeria where adesina formerly served as minister of agriculture and rural development holds the greatest proportion at 9 281 of the total assessing his term in office adesina said don t focus on what we say but focus on what we do the president pointed to key metrics such as connecting 16m people to power 70m farmers to technology and 55m people to clean water and sanitation these are some of the achievements but i can tell you that there are still many miles to cover he commented maintaining the bank s aaa rating since he joined adesina has added to its ability to raise earn and spend capital according to the latest figures released at the conference the bank has generated 2 5bn since 2010 last year the bank earned 214m in income 48 of which was reinvested back into the institution to reinforce reserves and boost business growth in 2017 8 8bn in loans and other assistance was disbursed for development purposes across the continent the bank is now pursuing its seventh capital increase the first since the one approved in 2010 by its governors who act as shareholders the decision is set to be made in october during an extraordinary assembly as bank representatives argue more capital is needed to extend the bank s services as a sign of good faith canada which holds 4 64bn worth of afdb shares recently upped its commitment of callable capital or money which can be paid to the bank on request to 1 1bn with adesina earning the moniker of the aaa president the bank s capital increase is expected to be approved some predicting by as much as three times over i am driven by africa so as president of the bank i can tell you this is no chore for me it is a labour of love and i feel truly confident when i see the trust the governors have placed in us he said
karachi the rupee plunged 3 29 percent to a record low against the dollar on wednesday in what appeared to be currency devaluation by the central bank ahead of imf bailout package approval due next month gold price has also soared and business at stock exchange witnessed decline the government has also decided to increase gas and electricity tariffs substantially the rupee closed at 162 16 dollar compared with previous close of 156 98 in the interbank market the rupee weakened rs5 18 dollar during the day the currency was traded as low as 162 25 to the dollar in an intraday trade the rupee weakened rs6 1 to close at rs163 dollar in the open market dealers said the rupee came under renewed pressure and the state bank of pakistan sbp s reticence also fueled speculative onslaught on the battered currency it was another volatile trading day despite a lack of payment pressure a dealer said he said the market expects rupee will face more pressure in coming days as the government is about to get imf approval on 6 billion loan package the imf s board is due to meet on july 3 the economy is going through a familiar boom and bust cycle debt is soaring inflation is rocketing and reserves are falling after a deficit blowout the imf has long advocated pakistan to loosen its grip on the rupee and estimated the real exchange rate was overvalued by as much as 20 percent in 2017 market participants said there are also reports that government has already signed letter of intent and memorandum of economic and financial policies for securing approval of 6 billion loan from the imf s board the rupee is likely to weaken further trading at 180 dollar in the next months said another dealer samiullah tariq director research at brokerage arif habib said dollar recorded increased on back of importers demand and some of the oil payments moreover due to year end closing some of the multinational companies might have buying dollars to repatriate their earnings to their principles the rupee has lost more than 50 percent of its value since december 2017 stoking inflation and becoming the worst performance asian currency reuters quoting sbp reported that the central bank said it was watching the foreign exchange market closely and would act in the case of unwarranted volatility it said the recent slide reflects the continuing resolution of accumulated imbalances of the past and some role of supply and demand factors the sbp governor earlier this month defended the market based exchange rate system that he said staved off external finance risks in the past couple of months governor reza baqir in his first press brief reiterated the central bank s resolve to intervene in the market to check excessive volatility and disorderly conditions he said currently market based system is implemented in pakistan which protects exchange rate from manipulation and simultaneously follows demand and supply mechanism neither fixed not free float regime of exchange rate is good for pakistan as former can lead to external imbalance and latter can lead to manipulation governor viewed meanwhile the economic coordination committee ecc of the cabinet extended conditional

pursuant to section 8 3 of the ogra ordinance 2002 ogra in its latest decision dated may 17 2019 has determined the estimated revenue requirement of sngpl rs 293 305 billion and ssgcl rs270 776 billion for the fy 2019 20 accordingly a net revenue requirement after adjusting other income regarding sngpl is rs277 913 billion and ssgcl rs263 247 billion current gas sale prices would result in a net revenue shortfall of rs87 630 billion and rs56 803 billion respectively to meet the projected revenue shortfall ogra has also recommended category wise prescribed prices to be made effective from july 1 2019 and recommended 31 percent and 20 percent across the board increase in gas sale prices for all categories of consumers of sngpl and ssgc respectively except domestic sector where the suggested increase illustrates an approach towards rationalisation of domestic tariff based on indexation of each slab tariff with weighted average prescribed price cost of supply
donald trump is taking the global economy to the edge of hell in a handbasket and his meeting with xi jinping during the g20 in osaka will only provide temporary relief led by russia and china central banks throughout the world are dumping us treasury bonds and buying more gold than at any time since 2013 as a result of trump s recklessness the us will soon lose its exorbitant privilege of reduced borrowing costs due to the greenback being the global reserve currency of choice that is what many trump haters but also eminent bankers and economists are saying but they are wrong let s put aside the compelling argument that it is china s illegitimate and even illegal economic practices on a large scale which poses the greater danger to the stability of the global economic system for another day the likelihood is economic disruption and uncertainty will only further entrench america s exorbitant privilege neither the euro renminbi nor gold will replace the greenback in any meaningful sense first the numbers the share of global reserves in us dollars might have fallen in 2018 but that is occurring from a dominantly high base at the end of 2018 about 62 per cent of global reserves were in us dollars compared to around 20 per cent 5 per cent and 2 per cent in euros japanese yen and rmb respectively it is a similar story for international debt with just under two thirds in us dollars compared to 22 per cent in euros in second place gold reserves a secret does chinese buying of gold signal a sea change coming perhaps even intention to convert the rmb to the gold standard not really china usually keeps its gold reserves a secret although it did reveal that it held 1658 metric tonnes of gold last july up from about 600 tonnes in 2009 which was when it last released official holdings most experts who follow gold mining and purchase movements believe the people s central bank holds around 3000 tonnes at current prices this equates to around us136 billion 195 billion worth this is a hefty figure but small compared to the us3 2 trillion or so it holds in foreign exchange reserves to hold that amount of value in gold it would need more than 500 000 tonnes of the stuff gold miners tell me that is more than two and the half times more than has been mined in the history of the world for china and every other country fiat currency is here to stay the question is which currency will be dominant to answer that question we must return to why the us dollar became the dominant reserve currency in the first place for starters the greenback is fully tradeable on international foreign exchange markets there are no capital controls restricting the purchase or sale of the dollar with the deepest and most developed financial and debt market in the world buying and selling the greenback is easy efficient and transparent paranoid about instability this immediately restricts the capacity of the rmb to assume the role of genuine global currency given its determination to capture national savings and retain central control over the country s deployment of capital beijing is committed to a closed capital account and cannot risk rmb fleeing the country paranoid about instability resulting from the ups and downs of a liberalised economy and resulting fluctuations in the value of its currency it will not allow full convertibility of the rmb nor will the communist party allow the unrestricted issuing of corporate bonds and other forms of private debt preventing the emergence of deep and diverse financial markets inside china under these circumstances why would one buy rmb except to trade directly with or invest in china moreover the global reserve currency serves as a safe store of value and as a way for governments and private entities to park and protect accumulated wealth especially as geo strategic and economic tensions rise globally even those who admire beijing s model would have doubts about the long term security of their capital given the capriciousness and opaqueness of its system and institutions with respect to those former prime ministers politicians ambassadors and businesspeople who regularly spruik the superiority of its authoritarian political economy i doubt any of them would permanently park the bulk of their assets in china what about the euro the problem is that the future of the eu is less certain than that of the us what happens after brexit is finally over there are significant anti eu movements in countries such as sweden and the netherlands even if all continental members stay put having observed the trauma that britain is going through the problem for the eu remains it is a common monetary and customs union for a motley bunch of sovereign countries with different institutions attitudes economic policies and standards of living and national debt the us seems a far better long term bet on that account finally what about a new global reserve currency disconnected from individual nations as russia and china first suggested more than a decade ago that would run into the same problems as the eu multiplied by the number of countries encompassed by that pie in the sky idea the bottom line is that the more instability and uncertainty in the era of trump and beyond the more likely the greenback remains the world s pre eminent reserve currency read in financial review
today s highlights us may need to boost inflation with rate cuts commodity currencies get a lift inward investment into uk falls is there a solution current market overview markets are on tenterhooks this morning on tentative optimism for a resolution to the us china trade war markets are hopeful for some sort of agreement following the trump xi summit on saturday 29th june to avoid further escalation in the us china trade tariffs the pound us dollar exchange rate has fallen half a cent from the interbank rate highs of 1 2750 seen yesterday mixed messages from us central bank san francisco federal reserve bank president mary c daly said yesterday that she is uncomfortable with the current direction of inflation and that the coming weeks would be critical for setting the direction of us interest rates she raised concerns about headwinds and discussed how weaker growth could reinforce the rationale for a rate cut however she also argued that monetary policy change could help bring the economy back to potential growth and help reach target inflation this news prompted selling off the japanese yen and swiss franc as the safe haven currency alternatives to the us dollar markets have been turning to this past week and commodities enjoyed a boost better news for commodity currencies on better trade news the australian and new zealand dollars strengthened against the pound at 1 8130 and 1 90 respectively this demonstrates how important trade is to currency markets and the antipodes in particular overshadowing the latest domestic economic data which for new zealand yesterday was definitely disappointing the new zealand anz business confidence index figure dropped to 38 1 in june down from 32 0 the previous month the agriculture and manufacturing sectors have been the worst affected the tone for new zealand business was again uncertain and cautious as the anz noted the outlook for the economy is murky as things stand there is no reason for the economy to fall into a deep hole however they are concerned the economy is facing credit and cost headwinds and the global outlook is deteriorating also benefitting from rising commodity costs the canadian dollar bounced last night on increasing oil prices uk conservative leader candidate contemplates cuts meanwhile in the uk jeremy hunt has proposed a corporation tax cut and an increase in the cut off where uk workers start to pay national insurance he has also put forward raising defence spending and cutting interest on student debt mr hunt s campaign said the pledges were designed to turbocharge the economy attracting inward investment and driving growth this was well timed as yesterday s figures from the department for international trade dit show a sharp decline in international investment into the uk over the past few years according to recent reports the number of new internationally funded projects in the uk fell 14 in 2018 19 job creation also fell by 24
inequality is not a new phenomenon but in recent years it has reemerged as a social and political flash point in advanced economies and beyond stoking public dissatisfaction perspectives about inequalityâ what it is how it is evolving and how to address itâ are polarized at times even the data used to support arguments are contested in inequality a persisting challenge and its implications pdfâ 1 5mb we provide a fact base to inform the discussion drawing on a wide range of sources and ongoing mckinsey global institute mgi research we highlight different dimensions of inequality such as inequality of wealth of income of consumption and of opportunity with a particular but not exclusive focus on the g 7 countriesâ canada france germany italy japan the united kingdom and the united statesâ which in many ways are at the epicenter of the challenges around inequality this article an abridged version of the discussion paper is divided into the following sections section 1 in global terms the world has become more equal viewed from a broad perspective inequality is in decline as developing economies led by china and india have considerably narrowed the gap in wealth and income with richer countries since the 1980s higher income countriesâ share of global wealth fell from 80 percent in 2000 to 71 percent in 2014 while the wealth share of middle income countries such as indonesia and mexico rose from 14 percent to 22 percent exhibit 1 1 our prior researchâ shows that emerging economies generally have accounted for about two thirds of the worldâ s gdp growth and more than half of new consumption over the past 15 years the convergence can also be seen within the 36 member organisation for economic co operation and development oecd the consumption expenditure gap between g 7 and low spending oecd countries has halved since 2000 section 2 in advanced economies economic outcomes are becoming more unequal inequality within many advanced countries is moving in the opposite direction from the global trend of declining inequality between countries in g 7 economies and across many but not all advanced economies wealth and income inequality in general has been rising since the 1980s it is important to provide nuance and context to this blanket statement within inequality there is a hierarchy of sorts the distribution of wealth among the population is substantially more unequal than the distribution of income which in turn is more unequal than the distribution of consumption based on consumption expenditure for example in 2014 the wealthiest 1 percent of people in g 7 countries owned about 27 percent of the total wealth that was double the 13 percent share of total income that went to the top 1 percent of income earners in the same countries that year within inequality there is a hierarchy of sorts the distribution of wealth among the population is substantially more unequal than the distribution of income which in turn is more unequal than the distribution of consumption based on consumption expenditure in the oecd wealth inequality has risen since 2000 on average in two thirds of the member countries as measured by the ratio of mean to median wealth not all countries march in lockstep inequality as measured by the wealth gini coefficient grew significantly in countries affected by the financial crisis such as ireland eastern european economies such as latvia and slovenia and some of the most developed economies including switzerland and the united states meanwhile inequality improved in belgium poland and sweden in france the united kingdom and the united states the g 7 countries for which data are most readily available the share of wealth for the top 1 percent rose rapidly from 20 percent in 1990 to 27 percent in 2000 the rise subsequently tapered off with the share of wealth of this top cohort remaining around 27 percent by 2014 in income terms too inequality has become more pronounced the pretax income share of the top 1 percent in the oecd doubled from 6 percent in 1980 to around 11 percent in 2014 similarly income inequality as measured by the gini coefficient of post tax disposable income has been mostly rising since the 1980s albeit at different levels across g 7 countries exhibit 2 2 in g 7 countries equality of opportunity continues to depend heavily on personal attributes or endowments such as gender age ethnicity family background and place of residence people in g 7 countries on average attain tertiary education degrees more frequently today than they did ten years ago although some educational outcomes in literacy and numeracy have been declining about 50 percent of women had attained tertiary degrees in 2017 compared with 42 percent of men womenâ s average net income nonetheless continues to trail menâ s at 84 cents for every 1 a man earns although the gap is narrowing for people between the ages of 25 and 35 the story is similar at the same age their now older peers earned more than they do even though the younger generation is considerably better educated section 3 economic realities and views about inequality differ widely across g 7 countries inequality is complex and polarizing as an idea and has been the subject of fierce debate throughout history since the enlightenment in 17th century europeâ and especially todayâ the discussion has been marked by a lack of consensus about the extent of inequality how it is measured and what levels of inequality are optimal or appropriate at the heart of the debate are differing viewpoints shaped by culture history and ideology as well as economic and social trade offs is inequality inevitable and even useful or is it fundamentally bad to what extent can inequality be offset by greater opportunity and innovation and are these notions mutually exclusive at the heart of the debate are differing viewpoints shaped by culture history and ideology as well as economic and social trade offs is inequality inevitable and even useful or is it fundamentally bad to what extent can inequality be offset by greater opportunity and innovation and are these notions mutually exclusive some economists and social scientists argue that inequalities of wealth income and consumption can harm economic growth in the long run by hindering educational opportunities human capital formation and intergenerational mobility growing inequality is seen by some economists as a signal of excessive monopoly power rent seeking or activities with negative externalities and adverse effects on economic performance moreover when incomes go mostly to those at the top some suggest there is little left to motivate people further down the earnings ladder one economist in the 1970s arthur okun made a celebrated analogy between inequality and a â leaky bucketâ if some people are suffering from thirst while others have plenty of water he argued then water should be transferred to the thirsty people even if the only way to do so is to use a leaky bucket resulting in a loss of efficiency water others argue that these debates would be better served by a focus on economic growth and increasing the absolute size of the economy rather than how the growth is shared in this view inequality is a result and enabler of economic progress driving investment and the willingness to take risks accordingly certain social transfers aimed at redistributing economic gains are viewed as dampening incentives or distortionary where the role of the state could be rolled back such arguments focus on removing structural barriers and targeting high growth rates so that individuals across all parts of the wealth income and consumption distributions can progress such differing perspectives make for a complex debate research suggests that people perceive outcomes arising from choices effort and risk as generally fair moreover during periods of sustained growthâ and when that growth is shared among the broad base of the populationâ social attitudes tend to overlook faster growth of income in top quintiles according to some research however inequality can flare up as a point of contention and contestation during periods of slow progress if the wealthiest or highest earners continue advancing while others are squeezed this is exacerbated when inequality is associated with treatment for example by employers or justice systems such debates have heated up since the 2008 financial crisis as incomes have stagnated in g 7 and other advanced economies a plethora of new research into causes and solutions has attracted public attention mgiâ s recent work on economic resilience in europeâ demonstrates the existence of very different social contract models across countries with some more or less egalitarian in the creation and distribution of economic value the economic situation in individual g 7 countries across a range of indicatorsâ including inequalities of income wealth and consumption as well as more general economic measuresâ can vary considerably exhibit 3 3 when it comes to inequalities of opportunity the percentage difference in median earnings by gender covers a range from 6 to 25 percent across g 7 economies variations in measures of social mobility are less pronounced with managers being 2 2 times more likely to come from a family of managers in one country versus 1 8 times more likely in another further citizensâ beliefs are not correlated with specific economic outcomes across g 7 countries this suggests that citizen discontent is influenced by a range of both economic and noneconomic factors there is also considerable variation in relative poverty levels before and after taxes due to policy choices for example france and germany move from the highest pretax poverty levels to the lowest following social transfers on average transfers brought the gini coefficient for income inequality in the g 7 in 2016 down from 0 49 pretax to 0 32 thereafter the reductions were particularly significant in germany and the united kingdom and smaller in japan and the united states exhibit 4 4 section 4 growing inequality has left many people behind economic disruptions and the widening of inequality over the past several decades have affected large segments of the population in g 7 countries wages have stagnated for many male employment has declined and the economy may have become more fragile as market incomes increasingly fail to lift people out of poverty at the same time the cost of basic goods and services such as education and healthcare has risen faster than overall inflation average real wages have grown in five of the g 7 countries since the financial crisis in 2008 but in italy and the united kingdom they have fallen real net income has declinedâ for 25 percent of individuals in six of the g 7 economies excluding japan since 2005 for 60 percent of the population disposable income has risen faster for people in the next richest income decile than it has for them households as well as individuals have felt the impact our research has shown that market incomes were flat or fellâ for around 70 percent of households in advanced economies in 2014 compared to similar households in 2005 although government taxes and transfers reduced the impact on disposable income for many in the united states the share of adults living in middle income households declined from 61 percent in 1971 to just 50 percent in 2015 these effects are related to a decline in middle wage jobs across advanced economies over the past three decades in the united states for example the share of adults living in middle income households declined from 61 percent in 1971 to just 50 percent in 2015 while about two thirds of this shift has been upwards to upper middle and higher income households one third of those have shifted down to lower middle and the lowest income households creating an hourglass like effect our research on skill shifts and automationâ suggests competition for high skill workers will likely increase while displacement may be concentrated mainly on low skill workers continuing a trend that has exacerbated income inequality and reduced middle wage jobs it has also consolidated or exacerbated disparities of income and other inequalities within the same cities such as washington dc and paris exhibits 5 and 6 5 6 on the employment front average employment in the g 7 has remained broadly stable since the 1980s and employment of the working age population has risen however the employment rate for women has grown sharply by 16 percentage points even as the male employment rate has declined by four points the male employment rate remains higher than the female rate at 76 to 65 percent but the gap has narrowed markedly several indicators point to a growing fragility and precarity in the economy relative poverty rates before taxes on average in the g 7 have risen by seven percentage points from 23 percent of the population in 1985 to almost 30 percent in 2016 transfers and tax reduce that proportion but do not fully compensate on average almost one in seven people living in the most advanced economies remains in relative poverty after taxes and transfers education healthcare and housing costs have all risen since 2002 overall inflation has increased by 36 and 32 percentage points in the united states and in the european union respectively while the nominal price of education has increased by 101 and 77 percentage points healthcare costs have also exceeded inflation in both europe and the united states further increasing financial fragility has been the rise in household indebtedness which jumped from 87 percent of net disposable income in 1995 to 121 percent in 2008 and 123 percent in 2017 income inequality and wage stagnation are causes of particular dissatisfaction almost half of the people polled in 16 advanced economies believe the average person in their country is worse off today than 20 years ago such trends in material living standards have contributed to rising discontent people are not feeling optimistic about the future and their own personal economic situations and surveys show a waning of public trust in governments and other societal institutions in one global survey 60 percent of respondents said they believed their country was â on the wrong track â income inequality and wage stagnation are causes of particular dissatisfaction almost half of the people polled in 16 advanced economies believe the average person in their country is worse off today than 20 years ago section 5 some global trends have contributed to rising inequalities the financial crisis of 2008 and the slow recovery from the recession that followed it left many households exposed beyond cyclical factors long term global trends have also contributed to changing economic outcomes and will likely continue to play out in coming years the declining labor share of national income has been driven by structural changes in advanced economies since 1980 its causes and effects are widely debated in the literature with some evidence that it contributes to wage stagnation our recent research focusing on the capital share of incomeâ suggests that boom bust cycles and rising capital depreciation have played a significant role the largest declines have been in france germany and especially spain where the labor share has dropped by 12 percentage points since the 1980s the united states has seen a 5 percent decline in the labor share since 1980 three quarters of that decrease occurred since 2000 collective wage bargainingâ often via unionsâ has declined in both the g 7 and the oecd putting employees in a weaker position in negotiating wage increases moreover labor productivity growth is near historic lowsâ in the united states and much of western europe skills requirements for workers will likely change as machines increasingly complement the work of humans digitization and automation are frequently cited as factors in the declining labor share of income and they pose other profound challenges in the workplace scenarios we have developedâ for the effect of automation and artificial intelligence ai adoption on the global workforce suggest that in most cases the jobs displaced by automation and others created by new labor demand including from rising productivity as a result of technical change could be approximately in balance in many advanced countries however significant workforce transitions could occur in the short to medium term occupations in some sectors will decline while in others they will rise skills requirements for workers will likely change as machines increasingly complement the work of humans with basic cognitive skills no longer sufficing for many jobs while demand for technological and social and emotional skills rises a similar trend is occurring in connection with cities and job locations changing dynamics in the business world also affect workers over the past 20 years 70 percent of gdp and gross surplus gains across g 20 countries have accrued to a handful of economic activities including finance real estate tech pharma and some business services this drives strong wealth effects in the form of gains to holders of physical assets real estate and intangible assets while these sectors tend to be light on labor high skill workers associated with these activities see gains moreover the search for assets in these sectors fuels geographically concentrated searches for talent ip and other intangible assets that reinforce the gains to these locations contributing to the growth of â superstarâ cities that are gateways of finance tech and innovation activity and which are pulling away from peer cities in terms of income growth the impact also contributes to a bifurcation of growth prospects within superstar cities which have some of the highest levels of urban inequality among the worldâ s cities finally global integration is leading to higher competition in the labor market in advanced economies research over the last several decades suggests that this is playing a part in the narrowing wage gap between workers in advanced and developing economies while contributing to increasing domestic income inequality the growing prosperity of developing economies at times propelled by dynamic large companies is also raising the competitive stakes for firms in advanced economies these emerging market firms now play a large role on the global stage while they accounted for only about 25 percent of the total revenue and net income of all large public companies in 2016 they contributed about 40 percent of the revenue growth and net income growth from 2005 to 2016 nonetheless globalization is not static changing value chains the growth of regional trade reduced labor cost arbitrage and other factors may affect this dynamic in the future section 6 new consensus will be needed to improve economic inclusion both old and new measures and interventions may be needed to counter disparities and strengthen inclusive growth given the wide range of views and differing economic situation in g 7 countries no single solution is likely to fit all new consensus will need to be found among policy makers business leaders civil society organizations and citizens to enact meaningful change any such consensus will need to be built on a national level given the broad divergences among countries on the issue multilateral cooperation may also be needed especially relating to trade and tax policies in this final section we do not make specific recommendations but rather provide a scope of solutions based on an in depth analysis of more than 350 initiatives being proposed and piloted in g 7 countries economic growth has been the central mechanism to deliver broad based prosperity abundant literature covers aspects of this imperative including promoting fair and efficient markets nurturing a well balanced economy across geographic areas investing in innovation and infrastructure leveraging monetary policy and increasing the ease of doing business to stimulate growth while balancing the regulatory burden for entrepreneurs business leaders policy makers and other stakeholders have at their disposal a range of actions to improve economic inclusion the ideas being proposed and piloted align with two main pathways for action addressing inequality of opportunities and addressing inequality of outcomes policy makers academics business leaders labor organizations and others are examining ways to widen economic opportunities and improve outcomes for all among other efforts these could include providing access to quality healthcare and education healthcare and education are basic goods that are widely cited as being able to improve economic chances for individuals accessible healthcare will likely be increasingly important as individuals live longer with action needed to address imbalances in health outcomes based on socioeconomic and geographic factors effective primary and secondary education will also be indispensable in a transition period to a more automated future schools may need to adjust their curricula to focus on skills of the future including creativity and complex problem solving alongside a new emphasis on science technology engineering and mathematics stem subjects encouraging innovation in education and expanding vocational training and apprenticeships could help ease transitions into work in a more digital world rethinking work and skills beyond primary and secondary education providing workers with lifelong skills at scale is sometimes seen as the challenge of our generation research suggests that tomorrowâ s workers will need to be adaptable and equipped with both enhanced technical skills and well developed social emotional and higher cognitive skills a number of large companies in europe the united states and asia are implementing large scale â reskillingâ programs for their workforces although they remain the exception some of these efforts start with an attempt to map the existing skills of workers and then project forward to the skills the firms expect they will need efforts being considered also examine issues of fair and adequate compensation opportunities to increase labor market flexibility for more efficient and fluid work transitions and effective ways to support those in nonstandard employment effective primary and secondary education will be indispensable in a transition period to a more automated future schools may need to adjust their curricula to focus on skills of the future including creativity and complex problem solving alongside a new emphasis on science technology engineering and mathematics stem subjects addressing biases and discrimination while promoting diversity and inclusion targeted action to ensure that all individuals are given a fair chance regardless of background or personal attributes is among the ideas being tested efforts include supporting underrepresented groups not only through antidiscrimination policies and frameworks but through a diversity and inclusion agenda that can also serve as a source of competitive advantage other approaches suggested to widen inclusion include improving citizen or employee representation potentially on corporate boards or by encouraging forms of labor management cooperation employing new metrics and incentives to encourage social value creation further efforts to encourage and enable capital owners to deploy their capital for social good for example through outcome based funds are widely discussed many call for improvements in the measurement of economic and social value created by companies what investors prioritize how business is taught at business schools and how national success is defined including focusing on metrics of inclusion or well being beyond gdp solving for how economic gains are shared discussions of economic inequality frequently coincide with debates on tax and transfer models leading thinkers from within government the private and social sectors and academia are proposing ideas for how to alter or introduce new forms of taxation to achieve greater fairness or effectiveness designing social assistance for the modern age transfer models in advanced economies are seen by some as ripe for updating for a world of automation and workforce transitions ideas being considered include rethinking employment benefits providing better support to individuals in times of hardship or old age facilitating greater prosperity among younger generations and fundamentally rethinking social assistance through cash transfer programs inequality is not a condition that can be eradicated but its rise can be dulled or reversed and its causes and outcomes addressed for all the differing views inequality is a social and political issue that is both unpredictable and potentially volatile for policy makers business leaders and other stakeholders the current climate of mistrust and waning confidence in institutions creates a new urgency to work together to build social consensus and find effective solutions for a more inclusive future
karachi the rupee plunged by 3 29 percent to a record low against the dollar on wednesday in what appeared to be currency devaluation by the central bank ahead of the imf bailout package approval due next month gold price has also soared and business at the stock exchange also witnessed a decline the government has also decided to increase gas and electricity tariffs substantially the rupee closed

fueledspeculative onslaught on the battered currency it was another volatile trading day despite a lack of payment pressure a dealer said he said the market expects rupee will face more pressure in coming days as the government is about to get imf approval on 6 billion loan package the imf s board is due to meet on july 3 the economy is going through a familiar boom and bust cycle debt is soaring inflation is rocketing and reserves are falling after a deficit blowout the imf has long advocated pakistan to loosen its grip on the rupee and estimated the real exchange rate was overvalued by as much as 20 percent in 2017 the market participants said there are also reports that government has already signed letter of intent and memorandum of economic and financial policies for securing approval of 6 billion loan from the imf s board the rupee is likely to weaken further trading at 180 to a dollar in the next few months said another dealer samiullah tariq director research at brokerage arif habib said dollar recorded increase on back of importers demand and some of the oil payments moreover due to year end closing some of the multinational companies might have been purchasing dollars to repatriate their earnings to their principles the rupee has lost more than 50 percent of its value since december 2017 stoking inflation and becoming the worst performance asian currency reuters quoting sbp reported that the central bank said it is watching the foreign exchange market closely and would act in the case of unwarranted volatility it said the recent slide reflects the continuing resolution of accumulated imbalances of the past and some role of supply and demand factors the sbp governor earlier this month defended the market based exchange rate system that he said staved off external finance risks in the past couple of months governor reza baqir in his first press briefing reiterated the central bank s resolve to intervene in the market to check excessive volatility and disorderly conditions he said currently market based system is implemented in pakistan which protects exchange rate from manipulation and simultaneously follows demand and supply mechanism neither fixed not free float regime of exchange rate is good for pakistan as the former can lead to external imbalances and the latter can lead to manipulation governor viewed meanwhile the economic coordination committee ecc of the cabinet extended conditional approval for hiking the gas tariff up to 191 percent and average power rates by rs1 49 per unit for consumers using over 300 units with second increase in the power tariff in the last six months the government will generate rs190 billion from the consumers the government hiked the electricity tariff by rs1 27 per unit in january 2019 the ecc granted its approval and now the final approval would be sought from the federal cabinet before implementing this decision the ecc also decided to withdraw rs3 per unit for export oriented sectors with the condition that the subsidy will continue for peak hours the government has accomplished almost all prior actions agreed with the imf staff except one more action pending which will be fulfilled soon pakistan will have to fulfill all conditions before tabling pakistan s request in front of imf s executive board scheduled to meet at washington dc on july 3 for approving 6 billion under 39 months extended fund facility eff a new wave of inflation is going to hit the country with start of next fiscal year during which the administrative hike in utility prices such as gas and electricity devaluation of rupee against dollar that had touched from rs157 to rs163 in a single day increased taxation rates and possibility of surge in pol prices with effect from july 1 will push price hike making lives of common man of the country more miserable a top official of finance division confirmed that the electricity tariff will be increased by rs1 49 per unit while the government protected power consumers using 300 units on monthly basis the government allocated rs216 billion subsidy for protecting the vulnerable segments from hike in power tariff in fiscal year 2019 20 starting from july 1 the government claims that there would be no increase for 40 percent consumers for initial slabs according to official statement issued by finance ministry

cabinet under chairmanship of adviser to pm on finance dr abdul hafeez shaikh here on wednesday approved gas prices up to 191 percent after protecting lifeline consumers the summary states that the natural gas price hike will become effective from july 1 2019 the two gas utility companies viz sui northern gas pipelines limited sngpl and sui southern gas company limited ssgcl are engaged in gas purchase from exploration and production e p companies and transmission distribution and sale thereof to various categories of consumers they are operating on cost plus return on assets formulae under licences from oil and gas regulatory authority ogra under this regime and in accordance with section 1 of ogra ordinance 2002 revenue requirements of the two companies are determined by ogra which mainly comprise i well head gas price ii transmission distribution cost and iii profit margin presently 17 43 percent return on assets before financial charges and taxes the per unit revenue requirement rupees per million btu is defined as prescribed price based on revenue requirements ogra pursuant to section 8 1 of the ogra ordinance 2002 advises category wise prescribed prices for various categories of consumers which forms the basis for the federal government in determining the category wise gas sale price for each category of consumer pursuant to section 8 3 of the ogra ordinance 2002 ogra in its latest decision dated may 17 2019 has determined the estimated revenue requirement of sngpl rs 293 305 billion and ssgcl rs270 776 billion for the fy 2019 20 accordingly a net revenue requirement after adjusting other income regarding sngpl is rs277 913 billion and ssgcl rs263 247 billion current gas sale prices would result in a net revenue shortfall of rs87 630 billion and rs56 803 billion respectively to meet the projected revenue shortfall ogra has also recommended category wise prescribed prices to be made effective from july 1 2019 and recommended 31 percent and 20 percent across the board increase in gas sale prices for all categories of consumers of sngpl and ssgc respectively except domestic sector where the suggested increase illustrates an approach towards rationalisation of domestic tariff based on indexation of each slab tariff with weighted average prescribed price cost of supply
interview moscow allafrica s juanita williams was in moscow for the african export import bank afreximbank meetings one of the preludes to the october 24 russia africa summit in sochi co chaired by president of the russian federation vladimir putin and president of egypt abdel fattah el sisi who also heads the african union agreements on trade economic and investment are expected to be signed following the high level forum where dozens of african heads of state will participate afreximbank s decision to hold their meetings and agm outside of the continent for only the second time the first time was in china was driven by a vision to push forward a new agenda for africa as the bank s president professor benedict oramah said at the opening the russian federation represents one of such partners that africa looks up to said oramah allafrica spoke with afreximbank s chief economist and director of research and international cooperation dr hippolyte fofack excerpts why is it important to have the afreximbank meetings here in russia you heard the nigerian speaker permanent secretary of the political and economic affairs office of nigeria gabriel tanimu aduda this morning june 20 saying that for the second time after china russia became a shareholder of the bank last year and they injected a lot of money in the bank they ve also seen what the bank is doing the role that afreximbank is playing in supporting development and trade within the african continent so they ve decided to partner with us and join us for economic transformation in africa and expressed an interest in hosting our annual general meeting in russia we felt that given the role and the vision they have for 2019 russia made 2019 the russia africa year you heard minister lavrov russian foreign minister sergey lavrov saying that what we have this week it s just the first step towards the russia africa summit in october where we are expecting more than 40 heads of state it s a very important year in that relationship and we are playing our part to make sure that africans are introduced to russia and africa is also able to reflect on the russia africa relationship as you know being from southern africa russia played a major role in the liberation of this continent whether it be angola or south africa and something happened after the collapse of the soviet union and one can understand that they were in search of their own soul in a difficult world now they seem to have stabilized and the old russia is resurging again it s not a bad thing to be part of that journey our research clearly shows that what has helped africa over the last 20 years has been diversifications of its trade partners it used to be said when europe sneezes africa catches a cold then more than 50 of africa trade if not 70 was with europe you all saw the euro fiscal and financial crisis europe was suffering but africa was growing in part because africa south trade today is way above africa trade with europe and china and india alone today account for 23 of total african trade if you add intra african trade at 16 you already at almost 39 40 you can see things are changing as russia comes on stream that share of africa south trade will expand even more and ultimately reduce africa s exposure to global volatility what are your thoughts on what could be described as the backlash against the continent s involvement with china and russia i have seen a few articles about how colonisation has been started once again with china with rising interest and involvement from russia on the continent the same ideas about russia and africa will be spread i was reading an article on the cnbc last week about russia involvement in africa and they said it was bad for u s interest i think the fundamental question you are raising is one of geopolitics which will intensify even more in the coming years as you heard from dr ha joon chang this morning the global pie is shrinking there are countries which for many years enjoyed global monopoly in terms of technology in terms of trade and the manufacturing sector there was no south now the south is suddenly able to complete when you have not been used to competition it can become very difficult for you to compete and that is a new world in which we are of course people can talk about africa as if africa belongs to them but we are 1 2 billion projected to be 2 5 billion so the continent is coming back after centuries of slavery and colonialism what is happening should be expected it s a historical legacy but i think if you take america going back ha joon chang and china they became a superpower by relying on british technology on german technology there is a very nice book which came out written by a very brilliant and wonderful lady annie jacobsen called operation paperclip she wrote this book about how after wwii america took over all the nazi scientists to build boeing the von braun center in alabama and so that is german technology which went to help america and africa has to be where it needs help if africa needs technology and it s coming from china from russia from america or from the uk from portugal we will take it we need technology africa needs infrastructure to develop it s painful that the chinese are building it but if you do what we just discussed in terms of building the skills engineering skills maybe tomorrow we will be in a joint venture and then after that africa will build their own infrastructure what do you think about the results of the negotiations between companies bankers and entrepreneurs on the african continental free trade agreement the africa we have all known has been a fragmented continent and the processes of fragmenting africa were born out of the berlin conference in the 19th century which created microstates with micro and fragmented markets which over the years has been a key constraint for large scale investment why pour 10 million 20 billion 100 billion dollars investment in a country of less than 1 million if you cannot sell good produce across the board so that has been a major constraint to the development of this continent and precisely why the step taken by the african leaders which started in kigali last year in march 2018 when an overwhelming majority of african countries signed the african continental free trade area afctfa and later on the following months rushed to ratify has been a major historical event in the process of economic development and it s a watershed moment and the african continent because for once we are going to now have market of course the african middle class has been growing but now we have the conditions for it to explode and naturally what would happen is that now we are now going to move away with the right condition from foreign direct investment directed towards natural resources and primary commodity towards a foreign direct investment driven more by a manufacturing industrial productions than in the past and as that is done we will create opportunity for sustainable growth sustainable per capita income increase which is what it takes to help grow that middle class and set it on an irreversible path that will be motivated by economies of scale it will also be motivated by the changing environment in a continent where macroeconomic stability has become the golden rule of policy making it is no longer something that is actually pushed and promoted and fostered from certain institutions it has become part of policy making within the continent i am personally very optimistic about the african continental free trade area and we see the results already two or three months ago germany s volkswagen decided to open a plant to manufacture volkswagen in rwanda in that tiny what they call landlocked economy they are not building the plant for rwanda s market but they will benefit from it i can see them building that factory for tanzania for kenya and so forth as if one was not enough after the german move the french announced two months ago macron that french car manufacturers will be building an assembly plan in kenya next door so the competition for real investment in the manufacturing sector has started mostly triggered by prospects by the continental free trade area agreements you will recall that when we look at intra african trade versus extra african trade why extra african trade imports into africa are essential manufactured goods africa exports to the rest of the world are essentially primary commodities and natural resources but when you look at intra african trade is overwhelmingly industrial products and manufactured goods as we industralise we will also drive intra african trade and where i am very optimistic is that the moment intra african trade rises to above 35 to 40 the issue of payment deficits will no longer be a thorny issue in this continent because we will actually act as an absorber in other words when there s contraction in global demand it will not affect domestic demand within the continent there s been talk about as you said the middle class possibly exploding and moving from being a resource rich continent to focusing on manufacturing and you use of rwanda and kenya as examples they are really good examples but they can been seen as exceptions whereas there are quite a few countries not on the same position as rwanda how will it work with countries like liberia for instance where lack of infrastructure is a challenge and central african republic where peace is an issue that has been one of the concerns about moving the african continental free trade area forward the fact that countries are at different stages in their development process has been viewed as a possible constraint but the provision we have now in the free movement of goods and services will be followed by a new protocol investment and new protocol and free movement of labour so that when the african continent free trade area is at full capacity it will allow people to move to where opportunities are that s the first thing the second thing is that what we have in terms of state failure and institution building and weak state is actually in our view a consequence of the fragmentations we ve had in a continent and as we move towards implementing the continental free trade area agreements there will be space for regional investment if we take the inga dam for instance we have been talking about the inga dam for decades we ve seen south africa s growing interest in the drc because of the possibilities from inga even though inga is not at full capacity so as we move towards the africa free trade area agreement there will be regional investment in strategic sectors infrastructure which will actually create a condition for greater integrations with significant benefits for the smaller states that you just mentioned we can see that happening but that will not be all i think there are some initiatives taken into a short time because when we move towards the continental free trade area there will be short term costs in terms of duties custom duties we are doing working with african union commissions is to establish what we call the african continental free trade area agreement adjustment facility if they are countries that are losing in terms of duties as a result of eliminations on 90 of goods we will provide what is necessary as a stop gap measure but ultimately the growth prospects as such that as kennedy put it so well the rising tide will be able to lift all boats the way things are going editor s note the rising tide will lift all boats is associated with the idea that improvements in the general economy will benefit all participants in that economy the phrase is commonly attributed to john f kennedy who used it in a 1963 speech to combat criticisms that a dam project he was inaugurating what kind of opportunities will arise for companies and banks like afreximbank because interest in foreign investments in africa may drop because there are more markets than in the west that is what we called initially in our oldest discussions the potential benefit associated with economies of scale which are such that where it use to take 100 to buy a book you made bring the cost of that particular book down to 20 and still make a lot of money because of the size of the market so the return investment is going to be significantly much higher and therefore the risk structure of investment within the continent is likely to change that s one important incentive for the investor which cannot be ignored by any bank but the benefits for investors and financial institutions are actually much broader if you look at our current strategy the afreximbank strategic plan the first pillar is what we called the arrowhead is intra african trade if you look at the current forecast it says that within a decade after implementation of the afctfa after the ratification intra african trade could double by doubling the intra african trade you ll be reducing the risk of macroeconomic management challenges so macroeconomic stability and restructure will also change and ultimately reducing the cost of lending what will happen is as the economic environment and growth improves more african countries are going to see much increase in their sovereign rating we have a lot of implications for a bank like afreximbank where the majority of our shareholders are member states we are very happy to have south africa become a shareholder last year because they come with a very good rating which will boost the overall rating of the bank as an institution so we can see the potential ramifications of this continental free trade area in the banking sector

sharing knowledge among countries that are have higher economic ratings and better infrastructure we will make sure that we provide the right advice to countries part of the african continental free trade area on the right policies a set of reforms to fully benefits from the african continental free trade area we have met ambassador muchanga about that and the most important drivers of success will depend on the capacity of african countries and business leaders to increase these spaces of industrial production and manufacturing we did some research recently the intra african export potentials were very high and largely driven by industrial products in the future and to do well in that space in the digital age you have to build the right skills engineering technology innovations to change the structure of african economies that will be the major challenge and something we will be bring to african leaders to make sure that we move into a new era where african education system will be reformed to meet a need and aspirations of the continent if africa s growth in trade intra and extra is as you expect from this new strategy what do you expect relations with china and in future russia will be it s always important when you are looking at relationship to look at this from a dynamic not always static manner the nature of the relationship between europe and america today is not what it used to be 30 or 40 years ago things have changed what has changed is that europe has become economically stronger they even have their own currency now and america is coming to terms with that the relationship between africa and china will go through the same path as we speak the chinese population is ageing the source of growth in china is changing from low tech to medium to high tech so they will have at some point to undergo manufacturing changes and go beyond asia another side is of the coin is independent of china or russia for that matter is that africa s own strategy for far too long we have embraced the world without our own strategy but now we have one in future partnerships including this one with russia we are going to emphasise the technology transfer russia has expertise in the area of energy natural resource management the oil in russia unlike in angola doesn t belong to chevron what can africa learn from that so that the oil in angola is not for chevron or exxon mobil but for an african entity we are going to go to russia with a clear agenda as to what we can get from them and so it is up to us to make sure that that partnership is truly a win win partnership and that the fragmentations of the continent to create a continental africa free trade area will actually make it easier just imagine a moment that we decide to move away from national mining and have a continental strategy for the mining sector whether we increase royalties by 5 10 20 no single country will be targeted because it s a continental strategy the continent and individual countries will be strengthened significantly under the current framework for more on the afreximbank meetings and trade development on the continent go to our business page
itâ s not being widely reported but the gold standard is back at least in russia since the last financial crisis russia has more than quadrupled its gold reserves at least according to official data see the chart below from the world gold council there has long been a buzz especially within the gold investing community that the russians are slowly but surely backing the ruble with gold in a quest to dedollarize putin has come out against the dollar as the international currency reserve for quite some time most recently earlier this month â deep changes require adaptation of international financial organizations reconsidering the role of the dollar which after it became international reserve currency turned into the tool of pressure of the country of issue on the rest of the world today â but just because a country increases its gold reserves that doesnâ t mean that itâ s on a gold standard however in the case of russia it effectively is if we crunch the numbers counting back to just prior to the last financial crisis we find that the rubleâ s gold backing is actually stronger now than it was back then meaning numerically that its gold reserves have risen faster than its total ruble supply in todayâ s age of record central bank money printing this is simply astounding here are the numbers since april 2007 russiaâ s central bankâ s gold reserves have risen from 386 52 tons to 2 119 2 tons thatâ s an increase of 448 over the same time period the ruble supply has risen from rub9 964 3 billion to rub46436 5 billion thatâ s an increase of only 366 much less than the increase in gold reserves to back it below is the russian ruble supply from the st louis fed russiaâ s gold reserves are not the only thing that proves russia is serious about maintaining the value of the ruble overnight interest rates are actually at historical norms at 7 5 that means its bonds actually have a decent yield to them currently at 7 4 further russia has one of the most responsible and conservative fiscal policies in the world debt to gdp is a miniscule 13 5 rising from a low of only 6 5 during the depths of the financial crisis from a technical perspective russian stocks also look very attractive the vaneck vectors russia etf rsx is knocking on the door of 5 year resistance and even at these relatively high prices at least compared to the last 5 years the dividend yield on this etf is a very respectable 4 5 data by ycharts if youâ re looking for a class of equities that stands to benefit from rising inflation in europe and the us russia is one of the best options as sovereign bond yields in the west head more and more into negative territory now at 12 trillion priced below zero and counting once this reverses demand for russian debt securities is likely to rise bringing down russian interest rates while at the same time its currency should be stable given its de facto gold backing what about oil russian stocks are heavily weighted towards oil and so is rsx so a lower oil price could hurt rsx in the short term that said the dividend yield would rise in such a case so scaling in as oil declines would be the best move here as weâ ll see the main companies held by the etf are in good financial shape so dividend cuts are unlikely one could perhaps argue that the united states produces more crude oil than russia so a higher oil price would just as well benefit us stocks so why turn to russia the answer is that since only dollars are accepted for oil a higher oil price means a lower dollar which pushes up the costs of oil production in the us relative to the costs of oil production in russia which would remain relatively stable in ruble terms costs of production would go up but much less than in the us a higher oil price would give russia a windfall and boost both russian equities and the ruble itself lowering the cost of living overall in russia and improving the russian economy true modern economists donâ t believe in this notion but this is the hard money perspective namely that a falling cost of living is better for people and the economy overall going into the individual energy companies held by rsx we can see that they are financially stable with very low leverage gazprom ogzpy has only 4 3 leverage lukoil otc lukoy has almost none this compares to domestic us oil producers like chesapeake chk leveraged nearly 300 these kinds of setups are a natural consequence of us interest rates being so low for so long encouraging enormous amounts of debt while russian rates have been historically normal for so many years conclusion in the near term the oil price depends on tensions between the us and iran that situation may hopefully calm down and the oil price could fall as a result but it may not if it does calm down then the yield on rsx will go even higher and you can buy more rsx eventually oil will recover as it always does and in the meantime you can reinvest dividends a de facto gold backed ruble over the last 12 years very low sovereign debt normal interest rates and a market knocking on significant resistance all point to russia as being a stable growth investment over the next 10 years as monetary uncertainty plagues the west and threatens systemic debt crises
imf advises govt to reduce the sector s vulnerabilities the international monetary fund yesterday advised the government of bangladesh to reduce the vulnerabilities in the banking sector with a view to ensuring sustainable economic growth the government should also create fiscal space to address social needs and infrastructure requirements and diversify the economy by strengthening the business environment and improving governance the washington based multilateral lender said the imf came up with the suggestions at a press conference at the bangladesh bank headquarters in dhaka after a staff team of the institution led by daisaku kihara completed discussions with the government high ups and stakeholders from june 16 to 27 on the 2019 article iv consultation with bangladesh during an article iv consultation an imf team of economists visits a country to assess economic and financial developments and discuss the country s economic and financial policies with government and central bank officials the banking sector has continued to deteriorate in recent years despite strong growth resolutely addressing the high level of default loans is essential to address financial stability risks and associated fiscal risks kihara said liquidity pressure in the banking sector is prevailing and the recovery of default loans will help banks mitigate the problem he said without having efficient channel of finance through banks it is quite difficult to keep gdp growth sustainable as such funding is necessary to promote productive investment the imf called for a comprehensive credible and time bound action plan to strengthen supervision in the banking sector and avoid the regulatory forbearance tighter criteria and limited use of rescheduling and restructuring of loans are also important to strengthen banks it said the authorities should give priority to improve corporate governance and reform the legal system to strengthen creditor rights kihara said government borrowing from the banking sources has increased in recent period because of a fall in revenue collection increasing the tax revenues should be focused on the priority basis kihara said according to the mission chief implementation of the new vat law in the next fiscal year is a step towards modernisation of the tax regime but its revenue impact is uncertain because of multiple rates and implementation challenges the vat and supplementary duty act 2012 was framed in 2011 at the prescription of the imf to boost revenue collection in the country that has the lowest tax gdp ratio in south asia the law had insisted on a uniform 15 percent vat rate on all goods and services save for 15 items but the 15 percent single rate drew the ire of the business community and certain sections of the society whose fervent opposition delayed the implementation of the law several times now in a bid to appease them the government has come up with multiple vat rates of 5 percent 7 5 percent 10 percent and 15 percent the imf continues to encourage the government to follow a single vat rate kihara said a single rate is easier to implement and allows taxpayers to comply tax policy reforms should focus on tax base broadening and ensuring tax compliance the mission chief said according to the imf the organisational structure of the national board of revenue needs to be modernised to improve its coordination and efficiency on the expenditure side a priority remains to improve public investment management through better project appraisal and selection and alignment of public investment priorities with national and sectoral plans the imf also lauded bangladesh s progress the country has succeeded in fostering a dynamic and fast growing economy with significant poverty reduction it said to preserve and build on that achievement diversification into more complex products would spur integration into global value chains and make exports more robust to changes in global demand patterns kihara said economic growth in bangladesh continues to be strong robust private consumption pushed real gdp growth close to 8 percent in the fiscal year of 2017 18 while inflation increased slightly due mainly to higher food prices export growth has picked up recently based on solid performance of the readymade garments sector while remittance inflows have also strengthened this has led to a narrowing of the current account deficit despite higher imports of capital goods macroeconomic performance is set to remain strong in the fiscal 2019 20 with growth projected at above 7 50 percent and inflation close to the central bank s target kihara said improving the business environment and strengthening frameworks to limit vulnerability to corruption would also be fundamental to the realisation of development goals he said monetary policy should also be geared toward containing risks to the inflation outlook stemming from higher global oil prices rapid economic growth and elevated inflation expectations continuous efforts to control the issuance of national savings certificates should support deepening of the capital market and reduce budget interest payments the economist said during its visit the team met with the central bank governor the finance secretary the chairman of the nbr as well as members of parliament representatives of the business and banking sectors leaders of labour unions and think tanks

in china credit growth has been exceptionally fast photo bloomberg comment global concerns loomed large in the easing bias the reserve bank signalled on wednesday the monetary policy committee s conclusion that an even lower official cash rate may be needed over time echoes the dovish noises coming from major central banks even though each rate cut leaves fewer bullets in its sorely depleted bandolier and drags us closer to the dreaded zero lower bound the reserve bank cannot ignore the risk that a widening gap between new zealand and offshore interest rates would push the kiwi dollar higher as it is even with a historically favourable mix of export and import prices the country ran a trade deficit of 5 5 billion in the year to may and it is tradables prices which collectively fell 0 3 per cent in the year ended march that have kept the consumers price index stuck in the lower half of the reserve bank s target band in addition to the financial channel the committee noted the global slowdown s intensifying impact on the economy through trade and confidence channels the members noted in particular the dampening effect of uncertainty on business investment the mpc is rather less downbeat about the domestic picture it notes evidence of a slowdown but expects that low interest rates and increased government spending this was the first ocr review since the budget will support a lift in economic growth and employment that was also the view of the organisation for economic co operation and development and the international monetary fund both of which have just given the economy the once over the imf s preliminary view is the downside risks to an improving near term outlook have increased mainly due to the international picture the cooling of the housing market could morph into a downturn either because of external shocks or diminished expectations it says risks to global trade and growth from rising protectionism have increased and this could have negative spillovers to the new zealand economy including through the impact on china and australia two key trading partners high household debt remains a risk to economic growth and financial stability and it could amplify the effects of large adverse shocks reserve bank governor adrian orr photo file the global backdrop to this week s ocr decision is the sombre fact that 10 years after the great recession the world economy remains heavily medicated in terms of monetary policy for 10 years now across the developed world central banks policy interest rates have been negative in real terms occasionally rising here and there to zero as new zealand s is now and where that has been insufficient trillions of dollars worth of quantitative easing has been undertaken bond markets are pricing the expectation that this will continue for years yet low for long we are told is the new normal though that is a phrase reminiscent of what have been called the four most expensive words in the language this time it s different the side effects of this dependency on monetary opioids are high levels of debt and inflated asset prices new zealand s debt level household corporate and government combined measured against the size of the economy at 208 per cent of gross domestic product is back where it was on the eve of the global financial crisis for advanced economies as a whole it has risen from 235 to 271 per cent of gdp in china which took 26 per cent of new zealand s exports in the year ended may credit growth has been exceptionally fast rising from 146 per cent of gdp in 2007 to 254 per cent of gdp by the end of 2018 in other words debt has been growing at roughly twice the impressive pace of economic output which in a normal market economy would be considered perilous the imf however seems to regard this more as a chronic than an acute problem the imf has flagged the rapid rise in credit and leverage more broadly as a risk for quite some time thomas helbling who headed the imf team said on wednesday in the current conditions it is seen primarily as a more medium term risk you always worry if there are also short term triggers that could amplify the debt or credit problems but these issues have been around for a while the bigger change in the risk has come from the trade front from the united states meanwhile we have seen not only the weaponisation of trade policy but also badly timed fiscal stimulus now fading and a cavalier view from the white house of the independence of the federal reserve europe is hardly an edifying spectacle either so thank goodness for that haven of tranquillity the middle east but the imf officials take a surprisingly sanguine view of the signals from saggy bond yield curves and stubbornly low interest rates low interest rates are not just an indication of easy monetary policy helbling said there has been a trend decline in interest rates and the fund has commented that a number of forces are at play there including demographics and lower productivity growth the basic idea there is that baby boomers save harder as they approach retirement while weak productivity growth reduces confidence in a rising tide lifting all boats and while the fund has noted that accommodative monetary policy is still needed in many countries at the same time there is also a need to take measures to manage the potential side effects in the sense of increased asset valuations and risks coming from there in the specific new zealand context low interest rates are one of the factors that have contributed to higher house prices and is a reason we have put a lot of emphasis on macro prudential polices helbling said the imf warns that with the reserve bank s easing of lvr restrictions improvements to some risk factors such as credit growth have recently stalled or started to reverse given how high household debt levels are you might want to go easy on any more of that is the fund s message there
central banks in emerging markets have been adding to their gold holdings image credit daniel stein for an asset often dismissed as a barbarous relic gold is doing pretty well says randall forsyth in barron s it has hit a six year high breaching the 1 400 an ounce level not seen since august 2013 this marks a breakout from a trading range it has been stuck in since 2013 when it had fallen back from the record peak above 1 900 it reached in 2011 what s more because the dollar has been strong in recent years gold is looking even better when priced in other currencies trading around 1 127 early this week gold is now within striking distance of its 1 178 per ounce sterling all time high as charlie morris of halkin services notes it has now made all time highs in australian dollars reaching a 2 000 an ounce this week and is only about 3 off that mark in euros this gold rally has breadth a sea of troubles forget cryptocurrencies investors are now turning to a much older and better established expression of distrust in government issued paper currencies as forsyth puts it people are always inclined to top up their gold holdings when the news is bad and there are plenty of

the security of global oil supplies while a resolution to donald trump s trade war with china remains a distant prospect the world economy also appears to be turning down with data in all major regions undershooting expectations recently furthermore central banks response to the slowdown should give the gold rally additional impetus even easier money not too long ago everyone was braced for higher interest rates now it s a different story the world s central banks spent last week embracing easier monetary policy says michelle jamrisko on bloomberg a dovish turn in its language meant that the us federal reserve got as close to a rate cut as possible without actually executing one indeed the debate now is over how big the rate cut will be adds justin lahart in the wall street journal some economists are forecasting a quarter of a percentage point reduction next month others are betting on half yet with the benchmark us short term rate at 2 25 2 5 rates are low to begin with lower us interest rates make dollar denominated investments less attractive which drives down demand for the greenback relative to other assets as gold is priced in dollars a weaker us currency means a higher gold price the new wave of central bank dovishness is broad based in europe mario draghi also hinted at more rate cuts and bond buying brazil held interest rates at a record low while australian central bankers said that further monetary easing down under is more likely than not lower interest rates worldwide are another tailwind for gold unlike equities and bonds the yellow metal pays its holders no income that is usually a significant drawback but with bond yields plunging to new depths they are negative in germany and japan gold looks increasingly attractive on a relative basis the ultimate inflation hedge easier monetary policy also increases the risk of higher inflation which boosts gold as it has maintained its real value for thousands of years markets appear to be underestimating the risks of an inflationary scare lowering interest rates when they are too low already doesn t strike me as a brilliant idea writes charles gave of gavekal research over the last decade the world s central bankers have made an astonishing discovery they think that they can print as much money as they want and even non stop printing will have no inflationary impact yet the laws of economic gravity have not been repealed investors nervous that history will eventually rhyme should replace bonds with gold in their portfolios and be more wary of stocks so where might inflation come from tight labour markets us and uk wage growth have both reached post crisis highs in recent months unemployment in the uk continues to bob around 44 year lows which should give workers more bargaining power to negotiate wage rises last year may have seen the us hit peak graduation says brian pellegrini of intertemporal economics quoted in the halkin letter that implies a squeeze up ahead in the supply of high skilled workers in europe the labour market is also tightening half of poland s companies are reporting recruitment difficulties and remuneration growth in the romanian manufacturing sector is at a ten year high plenty of room in the market another reason to be bullish is the scope for prices to jump once investors notice the upswing and try to cash in on it gold exchange traded fund etf holdings were equivalent to 1 of the us equity market at the metal s 2011 peak notes morris yet that figure is now down to 0 3 meaning the market is comparable to the market

as has been quoted ad nauseum in the market we are right in the middle of thucydides trap and perhaps at the beginning of a new age of bipolarity future disruptions in international political economy and financial markets ought to be and probably are already expected but what about the more immediate future the issue now for financial markets is how this weekend s events will impact global growth more or less now 5 the best case the best case scenario is that the us and china manage to negotiate and finalize a deal this weekend tariffs are removed and new rules are drawn up between the two nations about trade relations currency intervention and intellectual property rights stock markets spiked across the globe pushing the s p500 to new all time highs and the asx200 to new 11 year highs as the earnings outlook improves especially for cyclicals and growth stocks the yen and other safe haven currencies fall along with gold prices as the us dollar lifts with us treasury yields as bets of rate cuts from the us fed unwind commodity prices jump probably supporting an overall outperformance in the aud 6 the worst case the worst case scenario is that trade talks and diplomatic relations break down at the summit and the trade war escalates president trump sticks to his word and applies tariffs to the remaining us300b worth of chinese imports currently not being taxed and the chinese respond in kind on a proportionate value of us imports stock markets tumble especially in china even while global bond yields fall as markets increase their bets of immediate central bank support to ward off recession gold lifts off oil agricultural products and industrial metals drop and the japanese yen goes on a tear across the board especially against growth proxies like the aud nzd and cad 7 the base case both of these scenarios are crude representations of potential extremes they are what in market parlance might be considered tail risks the likeliest and therefore expected outcome at this weekend s g20 is one where nothing is agreed upon but niceties are exchanged as well as pledges to stall the trade war s escalation and return to the negotiating table a relief rally in risk assets like stocks corporate credit growth currencies and maybe even the usd likely resumes while safe havens pare gains as focus returns to watching global growth indicators anticipating earnings season as well as trying to pick exactly when global central banks will cut interest rates next 8 market watch asx futures down 10 points or 0 2 to 6593 near 6 45am aest aud 0 3 to 70 08 us cents on wall st dow flat s p 500 0 4 nasdaq 0 7 in new york bhp 0 6 rio 0 4 atlassian 2 1 in europe stoxx 50 flat ftse 0 2 cac 0 1 dax 0 2 spot gold 0 1 to us1408 11 an ounce at 1 30pm new york time brent crude flat at us66 51 a barrel us oil 0 1 to us59 45 a barrel iron ore 0 3 to us118 02 a tonne dalian iron ore 1 2 to 831 yuan lme aluminium 1 6 to us1790 a tonne lme copper flat at us5988 a tonne 2 year yield us 1 74 australia 0 98 5 year yield us 1 77 australia 1 02 10 year yield us 2 01 australia 1 34 germany 0 32 10 year us australia yield gap near 6 45am aest 67 basis points this column was produced in commercial partnership between the sydney morning herald the age and ig

source si 142 buttresses govt s extraordinary measures the herald june 26 2019 finance and economic development minister professor mthuli ncube shame tarumbiswa correspondent on monday june 24 finance and economic development minister mthuli ncube made a big announcement that government had removed the multi currency regime and restricted domestic transactions to local currency renamed the zimbabwe dollar in an effort to enhance the affordability of goods and services by the majority the multi currency regime started in 2009 to stem runaway inflation and shortages of basic goods and services the latest extraordinary economic measures to buttress statutory instrument 142 of 2019 which by and large outlawed the multi currency trading regime in zimbabwe need to be adopted by the state if the serious economic challenges affecting the citizenry are to be further addressed the practice by the business community of continuing to hike the prices of consumer goods is making basic commodities unaffordable to the majority of people both in cosmopolitan areas and sadly the rural communities that traditionally support and supported the ruling party zanu pf in the past elections ironically owners of businesses who previously pegged their prices in united states dollars usd have not paid their workers by similar margins the manufacturing and retail sectors alike are impervious to the government s progressive repeated calls for them to reduce the prices of consumer goods with utter impunity as a consequence of their evil actions access to medicine and disease treatment was no longer possible for the majority of people because of the high prices which the majority could not afford most pharmacies were charging medicines and supplies in united states dollars some private doctors and health care service providers were also charging in us dollars leaving many patients stranded those who did not have access to the united states dollars were the most affected as they had no choice but dig deeper into their pockets to buy medicines and access healthcare this this is a serious threat to the wellbeing of the citizenry regarding agriculture the mainstay of the economy the majority of farmers cannot afford inputs and veterinary services previously pegged in usd which is a huge threat to the agrarian reforms livestock may die of diseases and the average farmer may resort to subsistence farming due to the current high prices of inputs the bold step taken by the state to outlaw the multi currency basket and the designation of the local currency as a medium of local transactions is commendable this is the way to go as all the countries that are forging ahead with development are using their domestic currencies for all local transactions a few examples of countries trading with own currencies and their exchange rates suffices rwanda 1 usd 885 franc the rwandese central bank office at kigali airport is full of usd changed by visitors an ordinary rwandese do not recognise the usd if given to them zambia 1usd 11 52 kwacha kenya 1usd 100 shilling namibia 1usd 14 5 dollar india 1usd 72 rupee nigeria 1usd 361 naira etc further the state could stabilise the economy by continuing to mobilise foreign currency reserves and to provide measurable assistance to the productive sector for it to be able to export there is also a need for the state to strengthen assistance to farmers so that they grow crops such as wheat and oil seeds to achieve import substitution as well as offering competitive prices for crops that enhance food security furthermore the state may need to educate the citizenry and traders on the value of transacting in local currency as a unit and outlaw the three tier pricing structure some asian traders always have network challenges with the swipe machines a deliberate way of fighting the local currency agenda in addition the citizenry top to bottom need to be cleansed through education of this worrisome insatiable appetite for the us dollar and conversely unbelievable disbelief in our own currency as a medium of trading there is no need to fear past experience with the zimbabwe dollar which was punctuated by a hostile regime change agenda we now have international goodwill which should cushion the local currency against manipulation for political gain provided adequate foreign currency reserves are mobilised while the measures being taken by the state including the interfaces between president mnangagwa and the captains of industry media fraternity chiefs religious leaders professional bodies youths among many other initiatives to address the economic challenges facing zimbabwe are applauded extraordinary measures need to be implemented to deal with this serious threat to national security being caused by the erosion of the citizens purchasing power due to the unrealistic price increases industry and retail sectors must listen to the directives of government to reduce prices of commodities otherwise it can be inferred that their behaviour is tantamount to them being little governments unto themselves the prime minister of india of plus 1 3 billion citizens

as has been quoted ad nauseum in the market we are right in the middle of thucydides trap and perhaps at the beginning of a new age of bipolarity future disruptions in international political economy and financial markets ought to be and probably are already expected but what about the more immediate future the issue now for financial markets is how this weekend s events will impact global growth more or less now 5 the best case the best case scenario is that the us and china manage to negotiate and finalize a deal this weekend tariffs are removed and new rules are drawn up between the two nations about trade relations currency intervention and intellectual property rights stock markets spiked across the globe pushing the s p500 to new all time highs and the asx200 to new 11 year highs as the earnings outlook improves especially for cyclicals and growth stocks the yen and other safe haven currencies fall along with gold prices as the us dollar lifts with us treasury yields as bets of rate cuts from the us fed unwind commodity prices jump probably supporting an overall outperformance in the aud 6 the worst case the worst case scenario is that trade talks and diplomatic relations break down at the summit and the trade war escalates president trump sticks to his word and applies tariffs to the remaining us300b worth of chinese imports currently not being taxed and the chinese respond in kind on a proportionate value of us imports stock markets tumble especially in china even while global bond yields fall as markets increase their bets of immediate central bank support to ward off recession gold lifts off oil agricultural products and industrial metals drop and the japanese yen goes on a tear across the board especially against growth proxies like the aud nzd and cad 7 the base case both of these scenarios are crude representations of potential extremes they are what in market parlance might be considered tail risks the likeliest and therefore expected outcome at this weekend s g20 is one where nothing is agreed upon but niceties are exchanged as well as pledges to stall the trade war s escalation and return to the negotiating table a relief rally in risk assets like stocks corporate credit growth currencies and maybe even the usd likely resumes while safe havens pare gains as focus returns to watching global growth indicators anticipating earnings season as well as trying to pick exactly when global central banks will cut interest rates next 8 market watch asx futures down 10 points or 0 2 to 6593 near 6 45am aest aud 0 3 to 70 08 us cents on wall st dow flat s p 500 0 4 nasdaq 0 7 in new york bhp 0 6 rio 0 4 atlassian 2 1 in europe stoxx 50 flat ftse 0 2 cac 0 1 dax 0 2 spot gold 0 1 to us1408 11 an ounce at 1 30pm new york time brent crude flat at us66 51 a barrel us oil 0 1 to us59 45 a barrel iron ore 0 3 to us118 02 a tonne dalian iron ore 1 2 to 831 yuan lme aluminium 1 6 to us1790 a tonne lme copper flat at us5988 a tonne 2 year yield us 1 74 australia 0 98 5 year yield us 1 77 australia 1 02 10 year yield us 2 01 australia 1 34 germany 0 32 10 year us australia yield gap near 6 45am aest 67 basis points this column was produced in commercial partnership between the sydney morning herald the age and ig
when peasants die there are no comets seen william shakespeare julius caesar act ii scene ii the connections that make society strong also make it vulnerable barry hindes threads this report considers the failure of the french government to prevent the unnecessary deaths of 14 000 predominantly senior citizens during a heatwave in august 2003 governments have frequently used risk management techniques to identify threats and control risks at different levels prevention damage control etc unfortunately in france the government failed spectacularly from the start by not confronting politically tough but conveniently well hidden issues like labour law building design and social capital that contributed to the disaster as the death toll rose their second mistake was to downplay and deny the disaster for the sake of political expediency in a manner that ultimately contributed to even more deaths this essay uses the ideas of sen the marginalised are more risk prone and shiels the marginalised are ignored to show how the problems facing the elderly were exasperated before applying power s theory of how the state selectively filters information to put itself in a politically sanctified position of believing it is incapable of responding to a problem faced by a marginalised group it has no interest in actively saving it also hopes to illustrate a new type of disaster where a vital system people take for granted is overwhelmed by demographic forces introduction a government s lot is not a happy one since feudal times its mandate has been founded on securing the lives of its citizens since it operates the public goods that provide protection e g armies hospitals meteorological services and citizens have a rawlsian belief that the weak including those stricken by disaster will be protected by the state when a government fails to provide this basic need it looses the trust of the people unfortunately for the state it needs to exercise leadership and judgement by limiting the freedoms of its citizens in order to protect them which may be unpopular such as ordering cyclists to wear helmets the state may be tempted to satisfy stronger political groups at the expense of not protecting weaker or diffused groups yet if a crisis does emerge the state can try to salvage its trust with the public by downplaying its existence its implications and whether it really is the government s business to intervene the french heatwave disaster of august 2003 where 14 000 mostly elderly victims died is an excellent case example unlike other disasters with physical damage and articulate victims heatwaves are silent killers that wipe out dispersed population groups often only the government through its statistical and medical services are aware of its magnitude and since the most obvious causes of death can be pinned on the weather or the failure of victims to hydrate themselves it is easy for governments to deny responsibility most damning in france s case was the government s reluctance to acknowledge the crisis and adopt counter measures earlier that would have saved lives this essay will show that a disasters are often rooted in a complicated arrangement of external and invisible factors b interest groups who are responsible for these factors will disavowal responsibility especially when links appears weak c governments are therefore reluctant to pressure these groups especially those who are politically stronger than those exposed to risk and thus d risk control measures become more reactive than preventative yet when disaster strikes governments may deliberately not engage whatever reactive response instruments they have left at their disposal in order to hide the embarrasing fact that something bad occurred on their watch setting the scene this report can rely on certain incontrovertible facts about what happened in august 2003 in france specifically 1 in the first two weeks of august 2003 western europe experienced a prolonged weather pattern typified by high maximum and minimum temperatures that could be considered a heatwave 2 anecdotal evidence cited in the media and later confirmed by mattei suggested that in this period medical and aged care facilities were understaffed causing hospital wards to close services to be withdrawn and or remaining staff to undertake unmanageable workloads 3 statistical records suggest a significant number of excess deaths occurred in this period particularly amongst the elderly from hyperthermic causes and 4 both the public and various political actors progressively formed the impression that france s medical system had broken down because of a number of reasons and consequently 5 certain public servants and politicians were compelled to accept responsibility and resign from office while those who survived the public backlash were made to reconsider the country s approaches to aged care labour hours and other policies background the effects of the heatwave were aggravated by a number of background factors which prevented the french health authorities adequately responding in sufficient time an ageing population france like other developed countries has a growing proportion of elderly citizens however demographically france more balanced than its neighbours thanks to a large youthful and fecund immigrant population and generous maternity leave provisions in 2000 16 1 of its population was aged 65 or older compared with 12 1 in 1970 pison 2000 france also has the highest life expectancy for aged females in europe on average a 65 year old woman will live a further 19 8 years while men can expect an additional 15 4 years giarchi 1996 193 and third highest for males 15 4 in europe as the population ages not only does the demand for nursing home respite and other facilities rises but the supply of labour and taxpayers to support these facilities drops increased education labour participation and vocational aspirations amongst women traditionally the main providers of aged care has also tightened the supply of aged workers although their workforce participation has perhaps lead to more tax revenue that as a pareto dividend has helped pay for pensions and health costs aged care remains a labour intensive activity the 35 hour week in france much of the population in august 2003 were spending the summer holidays away from their workplace and families thanks to the loi aubry inaugurated by the previous jospin administration on 1st january 2000 the working week for french employees employed in firms and organisations with twenty or more employees was cut down to 35 hours a week calculated from an annual total of 1 600 hours the move to the loi aubry was prompted by self interested labour unions who prioritised providing greater leisure time for its members over increased remuneration the government hoped that the law would spurn job creation since the supply of labour hours that existing employees could provide were reduced then new employees would be required to meet the labour demands of the existing workload in 2002 the mandatory application of the 35 hour work week was imposed on all employers in france along with the reduction in working hours came a more flexible framework for employers and employees to negotiate patterns of workplace attendance that would suit cyclical troughs and spikes in demand and thus raise overall labour productivity in the 2003 summer holidays many vacationers spent longer periods away as a result of having accumulated large banks of leave credits in the years after the loi aubry was introduced unemployment indeed did fall from 12 4 in 1997 to around 8 8 in 2001 commentators cited a boom in leisure industries such as fitness centres where demand was influenced by the amount of free time customers had available to spend however strong economic growth was responsible for most employment generation the jospin government itself admitted that perhaps the new regulations only contributed to a fifth of new jobs being created while less partisan economists gave even less credit by the end of 2003 france s employment rate moved upwards to 9 8 australian department of foreign affairs and trade 2004 the best laid plans of the loi aubry failed as a result of policy practitioners assuming that the number of jobs a labour market provides and thus can be shared is constant this mistake known as the lump of labour fallacy forgets that the labour market is both dynamic and heterogeneous the supply of labour is restricted by many factors unlikely to be adequately addressed by the market in the short term such as requisite training and geographical location and the demand for labour constantly shifts being sensitive not only to economic factors like consumer demand and interest rates but also to government policies as the loi aubry was effectively a wage rise since salaries were not adjusted downwards in response to a corresponding drop in hours worked companies responded by choosing alternatives other than hiring new staff to meet production demand where the nature of the work permitted jobs were either replaced by automation or relocated offshore increasingly possible for white collar employment thanks to telecommunication technology cheaper transportation and transfer costs and harmonised industry standards within the european union yet for other occupations where labour supply is inelastic the shortfall in labour hours was made up by employers by compelling the existing staff to increase their own productivity by working harder bartlett 2003 for many of france s medical nursing and aged care workers they simply were expected to carry out their existing workload with fewer staff available france s health care system france has a mixed public health system there are 1 032 public hospitals with a total of 315 687 beds staffed by hospital practitioners according to civil service guidelines in a somewhat inflexible employment regime salaries are based on a flat rate regardless of specialisation or location and seniority determines promotion practitioners may engage in private practice subject to earning and time limits 91 of funding for public hospitals comes from health insurance funds allocated to each facility according to various economic productivity and medical criteria in addition there are 2 139 private establishments with 170 382 beds including user pay clinics and mostly religious non profit hospitals which are heavily subsidised by state grants there is a heavy amount of state supervision and regulation both regional and national which many claim is cumbersome budgetary cut backs to public hospitals which started in the conservative jospin government in 1995 and continued under jospin in 1998 led to hospital bed numbers being cut and foreign doctors being recruited at around half the pay of french doctors to deal with staff shortages it is little wonder that given the inflexible and parsimonious work environment in public hospitals that 80 of french medical graduates in 1998 chose to work in private practice and also in that year 20 of hospital practitioner positions remained unoccupied dorozynski 2000 333 the situation in nursing homes is similar according to hubert falco 80 of french nursing homes are understaffed outside holiday periods based on a benchmark of no more than two residents per employee older people who generally have lost the thirst reflex need to be monitored and cajolled into drinking to ensure they are ingesting enough fluids a labour intensive activity knox 2003 in august 2003 medical and nursing staff in public hospitals were working under the 35 hour provisions with those on night shift working a standard 32 hour week de kervasdoué 2002 anecdotally many public doctors working in essential services like accidents and emergencies stated they work well beyond 35 hours due to administrative requirements they are not allowed to shut down wards and thus they are forced to carry the workload of absentee staff fouché 2002 their obligation to serve made them politically weak compared with other labour sectors those in the private sector however have more flexibility to determine their own periods of engagement and many elected to spend their holidays in the first two weeks of august patients who would otherwise have used these private clinics were therefore reliant on the already overstretched public hospitals the carers of the last resort air conditioning like other european countries the elderly tend to live in older dwellings built before the introduction of air conditioning 53 live in dwellings built before 1962 21 before 1871 dooge 1992 173 in europe france has the second largest proportion of housing built prior to 1919 21 0 sak and raponi 2002 at the start of 2003 only 6 of french houses had air conditioning agence france presse 2004 in 2000 france had approximately 2 5 m2 of air conditioned indoor space per inhabitant slightly under the european union average by comparison in italy greece and spain there is around 6 0 m2 per person and only about 2 of all centrally air conditioned space in france existed in hospitals compared with a european average of 7 centre d energétique 2003 social capital social capital is the sum of all informal altruistic social interactions occuring between people in a community the cornerstone of social capital is the trust neighbours have with each other the best known proponent of social capital robert putnam recently concluded that ethnically homogeneous neighbourhoods had higher levels of social capital than more diverse communities the economist 2004 53 since people are more likely to be altruistic towards their own kind klinenberg noticed in chicago that while economically disadvantaged areas in chicago had more deaths in the 1996 heatwave some poor ethnically homogeneous neighbourhoods which showed evidence of social capital in the form of extended family and friendship networks amongst its residents which led to busier streets and lower crime suffered fewer fatalities even amongst its own minorities 2002 87 south lawndale 85 latino 22 poverty level had a heat death rate of four fatalities per 100 000 compared with a chicago average 56 white 18 poverty level of seven fatalities per 100 000 neighbouring north lawndale 96 black 44 poverty level had a horrendous toll of forty deaths per 100 000 its homogeneity afforded no succour for social capital against a backdrop of the more potent forces of crime and illicit drugs in france the heatwave death rate was particularly high in ile de france with 230 excess mortality hemon and jougla 2003 32 this conurbation includes not just paris but a number of less prosperous surrounding dormitory suburbs banlieux collectively known as the petite couronne with a number of indicators consistent with a fractured community for reasons that vary from unemployment in a post industrial world non participation from mainstream economic and cultural life welfare dependency and ethnocentrism some of its departments have the highest crime rates in france keijzer 2004 many communities in the petite couronne were built as large public housing estates in the last thirty years the ile de france also has the greatest concentration of foreign residents 12 9 compared with 6 3 for france overall observoire régional de la santé 1998 and these figures ignore visibly foreign french nationals also 35 of all france s muslims euroislam 2002 reside here a youthful community group that some think has rejected the kind of gaullic secularist communitarian values needed for social capital to flourish in a multiethnic pluralist country if the electoral successes of the front national in the banlieu electorates are any indication there seems to be a significant degree of social disconnection on ethnic and generational lines paris s north lawnsdale would be either seine saint dennis 26 2 of the population being foreign citizens according to the l institut national de la statistique et des etudes economiques or val de marne where the highest excess mortality rates from the heatwave were recorded 260 and 270 respectively l institut national de la statistique et des etudes economiques 2004 the social problems in the banlieux can be traced to high youth unemployment caused by labour market inflexibility a politically sensitive issue the french government doesn t want to touch the heatwave strikes the deaths generally involved elderly low profile victims who often lived alone this meant that unlike other disasters there was a considerable time lag between when the death rate began to accelerate and when the public and the government became aware of its true scale and could appropriately react quite often the victims were found days after they had died the deaths tended to occur in isolation from each other and could have been interpreted as being due to natural causes aggravated by climatic conditions and the victims failing to hydrate themselves until it became a topical news item the true magnitude and effects of the heatwave was only felt by that proportion of the population involved in france s medical aged and mortuary services timeline neustadt and may who believed that public management can be best understood by using historiographical methods suggest that narratives are the best way to understand how problems occurred as it best illustrates cause and effect phenomena 1986 120 temperature

holds back rain bearing depressions from the atlantic ocean that cool europe the anticyclone funnels in more hot air from the sahara throughout europe temperatures daily maximum and minimum temperatures rose beyond their average stumme 2003 in france from the 4th august maximum temperatures of 35 0 c or greater are experienced at around two thirds of france s 180 weather stations with 15 having temperatures exceeding 40 0 c importantly there are consecutive days of high minimum temperatures which do not give adequate respite especially to those living without air conditioning and instead depend on trapping cool air currents overnight for cooling economic losses included forest fires disrupted riverine transport and crop losses in germany estimates of 80 of crops being lost to heat were circulated by farming associations with losses to the grain harvest alone costing around one billion euros deutsche welle 2003 the heat not just influenced consumer behaviour beer and air conditioner sales enjoyed a boom but also the actual and potential short term labour participation as workers elected to spend their summer vacation away from their stifling cities or extend their absence from work 1 5 august from the 1st to 5th august mean daily maximum temperatures progressively rise from 25 c normal for summer to 37 0 c then right through to the 14th minimum temperatures will not go below 20 c the mortality rate does not move upwards much beyond the august average a text analysis of articles published in the french newspaper le monde during the period show that excessive heat was first only reported as a meteorological phenomenon a threat to agricultural production or as a factor aggravating other hazards such as pollution the forest fires and the inability for nuclear reactors to function at full capacity due to cooling issues 6 7 august maximum temperatures hit 39 c then slightly dipped to 38 c the mortality rate jumps to double then nearly trebles i e 300 the august mean the first media report in le monde of a human fatality due to the heatwave came on the 7th august involving a single 32 year old man le monde 2003a even as mortality peaked in the following days the few le monde articles containing the word canicule heatwave mention nothing about heat deaths neither did the ministry of health make any comment 8 10 august the maximum temperature starts rising upwards to 39 c again while the mortality rate plateaus at around 300 the ministry of health becomes aware of the growing number of hospital admissions around friday 8th august when it identified a marked rise in admissions in the previous 48 hours 2003a the ministry tasks the national institute of medicine to specifically monitor for heat induced deaths in conjunction with regional medical authorities a public health warning is also issued on the 8th with the advice seemingly targetted more towards active people or people responsible for infants no reference was made about any fatalities that had occurred 2003b the 9th and 10th august fell on a weekend and the health ministry did not release any communiqués the first signs of public disquiet came from the president of france s association of emergency physicians patrick pelloux who with first hand knowledge of rising hospital admissions criticised the government s inaction bosch 2003 624 pelloux denies the deaths are natural as the government stated in a communiqué and anticipating worse to come he mentions france faces a veritable massacre breakingnews ie 2003 monday 11 august the maximum temperature stays at 39 c but the mortality rate skyrockets to 450 the national institute of medicine detects an escalation of admissions in public hospitals in france mostly in the ile de france some medical personnel and resources are mobilised to reopen wards closed due to staff absences and elective surgery is postponed in a press release the health ministry acknowledges there has been a rise in heat related deaths since 6th august in particular amongst vulnerable people the press release furthermore mentioned that measures are in place to monitor the situation and assist hospitals and another public advisory is published 2003b health minister dr jean françois mattei gave a news briefing from his holiday villa that evening where he casually downplayed the threat erickson 2003 tuesday 12th august paris suffers its highest maximum temperature with 40 c and the mortality rate peaks at 620 a hotline telephone service is established offering preventative advice and receives 12 000 inquiries on the first day mattei orders the mobilisation of the red cross and some military hospitals while the ministry of health in another press release acknowledged a shortage of space in mortuaries in paris region two articles in le monde make reference to claims by a group of doctors that fifty deaths due to excessive heat had occured and the crisis is worsening in the public hospitals raffarin from his alpine retreat dismissed complaints from his political opposition about the rising death toll as inappropriate and said that for weeks the health service had been preparing for this busy period gentleman 2003 wednesday 13th august the maximum temperature drops suddenly to become only 30 c but the death rate is a dramatic 550 a number of articles aree written about deaths in hospitals with a more alarmist tenor and included reports of the first government reaction that it was monitoring the situation and would convene a meeting within two days mattei still on holiday was verbally abused as he inspected a nearby hospital where 20 patients had died and the greens party calls for his resignation les vertes 2003 he comments for the first time that hospitals around the country were overfilling with casualties finally in the evening raffarin activates plan blanc white plan an emergency set of protocols meant for major disasters plan blancempowers hospital authorities to recall medical staff from leave back to duty and coordinate with government authorities the use of additional facilities and personnel ranging from opening military hospitals to the public to using refrigerated trucks as temporary morgues united press international 2003 many of these measures had already been in place albeit piecemeal and poorly coordinated between different levels of government suggesting that declaring plan blancwas more symbolic than practical thursday 14th august both mattei and raffarin return to paris plan blancgoes into effect six days after the health ministry knew the hospitals weren t coping but on this day the maximum temperature would only reach 27 c the death rate too is dropping down to 200 at a press conference mattei suggests a preliminary figure of 3 000 excess deaths nau 2003 describing the magnitude of the heatwave to be of epidemic proportions friday 15th august and beyond by now the weather and death rate are normalising the only thing useful left for the government to do is to deal with a backlog of bodies needing storage and disposal ironically the 15th falls on a bank holiday so burials need special dispensations from mayors the outcry from the public and the political opposition builds up as the estimated death toll rises with each new revision initial estimates produced by the health ministry of 1 500 to 3 000 are eclipsed by a professional organisation of undertakers estimate of around 10 000 president chirac returns to paris on the 21st after a three week holiday in canada where he had not released any media statements concerning the heatwave he convenes a cabinet meeting to assess what had been the government s response during the disaster and he publically pledges that deficiencies in the health system will be fixed in what was cynically regarded as an attempt to deflect blame away from the government in the form of a eulogy president chirac frames the disaster in terms of a social issue and not a failure of leadership our society must become more responsive and attentive to others to their problems their suffering and their vulnerability he warned these dramas again shed light on the solitude of many aged or handicapped citizens gentleman 2003 later he and other senior members would hold a state funeral for the bodies of 57 unclaimed parisians uncomfortably closing this unfortunate episode the aftermath eventually on 25th september a finalised official figure was given by assessing excess mortality the number of fatalities that occurred over and above a baseline level of mortality that would have been expected at the same time of the year inserm arrived at a figure of 14 802 excess deaths 60 more deaths than usual for the period from 1st to 20th august with these observations the mortality rate rise corresponded to the intensity of the heatwave excess mortality was particularly acute for people aged over 75 70 more deaths than usual but was also significant for people aged 45 to 74 30 the highest concentration of excess mortality in absolute and relative terms was felt in the centre of france in particular in the ile de france region that surrounds paris 134 where 32 9 of excess deaths occurred paris had in total a 127 excess mortality rate although in the surrounding dormitory towns the rates were higher perhaps reflecting the influence of social capital excess mortality rates were lower in smaller rural communities and higher in the larger cities the causes of death responsible for excess mortality were recorded to be heat related heatstroke dehydration hyperthermia etc deaths associated with cardiovascular or cardiopulmonary causes were also considerably higher than normal
because of facebook s libra the state monopoly over the control and issuance of money is now under serious threat the un recognises 180 currencies worldwide as legal tender all of them issued by nation states it does not recognise cryptocurrencies like bitcoin in this way even if communities of enthusiasts have been treating them as a means of exchange for over a decade now yet the latest addition to this group facebookâ s libra threatens to do something that no other cryptocurrencies have come close to achieving the state monopoly over the control and issuance of money is now under serious threat advertisement facebook boasts over half the world population as active monthly users 2 2 billion on facebook 0 8 billion on instagram and 0 7 billion on whatsapp combined with the fact that 1 7 billion adults worldwide have no bank accounts a project like this is the perfect petri dish in which to create a truly global currency the libra council the independent libra council that facebook proposes to oversee this new currency from geneva will become nothing short of a quasi central bank consisting of 27 giant corporates plus facebook it will vet aspiring applicants who wish to join their ranks for a fee of us 10m â 7 9m as well as manage the reserve of state currencies and short term government bonds that will back the libra this model is very different to the likes of bitcoin whose exchange rate is driven purely by the supply and demand in contrast the libra council would be competing in global currency wars against other nation states imagine ten years from now if say 40 percent of all us dollars are held on deposit by facebook the council to back the issued libra coins which have by now become widely used across the world we can hypothesise that us dollars might constitute a 30 percent weight of libraâ s asset backing basket â to have a steady exchange rate for libra the idea is to underpin it with a selection of stable and widely traded financial assets advertisement in the likely event that the us experiences a moderate or even severe economic crisis facebook the council would need to rebalance the basket of assets to defend the value of libra letâ s say they decided to revise down the us dollar weighting in their reserve to 25 percent of the basket this would involve selling huge sums of us dollars and replacing them with say euros and would significantly drive down the value of the dollar advertisement this would be a very negative market signal encouraging other holders of dollars to dump them as well thereby exacerbating the fall and even before this happened facebook could potentially use the mere threat as leverage in negotiating with nation states on matters of regulation taxation and so on based on facebookâ s current revenues it would already be 90th in the world by gdp if it was a nation state so its power to face off in negotiations with states and trading blocs is formidable even without libra advertisement also read â libra four reasons to be extremely cautious about facebook s new currency how do nation states control a global company with unprecedented access to their citizensâ data its own currency and perhaps the ability to affect their domestic politics and the strength of their currency on the global markets it sounds tricky to put it mildly advertisement and by the way itâ s not only facebook that is entering this space jp morgan has just launched a cryptocurrency for institutional customers while 13 other global investment banks are planning to follow suit with currencies in 2020 samsung is rumoured to be looking at launching a currency for ordinary customers while it would not be surprising if other online giants like amazon and google were tempted too advertisement the greater threat mark carney governor of the bank of england and chairman of the financial stability board told the g20 in 2018 that cryptocurrencies didnâ t pose a systemic risk to the global financial system his assessment might have been based on their current footprint rather than their potential in fact the blockchain technology that underpins new currencies like libra has astonishing potential the ability to significantly move exchange rates is only part of it if people buy and sell with these currencies save with them trade with them demand for state currencies and bonds could plunge this would undermine the ability of central banks and governments to buy and sell these assets to set national interest rates it would emasculate this vital means of managing our economies leaving only fiscal levers like taxing and spending at the disposal of states what then advertisement of course such a seismic shift in our control of the use of money would first require these new currencies to be widely adopted yet the genie has been out of the bottle since the arrival of cryptocurrencies â it will be very difficult to stop it now if this space comes to be dominated by big listed companies like facebook and jp morgan it is at least arguably preferable to alternatives like bitcoin which are almost unfettered in having no geographic or tax domicile and being pseudo anonymous in nature a currency like libra also has the potential to reduce consumer transaction speeds improve transparency and allow users to store their wealth digitally using a â trustedâ consortium of founding institutions advertisement and when it comes to future geopolitical shocks like brexit consumers will be able to shield themselves more easily by reducing their exposure to say the british pound by holding their wealth in libra or whatever instead arguably we are talking about a superior type of money that is better aligned to a younger generation that is comfortable with such new forms of money advertisement notwithstanding we need to come to terms with the size of this potential change and its ramifications facebookâ s impact on our societies has been profound over the previous two decades and libra may well eclipse that accomplishment facebookâ s founding mantra of â move fast and break thingsâ seems entirely consistent with the strategy for this currency advertisement the american futurist stewart brand famously said that â once a technology rolls over you if youâ re not part of the steamroller youâ re part of the roadâ well nation states appear not to have been invited to get

if they can t iron out any concessions this weekend markets will be in for a rude awakening oanda edward moya said in a morning note in an interview on fox news earlier white house adviser larry kudlow said no specific agreements had been made ahead of talks between us president donald trump and his chinese counterpart xi jinping this weekend and washington was still insisting on structural changes on intellectual property and enforcement mechanisms that countered a far more optimistic story in the china morning post and a report in the wall street journal saying xi would hand trump a

the may tariffs are feeding into worse data driving global easing this year and next it will take faster usd depreciation or no trade war to likely reverse course td also said both sides are still far apart on key principles like the interaction of the government with the nonstate corporate sector which are held sacrosanct by the chinese side this in our opinion makes it extremely difficult for china to give in on issues seen as critical for the stability and development of their economy or the us to reach a deal even optically given the inability to have their demands met as a result of its rethink on the us china trade dispute td said it now sees the federal reserve cutting rates by 75 basis points this year and another 75 basis points in the first half of 2020 advertisement potentially

central banks we see the rba easing in july and november 2019 and may 2020 taking the cash rate to 0 50 while we see a further 50bps of easing from the rbnz in august and november this year for a cash

raising global banks with higher capital the recapitalisation news shook the banking world on monday but it was a seed sown at the world bank meeting in the united states u s in april unveiling his plan for the next five years central bank of nigeria cbn governor godwin emefiele said recapitalisation is the way to go for nigerian banks to be among the top 500 in the world what will be the new capital base some experts say it may be between n63billion and n100billion collins nweze reports in april a voice seeking higher capital for banks sounded loud and clear from a distant land it was at the spring meetings of the world bank international monetary fund imf in washington united states u s if they wish to compete globally the banks imf said must recapitalise and strengthen their capital base at the african session of the yearly event imf monetary and capital markets department director tobias adrian advised the banks to seek higher capital through recapitalisation and also tackle rising non performing loans npls his advice was heeded on monday when central bank of nigeria cbn governor godwin emefiele unfolded his policy direction for the next five years with recapitalisation of banks topping the list under the impending exercise banks will raise their capital base above the n25 billion minimum level adopted in 2004 the cbn boss also plans to lead the economy to double digit growth single digit inflation 12 billion non oil exports by 2023 and raise financial inclusion to 95 percent by 2024 while retaining the managed float exchange rate the cbn guidelines stipulate that regional banks must have a minimum paid up capital of n10 billion national banks n25 billion and banks with international operations n50 billion according to emefiele the 2004 recapitalisation which increased banks capital base from n2 billion to n25 billion has weakened he plans to pursue a programme that will make the banks rank among the top 500 in the world he said in the next five years we intend to pursue a programme of recapitalising the banking industry so as to position nigerian banks among the top 500 in the world banks will therefore be required to maintain higher level of capital as well as liquid assets in order to reduce the impact of an economic crisis on the financial system you will all agree with me that it was governor charles soludo in 2004 that did the last recapitalisation we had moving the capitalisation from n2 billion to n25 billion and i must commend those efforts because it resulted in positioning nigerian banks not only in africa but also being among the banks in the world in terms of capitalisation and it also increased or helped to strengthen the banking industry capacity to take on large ticket transactions and those are some of the things we badly need today the cbn boss added and if you relate n25 billion in 2004 exchange rate which was about n100 to n25 billion it is certainly only about 200 million today if we relate n25 billion at n360 you can see that it is substantially even lower than 75 million what we are trying to say is that recapitalisation has weakened quite substantially and there is a need for us to say it is time to recapitalise nigerian banks again it is a policy thrust which will be discussed at the committee of governors meeting and of course the framework for the recapitalisation of nigerian banks will be unfolded for the whole world to know stakeholders stand chartered institute of bankers of nigeria cibn president uche olowu said the cbn has industry data and the right information on why the banks should recapitalise recapitalisation he said would provide more funds for the banks to do business especially consumer credit mortgage finance which they have not been given any consideration according to him recapitalisation will give banks the power to take advantage of opportunities in the industry and lend more to the real sector many banks he said had eroded their capital due to the high level of npls adding that recapitalisation will present a new lifeline for the banks for me recapitalisation of the banks is fine i have no problem with that rather i see opportunities that it presents to the economy and the lenders it will be a healthy development for the banks to recapitalise normally from time to time there is always a need for recapitalisation of the banking sector for banks with regional operations recapitalisation will enable them to raise the needed capital for more coverage olowu said association of bureau de change operators of nigeria abcon president aminu gwadabe said recapitalisation would help the banks remove toxic assets from their balance sheets which make it difficult for them to lend the exercise he added will help the lenders attract new foreign and local investors that will provide the needed capital for them to take bigger roles including investment in infrastructure he said the banks were not lending as expected adding that recapitalisation will provide them with the right capital mix to lend to larger segments of the economy former executive director keystone bank richard obire said recapitalisation would draw yes and no answers depending on where one stands he described the npls as high and real noting that a number of banks including the tier 1 lenders are affected by the rise in bad loans according to him if the big banks are groaning under the burden of npls what happens to the smaller banks he said banks capitals have been eroded in 2004 when the recapitalisation took place what the exchange rate was at that time is different from what it is at present he said there is capital erosion in the banks due to naira depreciation the no side is that it will bring challenge for the banks raising capital now may not be easy if the macro environment is upbeat so will be investors gross domestic product gdp growth is still sluggish and raising money in such economy will be difficult he said obire agreed that more capital is required for the banks to be strong and do what they are expected to do he noted that recapitalisation can lead to a drop in quality of service adding that as the banks get bigger customers complaints resolution will take longer time obire said banks can only have more money to grow their businesses in a growing economy according to him every business has the ambition to grow year on year but that would be difficult to achieve under a shrinking economy to him all forward looking banks should look at what would protect their revenues by identifying and focusing on the healthy side of the economy in a report titled cbn s five year monetary policy blueprint managing director financial derivatives company limited bismarck rewane said recapitalisation will bring npls down to nine per cent the industry has about 16 per cent npls average over 200 per cent higher than the five per cent regulatory benchmark head currency market at ecobank nigeria olakunle ezun projected that judging from the percentage increase in capital base of commercial banks in 2004 recapitalisation from n10 billion to n25 billion this time around the figure may hit n70 billion he said the cbn in 2004 raised banks capital base by 150 per cent from n10 billion to n25 billion ezun said the new capital base for banks may be around n63 to n70 billion if the same ratio is applied an economist okechukwu unegbu said emefiele s plan could send panic into the system if not properly managed unegbu said beyond recapitalisation the issue of human capital in the banking industry should also be given attention we must understand that everything is not about money coming into the system we should be talking about capacity building and the type of personnel behind these institutions these days a lot of bankers don t have career path most bankers don t have job satisfaction today the level of fraud in the system is on the rise and it is a result of deficiency in capacity building so it is not only money that we should be talking about if these institutions don t have the required capacity and you throw money into them they would probably be out of business before you know it he added other market sources said the cbn may also adopt n100 billion new capital base for commercial banks to ensure that only lenders with huge financial muscle play in the big league they said the first step is for the regulator to evaluate whether the recapitalisation that was done in 2004 has any impact on the industry and the economy according to them consolidation can either be regulatory induced or market induced what is the objective of the new recapitalisation is it that the buffers are not enough is it that the banks are distressed what is the need for doing it obviously there is always the need for buffers but you cannot make the minimum capital requirement a buffer requirement the analysts said drop in loan demands a researcher guy czatoryski of coronation merchant bank described lending as a principal responsibility banks owes their customers he said the challenge with loan advancement is that only few people come forward to borrow given the slow growth in gdp loan demand he said has dropped significantly in recent years noting that this is a challenge for banks he described weak loan demand as the biggest challenge facing banks explaining that it will continue this year due to poor economic growth he explained that regular bank customers that were borrowing excessively before hardly come back for loans given the poor state of the economy czatoryski said weak borrowing among bank customers has nothing to do with cost of the loans if you tell me that loans are expensive today they have been expensive in the last 10 years but that did not stop people from taking loans it is not a question of pricing for the loans but weak demands for products the industry is weak it is very important not to confuse that he said he said the weak demand for loans is affecting the banks profitability and ability to grow czatoryski said how big is the banking sector and how big is the economy you are talking as if lending is about 100 per cent to gdp lending is only about 10 per cent to the gdp so the link between the banking sector and the economy is not strong because most people do not have loans the outstanding loan of banks is not more than 10 to 15 per cent of the gdp and that is very poor you are talking of a very small banking sector servicing a large economy that is the problem and it will take years for the banking sector to match growth in the economy in the united kingdom uk and america the economic managers can easily control interest rate because almost everybody has a loan that is what is lacking in nigeria because nigerians are not taking loans he advised that the banks should be allowed to make more profits to enable them grow and service a larger part of the economy state of banks banks have been recording sizable growth and profitability in the last five years but the growth is skewed in favour of the big banks also called tier 1 banks while the smaller banks or tier 2 banks continue to struggle the fall of skye bank plc and access bank s acquisition of diamond bank plc which took many customers by surprise were indicators of the tough times in the sector assessing the banks the cbn led bankers committee noted that though the lenders declared nearly n800 billion in profits last year they must continue on aggressive debt recovery realise collaterals of npls and get insurance companies to settle claims relating to insured debts according to the committee such steps are needed to get many of the lenders back on track the banks are also expected to strengthen risk management practices and enforce the cbn restrictions on payment of dividends by banks with high npls filings by many of the banks released by afrinvest west africa an investment and research firm showed that the sector s total assets remain strong rising from n25 1 trillion in 2013 to n29 1 trillion in 2014 the assets also grew to n29 7 trillion in 2015 n33 9 trillion in 2016 and n37 8 trillion in 2017 the assets were around n38 1 trillion in the first quarter of this year majority of the lending done in the sector was carried out by tier 1 banks otherwise called the big banks and these include gtbank zenith bank united bank for africa access bank fbn holdings and ecobank nigeria further analysis of the industry s capital adequacy ratio car for the tier 1 banks showed that access bank car stood at 20 1 per cent in 2017 and 20 8 per cent in the first half of 2018 ecobank nigeria 26 9 per cent 28 5 per cent fbn holdings 17 per cent 18 1 per cent gtbank 25 7 per cent 22 per cent united bank for africa 25 5 per cent 23 per cent and zenith bank 27 per cent 21 per cent during the same period the car is the ratio of a bank s capital to its risk the car for banks with offshore subsidiaries is 15 per cent minimum requirement which rose to 16 per cent since march 1 2015 for systemically important banks the car for banks operating only in nigeria is 10 per cent the ownership factor obire said recapitalisation will alter the ownership structure of many banks noting that it will enable local and international investors to have a stake in the banks in its yearly report in which it released the ownership structure of banks operating in the country the nigeria deposit insurance corporation ndic said foreign investors and government were divesting from the leaders private sector operators it said have gained control of the sector the report showed that 15 of the 26 banks had partial or full foreign ownership in 2017 with five banks having substantial foreign ownership above 50 per cent the banks in this category are citibank 81 9 per cent ecobank 100 per cent rand merchant bank 100 per cent standard chartered bank 99 99 per cent sterling bank 36 94 per cent and union bank plc 86 80 per cent for citibank 18 1 per cent of its ownership rests on nigerians union bank has 13 20 per cent nigerian ownership however access bank has 91 14 per cent nigerian ownership 0 07 per cent government ownership and 8 79 per cent foreign ownership coronation merchant bank has 100 per cent nigerian ownership so also fidelity bank first city monument bank first bank of nigeria plc fbn merchant bank suntrust bank and guaranty trust bank plc other lenders with 100 per cent nigerian ownership include heritage banking company limited keystone bank limited wema bank plc and providus bank limited in comparison to the previous year there was a slight change in the ownership structure of banks the private sector continued to dominate the ownership of nigerian banks while government continued to divest from banks in line with requirements of code of corporate governance for banks and discount houses as government shareholding was below 10 per cent in all the banks except jaiz bank plc ndic said for adrian where there are financial stability concerns authorities are expected to use prudential tools such as higher capital in the banking system and more conservative underwriting standards to reduce financial stability risks he said we advise countries that where those downside risks are increasing to take more steps to ensure that vulnerabilities are not rising too much addressing npls is a first order importance for financial stability many countries have tackled that by developing secondary market for npls and by being aggressive in writing off npls and through provisioning and use of improved accounting standards through international financial reporting standards 9 ifrs 9 will recapitalisation make nigerian banks rank among the top 500 in the world time will tell

andrés manuel lópez obrador s efforts to reverse many of his predecessor s wide ranging reforms is bad news for the people of mexico because he s going to tank their economy since taking office last year mexican president andrés manuel lópez obrador popularly known by his initials amlo has reverted to the retrograde economic nationalism of his early political career his efforts to reverse many of his predecessor s wide ranging reforms is bad news for the people of mexico if amlo remains on this policy course the mexican economy is likely to be further constrained by problems identified in the 2019 edition of the annual index of economic freedom low productivity weak rule of law corruption and the costly inefficiency that always accompanies a large informal sector which remains stubbornly large in mexico president lópez obrador began his climb to the pinnacle of mexican politics in the left leaning institutional revolutionary party pri which enjoyed seven decades of unchallenged one party rule until the corruption fed by massive public spending and statist policies led to its 2000 defeat by the center right pro business national action party pan during the long pri dominance mexico was nicknamed the western hemisphere s ussr and the pri s authoritarian and repressive leaders were called dinosaurs labeled so out of touch with an ever more interconnected world that they should be declared extinct pan s rise in stature was fueled in part by university of chicago trained pri technocrats they saw the 1980s as a lost decade for mexico the result of the decisions of generations of pri leaders who were highly effective tammany hall style political bosses but who couldn t navigate the nuances of policy implementation yet by the 1990s after several rounds of brutal inflation deflation cycles even the pri s leaders recognized that things had to change they authorized the technocrats to begin to make the changes that led to the negotiation of the north american free trade agreement nafta and to the modernization of the mexican economy the pri that regained the presidency in 2012 under the telegenic youngest dinosaur former president enrique peña nieto was a changed party peña nieto embraced a wide ranging reform agenda that included the heretofore untouchable energy sector where he introduced reforms that opened mexico s entire energy supply chain to competition and foreign investment by companies bringing much needed technology unfortunately the peña nieto administration was also deeply corrupt public outrage at that corruption weakened the pri and led to its devastating defeat in the 2018 landslide victory of amlo whose populist morena party also won a substantial majority in congress on promises of ending corruption dedicated though he might be to fighting corruption amlo is just as unschooled in economic policy as were his political mentors in the 1970s since taking office he has already implemented numerous regressive measures that will weaken economic freedom in mexico he rolled back a major reform of mexico s inefficient education system enacted by his predecessor that would have modernized the schools and loosened the grip of the massive and corrupt teachers union via a high handed nontransparent capricious and authoritarian decisionmaking process amlo cancelled a 40 percent completed state of the art international airport in mexico city at a cost to mexican taxpayers of 13 billion a move that roiled financial markets and the peso overruling his well regarded finance minister amlo has also doubled down on state owned poorly managed and financially fragile state owned oil company petróleos mexicanos pemex which already is burdened with debt in excess of 100 billion by building another oil refinery in amlo s home state of tabasco at a cost of 2 5 billion overall amlo seems determined to reverse all of peña nieto s signature energy liberalization policies that will have huge negative consequences especially since u s capacity and investment in natural gas will be increasingly important for mexico as additional electricity generation and infrastructure will be vital to sustain economic growth unfortunately for the people of mexico global financial markets have already rendered their verdict on amlo s reckless policies fitch and moody recently downgraded mexico s credit rating it is inevitable that mexico s index of economic freedom scores on government spending and fiscal health will also deteriorate mexico s 2 trillion economy reflects the benefits of increased economic scores over the past two decades and greater international economic integration for that progress to continue the lópez obrador government should continue and expand upon the reforms of its predecessor in the energy financial fiscal and telecommunications sectors with the long term aim of improving competitiveness and economic growth across the economy james m roberts is a research fellow for economic

callahan mike g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thanks leslie good morning and thank you for joining us today i will begin today s call with a review of our operating highlights and some market commentary and then turn it over to john for a few remarks on his early days here at gms lynn will then cover our financial results in more detail we will then open the line for your questions turning to slide 3 we are very pleased to deliver a strong finish to fiscal 2019 with record net sales and adjusted ebitda for our fourth fiscal quarter organic sales growth of 7 during the fourth quarter reflected higher volumes and pricing across all of our product groups including over 3 points of volume growth in wallboard as a result of strong activity in the united states our strong growth of organic revenue for the quarter was broad based across each of our product lines with 3 8 growth in wallboard sales 13 7 growth in ceilings and 8 3 growth in steel framing other product net sales were also up 7 8 organically and they continue to be a key part of our growth story on the profitability front we also generated record results with a nearly 50 year over year increase in adjusted ebitda to 73 5 million for the fourth fiscal quarter the increase reflected contributions from the titan acquisition growth in our base business our continued focus on operational improvements and favorable lease accounting i d now like to spend a few moments sharing our current view of our end markets in both canada and the united states in our fourth quarter our business in canada continued to be impacted by some softness in the canadian single family residential market coupled with challenging weather conditions earlier in the quarter the canadian business experienced a high single digit year over year sales decline on a constant currency basis with further impact from about a 4 depreciation in the canadian dollar year over year and based on the current forecast we believe it will take some time for this sector of the canadian market to normalize nonetheless the fundamentals contributing to long term canadian housing demand remain sound including strong household formation and population and economic growth also on a positive note the commercial activity in canada remains solid and titan continues to be accretive to our consolidated operating results our long term strategic rationale for the acquisition of the largest distributor in canada remains very compelling including increased scale and footprint in north america geographic expansion into the highly attractive canadian market and creation of a well balanced platform for growth we firmly believe that our investment thesis for this attractive acquisition of strategic importance remains strong on the organisational front in canada we are very pleased to announce that travis hendren most recently vice president of corporate development at gms will be joining the management team in canada as executive vice president reporting to doug skrepnek president of wsb titan travis was an integral part and leader in our acquisition of wsb titan in june of 18 and his appointment to this new role reflects the strategic importance of our canadian operation and as part of our ongoing succession planning as part of the succession plans for titan travis will work closely with doug over the balance of 19 as doug transitions to a consulting role remaining engaged in the business and after doug moves into the consulting role travis will assume the position of president of wsb titan in the united states we continue to be quite encouraged by activity levels and other leading market indicators the organic daily sales volume improvements we have seen in each month in the fourth quarter and continuing into the first quarter of 20 further validates that view as it pertains to residential construction while single family starts so far in calendar 19 have remained perhaps softer than anticipated we have seen mortgage rates and home price appreciation moderate and indicators of seasonal demand are generally positive employment and income growth remain at very healthy levels in many of the major markets in the us continue to have limited housing supply as building remains below historical averages all of which bodes well for the long term outlook and on the commercial front which represents the majority of our business most indicators and estimates point to continued growth against the backdrop of a healthy economy we were seeing this in our own business with strong backlogs and quote activity in recent visits to many of our locations in multiple geographies i have continued to hear from our own people and key commercial customers that pipelines are very robust through calendar 2019 and quotes are going in the calendar 20 and beyond gms generated strong free cash flow in the quarter of 83 million which enabled us to continue to execute on our balanced approach to capital allocation including reducing our net leverage in the quarter to 3 6 times pro forma adjusted ebitda while at the same time expanding our business through acquisitions and greenfield investments and repurchasing 5 million of our common stock during the quarter we closed on the acquisition of commercial builders group in southern louisiana and opened four greenfield locations in carrollton texas fredericksburg virginia harrisburg pennsylvania and portland maine subsequent to the end of the fiscal fourth quarter and as announced earlier this month we acquired hart acoustical and drywall supply in south texas as evidenced by all of these actions we are executing on our capital allocation strategies of debt reduction disciplined growth through acquisitions in greenfields and opportunistic share repurchases now turning to slide number 4 i d like to provide a recap of the highlights for the whole fiscal year 2019 which was a very important year for gms both operationally and strategically we made significant progress on several fronts first we surpassed 3 billion in net sales through both organic growth and acquisitions we completed the acquisition of wsb titan in canada which extended our leadership position in north america with materially expanded scale and footprint we significantly improved overall profitability expanding adjusted ebitda margins by 160 basis points year over year to 9 5 we generated the 175 million in free cash flow and as i just noted we deployed a balanced capital allocation strategy including reducing our net leverage by 0 6 times since closing of the titan transaction a year ago investing the two additional acquisitions and a greenfield expansions and repurchasing 16 5 million of our common stock as we previously announced i will be retiring in august after a 26 year career at gms since this is my last earnings call i wanted to take a few moments to reflect on the growth of gms that i have seen not only throughout my career here but also since the company s ipo in 2016 since my joining gms in 1993 we have grown from about 50 branches to over 250 locations and expanded from 17 states to 43 states in canada our annual sales at the time i joined were 236 million and in just the last three fiscal years since the ipo we have increased our sales by almost 70 more than doubled our adjusted ebitda completed 17 acquisitions with 59 branches and opened 13 greenfield yards it has definitely been a very fast paced and rewarding time here now having the opportunity to work alongside the talented and dedicated gms team has been my greatest privilege and the highlight of my entire business career i m extremely proud that together we have built the number one north american speciality distributor of interior building products and developed a unique corporate culture over the years that continues to be very very special i ve also appreciated working with many of you on the call today and i thank all of our shareholders for their continued support going forward i know that gms has the right team in place to build upon the company s strong track record john who joined us as president in may and will assume the ceo role upon my retirement brings to gms nearly 30 years of distribution and manufacturing industry experience and a broad range of expertise in operations sales customer service distribution and logistics as well as strategic planning and m a having got to know john through our extensive travel and meetings over the last few months i m absolutely confident that with his leadership gms is well positioned to achieve its next phase of growth and success in the years ahead i look forward to continuing to work closely with john until my retirement and also look forward to seeing what he and the team accomplished to raise gms to even greater heights in the future i ll now turn it over to john john c turner president thanks mike for that kind introduction and for your service to gms over the past 26 years it s great to be here today to speak with our analysts and investors i ve enjoyed speaking with some of you since joining gms and look forward to engaging with more of you in the near future let me start by saying how excited i am to be part of the gms family i was first attracted to gms by its leading market position specifically the strength of its north american network combined with local expertise and commitment to service excellence in the short time i ve been here i ve already been impressed by the talent and enthusiasm of the team i ve been welcomed by great people who are clearly dedicated to the company its customers and each other together we are working hard to execute on our plans and build on our existing momentum looking ahead the opportunities for growth are significant i look forward to leading the company and capitalizing on those opportunities as well as further strengthening our customer relationships supplier partnerships product offerings and overall value proposition as we position gms for its next phase of growth and success since joining i ve been spending time in our facilities as well as with our customers and suppliers i m here to build on an already strong foundation and i ll be working with the team to identify ways we can enhance every aspect of our business and we will be sure to keep you updated on our progress i look forward to transitioning into the role of ceo later this summer and working with you all in the future with that i ll now turn it over to lynn to provide more details on our financial results for q4 a lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller thanks john and i would also like to thank you all for joining us today we were pleased to deliver a solid fourth quarter highlighted by record net sales and adjusted ebitda performance and strong free cash flow generation turning to slide 5 we grew net sales 22 7 to 780 1 million we are especially pleased with a 7 increase in our organic sales compared to the fourth quarter of last fiscal year our sales of wallboard were up by 15 to 322 3 million in the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year this increase was driven by acquisitions higher organic volumes and pricing the increase included a 3 8 growth on an organic basis which included an increase in volume of just over 3 and about a 1 increase in pricing our fourth quarter ceiling sales increased by 17 4 year over year to 112 2 million higher organic volumes resulting from increased commercial business along with benefit from acquisitions and pricing improvement drove this increase the 13 7 organic increase was comprised of price increases of approximately 9 as well as higher volumes of approximately 5 our sales of steel frame increased during the quarter by 16 3 year over year to 124 5 million driven by the positive impact of acquisitions higher organic volumes from greater commercial business and pricing the 8 3 organic increase included gains of approximately 4 for pricing and volume sales of our other products which consists of installation joint compound tools stucco eifs and various other complementary products continues to grow rapidly totalling 221 1 million and up 44 4 compared to the fourth quarter of last year the addition of titan has broadened our product offerings and at the same time our nearly 8 increase in base business sales of other product further reinforces the continuing success of our efforts to grow this highly profitable product category gross profit in the fourth quarter increased almost 25 to 257 million this was the result of both higher organic sales and the positive impact of acquisitions as well as pricing improvement gross margin of 32 9 improved 50 basis points from 32 4 a year ago due to contributions from the titan acquisition including purchasing synergies and favorable price cost dynamics index and on a sequential basis gross margin also improved 50 basis points from the third quarter and exceeded the 32 2 guide we indicated in our last call while we benefited from some favorable price cost dynamics and mix in the fourth quarter we do maintain our gross margin guide of 32 2 moving into fiscal 20 turning to slide 6 we improved our leverage of fixed cost reducing our adjusted sg a as a percentage of net sales by 100 basis points year over year to 23 6 this year over year reduction was less than we had previously estimated on our q3 earnings call let s walk through the details while we did recognise the full benefit of our strategic cost reduction and lease accounting changes these benefits were partially offset by some headwinds including unanticipated insurance cost increases in certain corporate expenses related to timing differences as well as lower sales and operating leverage from titan finally we have continued to be impacted by significant inflationary wage pressures as we discussed on previous calls this is a reminder we ve now lapped the year over year benefits from our change in lease accounting and we ll do so with respect to our strategic cost reductions after the first quarter of 20 moving along to adjusted ebitda we delivered 73 5 million of adjusted ebitda in q4 up 46 9 year over year our adjusted ebitda margin was 9 4 as a percent of sales or 8 7 excluding the impact of leases which was up 80 basis points from 7 9 a year ago turning to slide 7 during the fourth fiscal quarter we generated 83 million of free cash flow a significant increase from 15 million a year ago the increase is due to a 40 million reduction in net working capital 24 million of higher net income after adjustments for non cash item and 5 million of lower capital expenditures we use this free cash flow to reduce our net debt by 66 million as well as repurchase 5 million of our common stock and complete the acquisition in greenfield transactions that mike talked about at the end of the quarter our net debt to ltm pro forma adjusted ebitda was 3 6 times which was down from 4 2 times at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 19 and down from 3 8 times at the end of the third quarter we intend to continue to de lever through strong free cash flow generation our balance sheet remains quite healthy with 47 3 million cash on hand and 314 million under our abl facility resulting in substantial liquidity additionally of our total long term debt approximately 80 is not due until 2025 before turning the call back over to mike i d like to touch on a few more outlook items for fiscal 20 for fiscal 20 we expect capex to be in range of 20 million to 25 million and interest expense to be in the range of 70 million to 75 million now let me turn the call back over to mike before we open the line for questions mike g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thank you lynn just a few additional comments before we open the line for questions again we are extremely pleased with our strong finish to the year and our confidence in the team s ability to continue to take advantage of our multiple levers to drive success organic growth greenfields m a and operating leverage we continue to leverage our market leading position in the distribution of interior building products our balanced product portfolio and our diversified exposure across commercial and residential new and r r construction markets and most importantly our great network of dedicated gms colleagues in both the us and canada continue to embrace our strong entrepreneurial culture to drive outstanding performance and service for our customers and our suppliers operator we are now ready to open the line for questions questions and answers operator thank you we will now be conducting a question and answer session operator instructions our first question comes from the line of matthew bouley with barclays please proceed with your question matthew bouley barclays analyst good morning thanks for taking my questions and congrats to mike and welcome to john i wanted to i guess first ask about the free cash flow obviously impressive in the quarter i think you ended up with about 175 million for the full year of 19 is there anything that you call out that anything that particularly drove the strength in the quarter there and how should we think about what free cash flow could look like in fiscal 20 a lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yeah sure matt in terms of what drove the free cash flow in the quarter some of that was driven by about a 35 million increase in accounts payable that we do not expect to experience going forward that kind of brings our expectations down to somewhere between 40 to 45 of adjusted ebitda going forward and that the 35 million of the increase in accounts payable was simply driven by changes in the timing of purchases matthew bouley barclays analyst okay that s perfect thanks for that and then secondly the gross margin i think you said price cost was favorable which drove the strength in the quarter and if i heard you correctly i think you said 32 2 was the expectation for fiscal 20 still so just i guess what are you expecting with price cost and mix that is driving the margin to subside a bit thank you a lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yeah so we believe that the 32 2 is a prudent guide going forward given the uncertainty around the pricing environment obviously you should construe that 32 2 is a floor we hope to do better matthew bouley barclays analyst all right i ll leave it there thanks very much g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thanks matt operator thank you our next question comes from the line of trey grooms with stephens please proceed with your question trey grooms stephens analyst good morning and i want to echo the last comment congrats mike on your retirement it s been great working with you and john we look forward to working with you going forward john c turner president thank you trey g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director yes thank you trey i ve enjoyed it trey grooms stephens analyst well so i want to touch on a couple of things one so your wallboard pricing slid just a little bit sequentially the manufacturers february wallboard increase failed and it seems to have continued to slide a little bit at the manufacturing level at least according to the ppi can you guys talk about what you re seeing there more real time and have you seen any stabilization in the pricing or how should we be thinking about that especially us specifically g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director well i mean i think you touched on it i mean i think the price increase in february definitely was lethargic coming out of the gate and we really did not we just didn t really get much realization to say the least i think right now just the supply demand conditions are such that until that kind of alters a bit i think the price outlook going forward is going to be kind of remains to be seen at this point so but i would say that in general i think the pricing environment is stable right now if i had to kind of give a characteristic to it today but clearly the the increase did not hold trey grooms stephens analyst yeah okay but seeing some stabilization currently i guess is the key takeaway g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director yes yeah that ll be my take trey grooms stephens analyst okay and then my follow up is around canada so just i just want to make sure that i understood your comment so volume down high single digits and was that just on the single family side or is that overall including some of the positive impact from commercial just some clarity around that comment g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director that would be on a consolidated basis that would be in total i and really on the single family front that for the most part is confined to single family low rise i mean if you look at the high rise activity the high rise condo and apartment as well as commercial the fundamentals of those segments are still very sound the real area is focused on that single family low rise and frankly a lot of that is just has to do with a lot of the regulatory pressures have been brought to bear in that segment of the market up there so long term we continue to be optimistic about where it s going to develop but right now there s definitely some noise in that segment of the market trey grooms stephens analyst and just if i can just to get a little bit more kind of back on the pricing within the canadian market i know it s been tight there just wallboard has been tight there over the last few years now with that kind of i guess loosening up a little bit what s the thought around pricing in that market kind of going forward does that usually i know it s a totally different market than us so forgive me if this is elementary question but historically what is that generally done in times of when things start softening up a little bit understanding it s still a quite a bit of imports coming into that market g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director up there i would say and again my historical reference is somewhat limited to having just bought the company a year ago but i would tell you that based on the limited numbers of suppliers up there i mean it s not as if it s like in the stage where you ve got seven manufacturers you can pull from there s really only two or three depending on which part of the country you re talking about to pull from so i don t see any big alterations necessarily in terms of the pricing environment and frankly i think the production would be adjusted based on the demand levels anyway kind of like what you here so i don t see any big price adjustments necessarily taking place up there trey grooms stephens analyst okay thanks for taking my questions i ll turn it over good luck g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thank you trey thanks operator thank you our next question comes from the line of keith hughes with suntrust please proceed with your question keith hughes suntrust analyst thank you my congratulations to you mike and good luck i m sure the golfing industry will see its rounds go up once you head into retirement g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thanks keith keith hughes suntrust analyst just building on a couple of questions that have come in specifically turning to the ceilings industry you ve had some very strong numbers here that is similar to what we saw or better volume what we saw out of armstrong i guess my question is as the speciality business ramps up in ceilings they usg and others have been doing that can you tell us how that benefits gms is there any of that business you missed because it s all direct or how does that work out for you g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director the speciality side keith hughes suntrust analyst yeah speciality side of the business yes g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director you know that we talked about this a little bit before i mean if you look at the gross there s always this conversation around the commodity product and what s the long term growth prospects of that but the reality is is that we ve seen very significant growth in the specialty wood metal ceilings the accoutrements to open platform ceilings for example with the acoustical clouds and things such as that and so i think and i really have to tip my hat to our guys in the field who ve dedicated a lot of resources and energy behind those segments of the business because it requires technical expertise it requires a lot of product knowledge and in many respects we become kind of consultants for even architects as they re trying to design a lot of these more sophisticated spaces so we ve committed a lot of resources to that segment and i think we re yielding the results of that the as products are a key part of the growth story and the other part of it is to just the fundamental r r side and the fact that you ve got that annuity factor built in because of the replacement of either tiles that are damaged due to a water pipe failure or somebody that s building out three new floors there s just kind of a there s an ongoing activity level particularly given the relative strength to commercial right now so it s kind of a combination to factors but the specialty side the architectural specialty side is definitely a growth area for us keith hughes suntrust analyst okay and switching to titan do you think the next couple of quarters where you see your titan business bottom out or were there still be some downside in business as you try to search for a bottom in canada a lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yeah sure keith on the bottom in canada a couple of things first of all our exposure there is 22 of the demand is single family is new single family we certainly hope to see things turn in the next two or three quarters one thing that s starting to turn already canada i think you guys know has a higher lumber business than the us businesses do and we ve already started to see some of the lumber prices start to turn around so don t know where the bottom is we hope that it s now and fully expect to see things start to turn around however it will take a little bit of time for the factors that we discussed related to single family to earn themselves out keith hughes suntrust analyst okay final question on sg a now that you been on titan on for a year do you think there ll be more as you go into year two of ownership will there be more sg a savings less leverage and we would see that tick down for the whole company synergies are we kind of past that g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director well i mean i think on the synergy front that s an ongoing effort it s kind of like we had our first bite at the apple so to speak but as we continue to grow our businesses together we find more opportunities to purchase cross border from the same manufacturers or even new manufacturers we re going to find more opportunities to find synergies and i think frankly is the revenue and expense mix improves as single family comes back and i think you re going to see more opportunities for sg a leverage in the future but that s a tbd there but i i m fundamentally optimistic and i would reiterate as i said earlier the acquisition of titan was and is a very very sound and strategically significant investment for us so while there is some short term hiccups in the business long term it s accretive now and it will continue to grow would be accretive in the future keith hughes suntrust analyst okay thank you very much and good luck again g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thanks keith appreciate it operator thank you our next question comes from the line of michael wood with nomura instinet please proceed with your question michael wood nomura instinet analyst thanks mike it s been a pleasure working with you and congratulations on a well deserved retirement g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director yeah thanks mike appreciate it michael wood nomura instinet analyst first i wanted to get some just more sg a details if you wouldn t mind the wage inflation maybe where exactly that s coming from that s an industry phenomenon or gms specific and maybe some of the timing of the corporate expenses in terms of details on what s driving that when that might come down a lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yeah sure on the first question that you asked with respect to the wage inflation this it s a real thing across the industry it s driven by labor shortages that are pretty significant in construction it s not just the gms thing most of the economies in which we operate are a full employment economy so we re seeing that primarily in logistics but also in other costs related to your question on the timing really nothing ominous just simply year over year timing of certain expenses as well as some unanticipated and unexpected insurance claims that took place the last quarter of the year the last actually in april michael wood nomura instinet analyst thanks and on the favorable price cost that you called out can you just give us some details on that perhaps quantify your cost inflation where that was running just in terms of the gross margin impact a lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller no we re not we can t really quantify the impact of the favorability of price cost we did have some some nice tailwinds from the purchasing synergies as a result of the titan acquisition so really i think the remainder of the increase was due to price cost and the mix michael wood nomura instinet analyst okay but just to understand the sustainability of the low double digit ebitda conversion margins that you achieve which is in line with your long term expectation is that something that you think is sustainable going forward trying to just understand the price cost was sort of like a one time benefit that benefit might win a lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yeah so moving forward we fully expect to be in the 10 to 15 range for incremental adjusted ebitda and we think that s very achievable so we do believe that is sustainable michael wood nomura instinet analyst okay thank you a lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yeah just to qualify that with of course that depends on the pricing environment and on titan s performance as well operator thank you our next question comes from the line of mike dahl with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst good morning thanks for taking my questions and mike and john congrats to you both g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thanks michael john c turner president thank you mike mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst so i wanted to pick up on the titan conversation with the first question i think the business was run rating something around 460 million and 15 ebitda margins on an ltm basis when you bought it clearly some moving pieces since then can you just help us size up what the current run rate on sales and profitability is for the business a lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yeah sure sales is 15 of the total and in terms of level of detail as we ve discussed on previous calls we re not prepared to provide that level of detail mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst got it ok i was shifting gears wallboard pricing mike you mentioned that you re seeing stability in the market today i guess and just looking for a little clarity on that if you could provide a little more detail on the pricing intra quarter and is there anything we should be thinking about in terms of exit rate on pricing that s different from the 324 million ph for the quarterly average a lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller can you reframe the question mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst yeah sure so i think the comment suggested that there s been sequential stabilisation in pricing i guess that the ppi data has kind of continued to move lower sequentially for the manufacturers so your quarterly price was 324 million ph i m just wondering if the exit price if we should be thinking that the price was kind of falling through the quarter so that even if we re stabilising today we could see another down tick in the quarterly price next quarter i just want to make sure we re on the right page there a lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yeah it s a possibility again there s a lot of uncertainty with respect to what we talked about with respect to the pricing environment g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director and it also depends on the mix because that s based on that s exactly number two so i would say that there is no big moves that we re seeing at the parent right now and i think based on the supply demand predictability right now that we re the pricing is generally stable but trying to handicap that going forward is pretty difficult to do at this juncture mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst okay got it if i could get one last question and just on sg a i think you highlighted both the comments in the presentation is the unanticipated costs and timing of certain other costs can you quantify how much of it impact that was in the quarter and kind of how to think about and you re lapping some of the benefits as you mentioned in early fiscal 20 but just how to think about what to expect for sg a moving forward a lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yeah in terms of the mix of the so we got 100 basis points of leverage we would have reforecast to get 200 basis points of leverage year over year the 100 basis points of like let s call it nav ph was half and half due to titan a not being as big of a portion of the business and b not having the ability to leverage its own fixed costs to the extent that we had forecast and the other half being the insurance costs and the timing of a corporate expenses that we talked about going forward we certainly hope to get some leverage how much under our current run rate it is it s really dependent on wage inflation as well as on titan performance mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst okay makes sense thank you all g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thanks mike operator thank you our next question comes from the line of david manthey with baird please proceed with your question david manthey robert w baird analyst thank you hi and mike congratulations and good luck g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thanks david david manthey robert w baird analyst question on to get at these one timers another way here maybe could you just give us the magnitude of the insurance and the timing of other costs sort of year over year what the magnitude of that impact was and then i assume what you re signaling here is that we should get relief on both of those as we move into the first quarter they were sort of periodic to the fourth quarter is that correct a lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yes that is correct g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director yeah david manthey robert w baird analyst and in terms of magnitude basis points or dollars any can you give us an idea of what they were a lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yeah sure 50 basis points was the insurance costs and the timing of certain corporate expenses and 50 basis points was the titan impact david manthey robert w baird analyst okay all right got it g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director give or take yeah a lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller give or take david manthey robert w baird analyst okay that sounds good and then second on pricing it sounds like you re sort of signaling maybe flattish wallboard pricing in fiscal 2020 but could you talk about the ceiling prices will we see another strong quarter coming up here and i m just trying to get an idea of the timing when you lap the prior price increases and i assume at some point you will revert back to sort of the 3 to 5 norm there and then i know it s a long question but just mainly ceiling pricing and timing and then second is steel prices is it possible you could actually see a drag from steel prices this year g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director well as it relates to wallboard i mean i m not smart enough to project out that the entire year 20 will like to see wallboard increases so i mean i i don t want to go record i think say that again a lot of that has to do with demand supply conditions and just overall activity level so that certainly could have an influence as to longer term wallboard pricing on the ceilings front everything that we re seeing in terms of quote activity and backlog and in the general attitude of our folks out in the field is that we re going to continue to see growth in ceilings going forward just based on the current volumes and as we ve discussed on previous calls i mean there is pretty much kind of a built in price increase relative to ceilings year in and year out i mean you get two increases a year and it s fairly predictable so i mean i think our outlook on the ceilings front and our growth and frankly our investments in people and resources to grow that business you can see the fruits of those efforts already and i would see that continuing into the future david manthey robert w baird analyst and then on steal mike g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director yeah steel i tell you dave steel is it s really slept down we ve seen some slippage downward it s obviously prices have fallen and i think when you look at the current market relative to scrap and the availability of ship scrap offshore is limited i would say that our view is that steel prices and i m talking specifically now about the steel the structural side i think we re probably going to see that continue to probably drop in terms of price as we go forward david manthey robert w baird analyst okay thank you g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thanks operator thank you our next question comes from the line of kevin hocevar with northcoast research please proceed with your question kevin hocevar northcoast research analyst hey good morning everybody and congratulations as well to mike and john g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thanks kevin kevin hocevar northcoast research analyst wondering if you could comment on cash usage expectations here in 2020 it seems like debt paydown is the priority but obviously still doing acquisitions and a little bit of share repurchases as well so you can kind of frame up for us as your expectations there and where do you think you can get that net leverage looks like you took off 0 6 from what 4 2 to 3 6 i think this year how much further down do you think you can draw that in fiscal 20 a lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yeah we ll continue to operate using our balance capital allocation approach debt paydown remains a priority we ve talked about our target of a 3 0 the exact timing of that 3 0 obviously depends on the generation of adjusted ebitda if you look from where we were right after the titan deal 4 2 really we re halfway there now so we ll continue to do that in terms of the in terms of the share repurchases we will continue to be opportunistic about share repurchases and we ll continue to be selective about strategic acquisition we think that s an important part of our growth story g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director yeah i would add to that kevin if you look at this quarter to me i think it s kind of a perfect example of this balance strategy that we re approaching i mean it s not an all or nothing proposition we ve got to have the right balance between delevering which we clearly understand is a priority but at the same time as opportunities present themselves whether it s commercial builders whether it s hard or whether it s greenfields we have to continue to run the business long term strategically and as things present themselves from a stock price standpoint we capitalize on that as well i think just a really good picture of how we can do that and at the same time continue to drive down that debt level so that s going to be the strategy going forward kevin hocevar northcoast research analyst yeah okay great and then mike you mentioned the strength you saw here in the fiscal fourth quarter carrying forward into may and june just kind of curious if you can comment on that specifically are you seeing pretty similar growth rates are you seeing any accelerations or decelerations just wondering if you can elaborate that on that a little bit g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director well i mean i think just as a general statement there is a solid level of momentum certainly going into may june just kind of early to tell because we haven t wrapped up all the numbers obviously and that kind of thing but just in talking with the field and meeting with the customers and looking at frankly a lot of the larger commercial folks who were completely booked out for 19 and going into 20 our view is the overall activity level is solid there and even with some of the softness if you want to call it that in single family we re still stocking at an enormous number of units of housing right now in multi family so pretty much broad based i just say that the activity level and the outlook is just very positive is it it s not like a hockey stick or some massive growth but it s just a real solid environment right now and i think the outlook is very positive a lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yeah i just add sequentially during the quarter and continuing into may we saw sequential increases in our sales per day so we re pretty positive about that little bit too early to tell in june since we re still in the month g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director right right kevin hocevar northcoast research analyst got you okay thank you very much g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thanks kevin operator thank you our next question comes from the line of matt mccall with seaport global securities please proceed with your question reuben garner seaport global securities analyst thanks good morning everybody and it s actually reuben on for matt congrats mike and john to you both g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thanks reuben reuben garner seaport global securities analyst most of my questions have been answered just one follow up if i could you mentioned still targeting kind of 10 to 15 of ebitda contribution margin going into this year is there a clarification does that include kind of any pressures that would result from wsb declining i assume that s a higher margin business probably has higher contribution margins does that include any pressure from there that s maybe offset by some synergies or and or any maybe savings if there were to be continued pressure in the canadian business a lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yeah sure the 10 to 15 incremental ebitda contribution does include our forecast which we expect to titan reuben garner seaport global securities analyst okay great and that s all i got everything else was answered thank you guys g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thanks operator thank you our final question comes from the line of truman patterson with wells fargo please proceed with your question truman patterson wells fargo analyst hi good morning everybody thanks for squeezing me in here mike let me add my congratulations i hope you enjoy retirement so g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director yeah thanks truman i appreciate it truman patterson wells fargo analyst yeah first off on the wallboard volumes you know up in the 3 range seems like that s a pretty good result given what s going on with canada s housing starts decline the us starts are down so a pretty good result i guess how do you guys think about your market share there you guys have been maintaining it or even picking up a little bit of market share here in the us g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director i would say as a general statement we feel like we re kind of holding our we re holding our share position if you look at particularly on a 12 month run rate relative to the ga numbers and kind of where we see our numbers coming in so the the growth rates we re very happy with on the organic side frankly there was also some deferred work that got pushed out you ve heard and seen all the things about weather and this and that the reality is there was deferred work that we ve really picked up on as well going into this quarter so it s kind of a combination of factors but we re confident that our share position we re pretty much holding firm a lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yeah i just i would just echo that and say that kind of i read through the gypsum association data which obviously has a lot of noise in it we actually think we might have seen some positive movement on share so we re pretty positive about that truman patterson wells fargo analyst okay great thanks for that and then looking at your greenfields you guys opened four during the quarter seems like you guys are picking up that activity a little bit over the past year could you just walk us through the economics of opening a new branch and kind of the timeline of revenues and cash flows until break even and performing in line with more established branches a lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yeah so in terms of greenfields we still think that the 6 to 8 guide is a generally good guide we did have 8 this year i think it s reasonable to expect that in 20 we ll have that number in terms of the economics of it it s a fairly nominal capital investment there is a period of ramp let s say 12 to 24 months truman patterson wells fargo analyst okay is there any way we can think about kind of the revenue ramp and how long it takes to get a greenfield branch to kind of the average overall branch level g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director maybe 24 maybe just 24 months little bit over 24 i mean the reality is that most of these greenfields as you know we ve talked about the four terminal they re extensions of existing platforms where we might shift x percent of volume from an existing operation with greenfield site i would say that it s a minimal amount of capital investment you re probably good get doing normalized run rate of a couple of years maybe 2 5 years get it on a full run rate basis as a standard branch so to speak truman patterson wells fargo analyst okay g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director but you also in the near term you re picking up logistical benefits because of obviously opening up a new location not trans shipping or going to long distances and that kind of thing truman patterson wells fargo analyst okay thank you operator thank you there are no further questions at this time i would like to turn the call back over to mr callahan for any closing remarks g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thank you well thank you all for joining us today again i really appreciated working with many of you since our ipo in 2016 and i thank all of

17 to 5 27 and as compared to 4 97 of adjusted earnings per share in 2018 represents an expected increase of 5 to 7 or in constant currency 7 to 9 this increase reflects the updated adjusted operating income outlook projection an expected high single digit increase in income from unconsolidated operations and a reduction of the company s fiscal 2019 projected adjusted effective tax rate to approximately 21 the projected adjusted effective tax rate is an increase from 2018 and results in a significant headwind on adjusted earnings per share growth partially offsetting the company s

financial measures also exclude in 2018 the impact of transition and integration costs associated with our acquisition of rb foods in august 2017 as these items significantly impact comparability between years these financial measures also exclude for 2018 and the comparison of our results for 2019 to 2018 the net estimated impact of the effects of the one time transition tax and re measurement of our u s deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the u s tax act passed in december 2017 as these items may significantly impact comparability between years adjusted operating income adjusted operating income margin adjusted income taxes adjusted income tax rate adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share represent non gaap financial measures which are prepared as a complement to our financial results prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles in our consolidated income statement we include separate line items captioned special charges and transaction and integration expenses in arriving at our consolidated operating income special charges consist of expenses associated with certain actions undertaken by the company to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness and are of such significance in terms of both up front costs and organizational structural impact to require advance approval by our management committee upon presentation of any such proposed action including details with respect to estimated costs expected benefits and expected timing to the management committee and the committee s advance approval expenses associated with the approved action are classified as special charges upon recognition and monitored on an on going basis through completion transaction and integration expenses consist of expenses associated with the acquisition or integration of the rb foods business these costs primarily consist of outside advisory service and consulting costs employee related costs and other costs related to the acquisition we incurred these costs in 2018 income taxes associated with the enactment of the u s tax act in december 2017 consists of a net income tax benefit of 297 9 million recognized during the six months ended may 31 2018 which includes the estimated impact of the tax benefit from revaluation of net u s deferred tax liabilities based on the new lower corporate income tax rate and the tax expense associated with the one time transition tax on previously unremitted earnings of non u s subsidiaries we believe that these non gaap financial measures are important the exclusion of special charges transaction and integration expenses and the net income tax benefit associated with enactment of the u s tax act provide additional information that enables enhanced comparisons to prior periods and accordingly facilitates the development of future projections and earnings growth prospects this information is also used by management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends these non gaap financial measures may be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results in addition these non gaap financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate them in the same manner that we do we intend to continue to provide these non gaap financial measures as part of our future earnings discussions and therefore the inclusion of these non gaap financial measures will provide consistency in our financial reporting a reconciliation of these non gaap financial measures to the

changes in foreign currency exchange rates those changes have been volatile over the past several years the exclusion of the effects of foreign currency exchange or what we refer to as amounts

translation effects of changes in rates of foreign currency exchange and provides additional insight into the underlying performance of our operations located outside of the u s it should be noted that our presentation herein of amounts and percentage changes on a constant currency basis does not exclude the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses that is the impact of transactions denominated in other than the local currency of any of our subsidiaries in their local currency reported results percentage changes in sales and adjusted operating income expressed in

than the u s dollar are translated into u s dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year rather than at the actual average exchange rates in

president donald trump has long been convinced that the united states is locked in an unfair trading relationship with china the u s has lost 500 billion a year for many years he has said several times in a possible reference to the balance of trade that showed the nation bought 420 billion more goods from china in 2018 than it sold trump has long touted china s huge exports to the u s as a sign that beijing has been taking advantage of american businesses for decades his determination to redress what he sees as an imbalance has resulted in an escalating trade war with stringent tariffs affecting not only the two countries economic outlooks but also the entire global economy and when he sits down with xi jinping on the sidelines of the g 20 summit being held june 28 and 29 in osaka japan all eyes will be on whether they can restart trade talks that collapsed amid a war of words in may while both sides have good economic incentives to return to free trade experts say the two superpowers also have good political reasons to hold firm and back up the tough rhetoric with action on the u s side the mood music was good with treasury secretary steven mnuchin saying wednesday that washington and beijing were almost done with their trade deal whatever happens next the u s china spat threatens to overshadow the meeting of some of the world s leading economies and crucial topics such as climate change and urgent reform of the world trade organization in may trump doubled u s tariffs on 200 billion of chinese goods to 25 percent and said he was prepared to slap the same tariff on the remaining 300 billion if there was no progress in talks the effect of this would be huge goldman sachs has warned it would cause global equity markets to fall by 4 percent the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd predicts that renewed tensions between the two countries could see global gross domestic product gdp drop by as much as 0 6 percent the chief economist of the international monetary fund imf gita gopinath said in a blog post in may that the trade war could significantly dent business and financial market sentiment disrupt global supply chains and jeopardize the projected recovery in global growth in 2019 low income households in the u s would be chief among those to suffer from increased prices if the tariff regime was extended she added that s why the mood music coming out of osaka the first official meeting between the two sides in months matters so much why has the dispute become so intense trump spoke so much about u s china trade on the campaign trail in 2015 that a three minute compilation video of him saying china went viral on social media and has since been viewed more than 15 million times a sign for the g 20 summit at a train station in osaka japan tomohiro ohsumi getty images and as promised he has delivered an anti globalization protectionist america first trade agenda billed as a policy that protects u s workers and businesses from unfair chinese practices not everyone believes trump s bold rhetoric will be met by further action there is a real question over whether the u s administration would really be willing to impose all of those i m dubious because this would involve putting tariffs on almost all of the rest of chinese imports said mike jakeman a senior economist at pwc the accountancy and consultancy company in london that would lead to domestic inflation and suddenly you ve got consumers who are quite angry as to why the cost of buying a new iphone has gone up appreciably he said and in an election year when trump has already talked about the economy extensively in his campaign he probably won t want that risk trump s twitter account hails u s economic success on a daily basis from record jobs numbers to stock market highs and it s this economic good fortune that allows him to treat china in terms of foreign policy not just economics jakeman added it s remarkable that trump has gone almost three quarters of the way through his term without really having a difficult decision to make about the economy he has enjoyed a really solid spell that s allowed him to pursue his foreign policy strategy he said national pride as for china the dispute is also about national pride as well as economic success posturing goes both ways and according to james mcgregor an american author journalist and businessman who has lived in china for more than 25 years and is currently chairman of the consulting firm apco worldwide china may have more time to spare despite its domestic economic slowdown the bremen express cargo ship prepares to dock at florida s portmiami which saw china as its top trading country in 2018 joe raedle getty images file i think we have to remember xi jinping does not have to get re elected in 2020 donald trump does and when there s more tariffs coming and they really hit the u s economy and the stock market takes a dive trump will want the stock market to go back up before his election he said so i do think china can be more patient than the u s on this because it s now wrapped up in chinese nationalism very tightly because of huawei he said referring to the huge chinese communications firm that in may was banned from doing business in the u s on whether china is being unfair to u s companies seeking to do business in the country as trump and others allege the picture is more complex the trump administration has made chinese compliance with ip laws a priority for any agreement on reducing or eliminating tariffs between the two countries and it has become a protectionist issue that underscores national pride for both leaders all the more so after trump banned huawei china s leading communications firm from doing business in the u s vicky pryce a former senior u k government economist and now a board member at the centre for economics and business research a london based consultancy said that while american consumers would ultimately be the ones to pay the price for higher tariffs the u s had been justified in taking china to task on various fronts president donald trump greets china s president xi jinping during a business leaders event at the great hall of the people in beijing on nov 8 2017 nicolas asfouri afp getty images file for one thing the government helps chinese companies in a variety of ways such as widespread hidden subsidies she said china has been opening up and so on but it has used all sorts of tricks that make it hard for anyone to see if they have been dumping goods and so on she said you can t say whether in an economic sense it s been wrong but the question is whether you go about it this way the issue of ip theft has long been a bone of contention for trump and for american businesses one third of whom say chinese firms have stolen from them at some point in the past decade at a cost of between 225 billion and 600 billion annually according to the office of the u s trade representative china needs to step up efforts in reform and opening up and carry out more policies in respecting and treating foreign companies and chinese companies as equal to create a better business environment said wei jianguo a former vice minister of commerce and the vice president of china international economic exchange center a government think tank the escalation of tariffs comes as the global economy faces the possibility of a downturn after picking up in 2016 and 2017 with investment and manufacturing stagnating economists generally define a global recession as when growth falls below 2 percent the imf is forecasting 3 6 percent for 2020 which is out of the danger zone but significantly below the 4 percent

the us president donald trump threatened china with more tariffs yet again wiping away the mild optimism that came after the announcement of delayed tariffs on some 300 billion chinese goods a day earlier the s p500 0 12 and the dow 0 04 closed in the negative territory for the third straight day while nasdaq gained 0 32 energy 1 54 and technology 1 09 stocks outperformed but the utility stocks 2 15 dived on growing risks of a further weakness in global demand but stocks in asia roared and the australian dollar advanced the most among the g10 versus the greenback on confirmation that trump and xi will meet on june 29 at 11 30am local time in osaka it is important to note that the chances of a trade deal remain low trump also renewed pressure on federal reserve fed governor jerome powell saying we should have draghi instead of our fed person in quite a disrespectful language what donald trump wants is not the european central bank s ecb draghi of course but its lower interest rates in this respect mario draghi who has recently pledged to pull the euro area interest rates to even more negative territories has apparently gained the admiration of mr trump speaking of that investors continue piling into the european sovereign bond markets and the german 10 year yield fell to 0 33 this week a fresh historical low amid the expectations of additional asset purchases from the ecb and deeper negative rates in the coming months it must be concluded that investors are also loving what they hear from draghi trump is clearly not the only fan on the block now it is worth noting that the us economy has been doing well under the fed person s lead the us first quarter gdp growth is expected to be revised up to 3 2 at today s release versus 3 1 printed a month earlier the unemployment rate remains at a 50 year low yes fifty meanwhile the us stock markets are at all time highs with 10 year treasury yield a touch above the 2 level even under these circumstances the governor of fed shows willingness to pursue an accommodative policy to make sure that the trade war between the us and china doesn t interfere with the economic growth and the market prices in a 25 basis point cut from the fed in july followed by one or perhaps two more cuts in the coming months powell deserves a little mercy the us dollar index recovers from three month lows a strong gdp read could give a further boost to the us dollar bulls while a softer than expected figure should cap the upside potential later in the session the single currency on the other hand remains well supported by the ez sovereign inflows and a broadly brittle us dollar buyers were found near the 200 day moving average 1 1344 on wednesday keeping the euro upbeat although the gfk survey printed a deteriorating german consumer confidence in july and italy s deficit to gdp ratio rose 4 1 in the first quarter faster than 2 1 printed earlier hence mr draghi has his own headaches starting from today a wave of inflation figures across the eurozone countries could revive the ecb s concerns regarding the slowing consumer price growth further data could also suggest a lower economic confidence and a waning business climate in the euro area mainly due to negative vibes felt by the global trade worries and the brexit uncertainties yet the weak economic conditions are mostly priced in the euro s value and the eurozone consolidated data could hint at an improvement in core inflation from 0 8 y o y to 1 0 in june therefore the single currency could focus on building a further positive trend against the greenback as we move forward ftse set for a slightly positive start the european markets are set for a mixed open the ftse 100 is expected to start a touch stronger in london mining and energy stocks will likely remain in demand the pound remains under pressure after the bank of england boe governor hinted that in case of a no deal brexit the bank could consider a stimulus package to support the economy though the response to a potential no deal scenario will not be automatic a softer pound could exert some additional pressure on british consumer prices and could still encourage some policymakers to opt for higher interest rates to tame inflation as a result the line between the boe s hawkish and dovish camps is still unclear wti tests 69 a barrel according to eia s weekly petroleum status report the us net oil exports turned positive in week to june 21st for the third time since 2015 after washington lifted the restriction on oil exports it is certainly too early to call for a us oil independence but the data suggests a clear positive trend in favour of the us wti crude tested the 60 mark for the first time in a month on wednesday opec and its allies will meet on june 1 2 and are expected to announce further production cuts to maintain the recovery in oil prices opening calls ftse to open 5 points higher at 7421 dax to open 37 points higher at 12282

economic zone sez management bodies and civil society from myanmar cambodia and thailand committed to promoting decent work in mekong sezs from 20 21 june representatives of the myanmar cambodian and thai governments thilawa sez and phnom penh sez management committees employer associations un agencies asian development bank and civil society organisations csos gathered in bangkok to hear research findings and recommendations from the mekong migration network mmn and asian institute of technology s ait recent project and forthcoming report that will be published next month and to discuss what sezs can and should do to promote opportunities for decent work for women migrant workers influenced by the project s findings on limited childcare supports for migrant workers in sezs dr than than thwe joint secretary 1 of myanmar s thilawa sez management committee presented a three year plan to conduct a detailed survey on the childcare needs of thilawa sez workers this survey would lead to the implementation of sez based as well as potentially community based childcare centres dr than than thwe explained that factory owners monthly corporate social responsibility contributions could support the development of these centres on site childcare is a win for everyone dr than than thwe exclaimed from employers as it would contribute to reducing labour shortages and increasing productivity to employees as it would provide a safe environment for their children and emotional security spurred by the example of thilawa sez mr sun samouen senior human resource manager of phnom penh sez informed the plenary that phnom penh sez would also begin investigating the possibility of setting up a childcare centre in the zone another encouraging initiative was shared by mr soe naing deputy director of the department of labour under myanmar s ministry of labour immigration and population molip and a representative of the labour section of thilawa sez mr soe naing informed participants that sez based firms have agreed to pay new workers the full minimum wage from the onset of employment rather than training and probationary period wages which are legally less than the statutory minimum wage of 4 800 myanmar kyat or around 3 us dollars per day during the workshop participants from myanmar actively debated the project s recommendation to pay workers a living wage agreeing on the need to study and account for inflation and the rising cost of living for families as opposed to gauging it on an individual s basic needs when devising a new minimum wage rate a garment manufacturers association in cambodia representative shared cambodia s standing practice of reviewing the minimum wage annually through tripartite negotiations in line with ilo standards and encouraged the myanmar counterparts to consider doing the same since myanmar s minimum wage law was adopted in 2013 a new minimum wage rate has been set roughly once every two years mmn and ait researchers shared project findings revealing restrictions on workers access to freedom of association and limited social dialogue platforms across all of the studied sezs study respondents reported cases of collective industrial actions being suppressed trade unions struggling to be established and outside unions failing to access workers inside the zones during the meeting representatives of the thilawa sez management committee and molip expressed a commitment to working with trade unions and labour rights organisations moving forward a commitment which csos intend to closely follow up on despite seeming enthusiasm for improved working conditions and access to labour rights in sezs from some myanmar and cambodian actors participants acknowledged the challenges that exist for myanmar cross border migrant workers in thailand s tak sez employers in tak are increasingly registering migrant workers for border passes under section 64 of the royal ordinance on the management of foreign workers employment b e 2560 2017 which grants workers 30 day visas and 90 day work permits this form of registration excludes migrant workers from accessing social security benefits limits their movement to the three districts classified as tak sez and prevents them from migrating with dependents further reducing childcare options while issues were raised related to the need to recognise workers skills and pay them accordingly csos shared that migrant workers in tak sez continue to receive far less than the 310 thai baht 10 us dollars daily minimum wage with the study finding that workers were receiving around 57 of the minimum wage 174 thai baht or 5 66 us dollars on average from 2016 to 2019 mmn and ait supported by canada s international development research centre idrc investigated labour and migration issues through a gendered lens in four sezs thilawa sez in myanmar phnom penh sez and manhattan sez in cambodia and tak sez in thailand guided by the question of whether the jobs being created within mekong sezs are promoting decent work an international labour organization ilo concept for fair and secure job opportunities for women migrant workers the study focused its attention on the garment industry within these zones sez development has been expanding in the greater mekong sub region gms in recent years myanmar is constructing three sezs while there are roughly 30 in cambodia 10 in thailand and over 30 in other gms countries the garment industry is being established in these spaces as investment privileges and quality infrastructure are aimed at attracting manufacturers seeking low production and labour costs women represent the majority of the garment industry s workforce but are often concentrated in the lowest paying positions with the least recognised skills the challenges they face are compounded when they are also migrants who experience a unique set of vulnerabilities within the gms manufacturing production in sezs increasingly hinges on internal and cross border migrant labour although mmn and ait s study found that the potential of mekong sezs to support decent work has not yet been realised multi stakeholder discussion during the two day workshop and the commitments expressed by the management teams of cambodian and myanmar sezs left some participants feeling hopeful that through sustained collaborative and transparent efforts sezs could have the potential to set an example for decent labour practices
menafn khaleej times dubai and abu dhabi s ranking in the cost of living index went up in 2019 but actual cost of living or inflation declined due to fall in housing rentals and prices of commodities as the us dollar and the uae dirham strengthened against the european and other free floating currencies over the last 12 months according to mercer s 2019 cost of living survey of 500 cities released on wednesday dubai s ranking jumped from 26 to 21 while abu dhabi rose from 40 to 33 vladimir vrzhovski global mobility consultant for mercer mena said the cost of living in dubai went down while ranking moved higher because a lot of european cities saw their currencies depreciating against the dollar hence the cost of living and ranking of those cities went down faster the cost of living in dubai and abu dhabi actually went down for residents their ranking went up because a lot of european cities dropped in ranking due to a weak euro so when the european currency declined it pushed dubai s ranking up he said if we see from global perspective it does look dubai became more expensive but when you re living in the country there has been a big decrease in prices for the last 12 months statistically speaking we are looking at 2 09 per cent deflation between april 2018 and 2019 and that is mostly driven by decline in housing rents imports of goods from china also became cheaper due to the strengthening of the dollar against the yuan overall living is cheaper here vrzhovski told khaleej times in an interview nirav shah director of fame advisory said in order to remain an attractive city for expatriates the cost of living in dubai has to be lower than the big cities such as london and new york for example education in dubai for private schools is at least 30 per cent more expensive than abu dhabi this indirectly increases cost of living for people here which can be reduced to some extent shah said however overall quality of life and infrastructure he said is certainly comparable to any leading cities of the world according to mercer the ranking of other gulf cities also moved up due to the pegging of their currencies to the greenback but actual cost of living went down some of those cities for example riyadh s ranking jumped 10 places to 35 manama rose 20 places to 57 jeddah moved up from 117 to 100 muscat from 117 to 103 and kuwait from 121 to 119 in the mercer s cost of living survey vrzhovski said due to the strong performance of the greenback countries with currencies which are pegged to the dollar have risen in the ranking compared to most of the european cities while cities in the uae have risen up the ranking for cost of living the country continues to be an appealing location for expats due to highly competitive compensation packages falling real estate prices high safety standards and a healthy economy local inflation level has come down for the last 12 months due to falling rental prices and the full phase in of the vat implementation he said many currencies in the middle east are pegged to the us dollar which pushed cities up in the ranking as well as steep increases for expatriate rental accommodations said yvonne traber global mobility product solutions leader at mercer globally eight of the top ten cities in this year s ranking are in asia due in part to a strong housing market hong kong remains the most expensive city for expatriates both in asia and globally as a result of the housing market and currency being pegged to the us dollar driving up the cost of living locally this global financial center is followed by tokyo 2 singapore 3 seoul 4 shanghai 6 and ashgabat turkmenistan 7
the success of the reform agenda is predicated on the adoption of a credible and executable budget for fy2020 and beyond washington d c united states of america june 27 2019 apo group a mission from the international monetary fund imf led by mika saito visited monrovia june 12 24 2019 to discuss possible financial support under the extended credit facility the mission supports the authorities objectives of restoring macroeconomic balance in the near term addressing weaknesses in governance and institutions of the public sector improving the business climate and putting liberia on a fiscally sustainable and inclusive growth path towards these aims good progress was made in a number of important areas including the contours of the fy2020 budget the stance and modalities of monetary policy and a structural reform program that is consistent with the government s pro poor agenda for prosperity and development discussions will continue over the period ahead the mission held discussions with his excellency president george manneh weah speaker of the house of representatives dr bhofal chambers president pro tempore of the senate albert chie finance minister samuel d tweah central bank governor nathaniel r patray minister of commerce wilson k tarpeh members of the house and senate senior government and central bank officials and development partners at the end of the mission ms saito issued the following statement following a series of external shocks including a fall in key commodity prices the lingering effects of ebola and the rapid depreciation of the exchange rate that followed the economic situation facing liberia has proved challenging growth has slowed reserve stocks have come under significant pressure and macroeconomic imbalances have increased inflation accelerated and now stands at about 23 percent the difficult economic conditions and loss of purchasing power are being felt particularly by the most vulnerable members of society many of whom are experiencing significant hardship macroeconomic stabilization particularly a lowering of inflation is the immediate priority the success of the reform agenda is predicated on the adoption of a credible and executable budget for fy2020 and beyond in addition participation across all groups within the public sector is essential to support the reform agenda key to this is that expenditure be held to a level consistent with realistic estimates of the resource envelope so that budget execution in the coming year can proceed with predictability and efficiency this is needed to support the provision of essential public services and avoid the accumulation of domestic arrears securing enough resources to fund an efficient government expenditure program will require both additional revenue measures and reforms to reallocate expenditure the latter requires a reduction in the size of the public sector wage bill as it currently accounts for almost 65 percent of total budget expenditure and is effectively crowding out needed spending in other areas full implementation of a credible and equitable wage restructuring program is essential to the success of the overall reform agenda the mission noted the importance of rebuilding foreign exchange reserves to improve resilience to externals shocks which is one of the key objectives of fund supported programs the mission also highlighted the importance of allowing the exchange rate to remain flexible and improving the transparency of cbl s foreign exchange operations the mission welcomes the new monetary policy framework developed by the central bank of liberia cbl aiming to better manage monetary conditions to achieve price stability in this regard the mission supports the cbl s intention to achieve greater alignment of interest rates on its newly introduced monetary policy instruments the mission notes however that success of the new monetary policy framework will also hinge on a successful fiscal program and the elimination of additional government borrowing from the cbl the reform agenda will also place requirements on managing the cbl s operational budget improving internal controls and oversight and strengthening governance the mission welcomed the recent appointment of non executive governors of the cbl and the two acting deputy governors as essential for improvement in the bank s operational efficiency and governance discussions also included a package of growth enhancing structural reforms to strengthen public financial management reduce corruption and improve the business climate in this regard the mission noted the need to improve private sector confidence in the reform agenda the attainment of better economic outturns in the years ahead and on government s commitment to working closely with business to remove unnecessary administrative barriers and reduce corruption the mission would like to thank the authorities for the excellent cooperation it received and for the candid and constructive discussions that facilitated a productive exchange of views it looks forward to further discussions to follow in the period ahead
president donald trump has long been convinced that the united states is locked in an unfair trading relationship with china the u s has lost 500 billion a year for many years he has said several times in a possible reference to the balance of trade that showed the nation bought 420 billion more goods from china in 2018 than it sold trump has long touted china s huge exports to the u s as a sign that beijing has been taking advantage of american businesses for decades his determination to redress what he sees as an imbalance has resulted in an escalating trade war with stringent tariffs affecting not only the two countries economic outlooks but also the entire global economy and when he sits down with xi jinping on the sidelines of the g 20 summit being held june 28 and 29 in osaka japan all eyes will be on whether they can restart trade talks that collapsed amid a war of words in may while both sides have good economic incentives to return to free trade experts say the two superpowers also have good political reasons to hold firm and back up the tough rhetoric with action on the u s side the mood music was good with treasury secretary steven mnuchin saying wednesday that washington and beijing were almost done with their trade deal whatever happens next the u s china spat threatens to overshadow the meeting of some of the world s leading economies and crucial topics such as climate change and urgent reform of the world trade organization in may trump doubled u s tariffs on 200 billion of chinese goods to 25 percent and said he was prepared to slap the same tariff on the remaining 300 billion if there was no progress in talks the effect of this would be huge goldman sachs has warned it would cause global equity markets to fall by 4 percent the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd predicts that renewed tensions between the two countries could see global gross domestic product gdp drop by as much as 0 6 percent the chief economist of the international monetary fund imf gita gopinath said in a blog post in may that the trade war could significantly dent business and financial market sentiment disrupt global supply chains and jeopardize the projected recovery in global growth in 2019 low income households in the u s would be chief among those to suffer from increased prices if the tariff regime was extended she added that s why the mood music coming out of osaka the first official meeting between the two sides in months matters so much why has the dispute become so intense trump spoke so much about u s china trade on the campaign trail in 2015 that a three minute compilation video of him saying china went viral on social media and has since been viewed more than 15 million times a sign for the g 20 summit at a train station in osaka japan tomohiro ohsumi getty images and as promised he has delivered an anti globalization protectionist america first trade agenda billed as a policy that protects u s workers and businesses from unfair chinese practices not everyone believes trump s bold rhetoric will be met by further action there is a real question over whether the u s administration would really be willing to impose all of those i m dubious because this would involve putting tariffs on almost all of the rest of chinese imports said mike jakeman a senior economist at pwc the accountancy and consultancy company in london that would lead to domestic inflation and suddenly you ve got consumers who are quite angry as to why the cost of buying a new iphone has gone up appreciably he said and in an election year when trump has already talked about the economy extensively in his campaign he probably won t want that risk trump s twitter account hails u s economic success on a daily basis from record jobs numbers to stock market highs and it s this economic good fortune that allows him to treat china in terms of foreign policy not just economics jakeman added it s remarkable that trump has gone almost three quarters of the way through his term without really having a difficult decision to make about the economy he has enjoyed a really solid spell that s allowed him to pursue his foreign policy strategy he said national pride as for china the dispute is also about national pride as well as economic success posturing goes both ways and according to james mcgregor an american author journalist and businessman who has lived in china for more than 25 years and is currently chairman of the consulting firm apco worldwide china may have more time to spare despite its domestic economic slowdown the bremen express cargo ship prepares to dock at florida s portmiami which saw china as its top trading country in 2018 joe raedle getty images file i think we have to remember xi jinping does not have to get re elected in 2020 donald trump does and when there s more tariffs coming and they really hit the u s economy and the stock market takes a dive trump will want the stock market to go back up before his election he said so i do think china can be more patient than the u s on this because it s now wrapped up in chinese nationalism very tightly because of huawei he said referring to the huge chinese communications firm that in may was banned from doing business in the u s on whether china is being unfair to u s companies seeking to do business in the country as trump and others allege the picture is more complex the trump administration has made chinese compliance with ip laws a priority for any agreement on reducing or eliminating tariffs between the two countries and it has become a protectionist issue that underscores national pride for both leaders all the more so after trump banned huawei china s leading communications firm from doing business in the u s vicky pryce a former senior u k government economist and now a board member at the centre for economics and business research a london based consultancy said that while american consumers would ultimately be the ones to pay the price for higher tariffs the u s had been justified in taking china to task on various fronts president donald trump greets china s president xi jinping during a business leaders event at the great hall of the people in beijing on nov 8 2017 nicolas asfouri afp getty images file for one thing the government helps chinese companies in a variety of ways such as widespread hidden subsidies she said china has been opening up and so on but it has used all sorts of tricks that make it hard for anyone to see if they have been dumping goods and so on she said you can t say whether in an economic sense it s been wrong but the question is whether you go about it this way the issue of ip theft has long been a bone of contention for trump and for american businesses one third of whom say chinese firms have stolen from them at some point in the past decade at a cost of between 225 billion and 600 billion annually according to the office of the u s trade representative china needs to step up efforts in reform and opening up and carry out more policies in respecting and treating foreign companies and chinese companies as equal to create a better business environment said wei jianguo a former vice minister of commerce and the vice president of china international economic exchange center a government think tank the escalation of tariffs comes as the global economy faces the possibility of a downturn after picking up in 2016 and 2017 with investment and manufacturing stagnating economists generally define a global recession as when growth falls below 2 percent the imf is forecasting 3 6 percent for 2020 which is out of the danger zone but significantly below the 4 percent seen in 2017 so an economic cease fire between the two sides could be a much needed boost if there is suddenly a resolution of the trade problem then you could see a very substantial improvement pryce said i don t think it s a very happy environment at the moment
eleven years after its creation the group of 20 g 20 has emerged as an important forum of most of the world s systemically important economies iran is among the very few important countries left out india made its mark within the g 20 from its very inception with prime minister manmohan singh being one of the important voices at the first three summit meetings in 2008 09 as the host of the 2022 summit india has a stake in ensuring the continued relevance of g 20 for global policy the g 20 came into being in the midst of a financial crisis it meets over the next two days in osaka japan in the midst of a crisis in world trade in its early years the g 20 shied away from talking trade while it has focused on trade policy issues since 2013 the g 20 has not been able to revive the doha development round of multilateral trade negotiations at the world trade organisation nor has it succeeded in arresting the drift towards mercantilism on the part of both the us and china the world s biggest trading nations host prime minister shinzo abe has done well to focus on trade policy as one of the three key issues to be discussed at the osaka summit along with environment and the digital economy advertisement as of today the g 20 owes its reputation mainly to its ability to restore stability to the global financial system following the trans atlantic financial crisis in 2008 09 as stock market indices from new york through london to tokyo began to fall to new lows the price of gold and oil declined sharply and the euro slumped against the dollar then president of france nicolas sarkozy flew into camp david for a hurriedly set up meeting with us president george w bush and suggested that heads of government of major economies should get together to manage the enveloping crisis that was october 2008 a month after the collapse of lehmann brothers one of america s biggest financial corporations the two leaders came out of their huddle and announced the convening of the first summit level meeting of a group of finance ministers called the g 20 a decade before that in 1999 the g 8 a club of developed economies created a group of finance ministers of 19 major economies and the eu to form the g 20 finance ministers forum bush and sarkozy elevated this finance ministers group into a leaders summit the us and the european union eu knew that the one country they wanted across the table in october 2008 to help deal with the fallout of the financial crisis was china should g 8 be expanded into g 9 japan was certainly not comfortable with the idea the us and the eu too were not ready yet to invite china to the high table of a rich man s club two years after inviting russia into g 7 some of the original g 7 members were already a bit uncomfortable with russia s elevation into a rich economies club when it was nowhere as prosperous an economy as the g 7 advertisement but china had to be brought to the discussion table because china had the dollars and the means to save the euro and stabilise wall street that s the dilemma sarkozy solved for the west by converting an existing g 20 finance minister s forum that included developing countries like brazil and india into a leaders summit it may be easier getting china to help the west in a group that would include other developing countries voila the g 20 was born since the immediate challenge was a financial crisis the group focused on global financial issues once the global financial system stabilised the g 20 summits lost steam and focus everything from climate change to women s empowerment is now discussed at g 20 summits while the really important business gets done in bilaterals on the sidelines this year president trump and china s president xi jinping are expected to discuss bilateral trade issues on the sidelines of the g 20 summit their meeting threatens to overshadow the summit advertisement the summits have invited this fate with their diffused focus in the run up to the osaka summit there have been several ministerial meetings covering subjects ranging from environment and agriculture to women s empowerment and the digital economy along with the summit an entire circus comes to town there is a b 20 for business leaders y 20 for youth an l 20 for labour s 20 for science and so on even a t 20 for think tanks since g 20 summits are annual gatherings of the world s most important leaders they should have an agenda that focuses on the here and now and a means of monitoring progress at the end of each year the host country should present a report to the next summit on progress made on agenda points there are many other plurilateral and multilateral forums to discuss the myriad other challenges facing humanity the b 20 y 20 t 20 and other such parallel gatherings have become either farcical talk shops of pretentious busybodies or networking opportunities for business leaders just as the world bank international monetary fund and wto ministerial meetings have been trivialised and turned populist by parallel gatherings of non governmental organisations ngos the g 20 too runs the risk of becoming a ritual event with no concrete outcomes osaka should bring sharper focus to g 20 proceedings by concentrating minds on today s threats rather than tomorrow s challenges the us china trade war american unilateralism in trade policy and china s opaque trade and other economic policies have emerged as major threats to global economic growth and stability the g 20 must discuss these issues because all g 20 economies have a stake in the outcome of the us china bilateral talks the g 20 cannot be reduced to a g 2 the writer is distinguished fellow institute for defence studies analysis new delhi
the us accused china of reneging on promises china accused the us of economic terrorism can trump xi make a deal osaka japan they represent most of humanity and as leaders of the group of 20 nations gather in japan for their annual summit on friday and saturday rarely have the economic stakes been higher for them and their people the trade war between the united states and china rising tensions between the us and iran that could threaten global oil supplies and strained diplomatic ties between saudi arabia and turkey could all surface during the summit in the southern city of osaka but many analysts say trade will dominate the talks one of the most highly anticipated events of the summit will happen on its sidelines a meeting between us president donald trump and chinese president xi jinping the us china trade war will be the defining issue of the forthcoming g20 summit in osaka simone tagliapietra research fellow at bruegel a brussels based economic think tank told al jazeera the japanese presidency seeks to steer the world s most powerful economies away from confrontation but only the scheduled meeting between president trump and president xi jinping will provide more clarity on what s next for the global trading system he said trade talks between the two sides stalled last month after trump and his negotiators accused china of going back on promises to make structural economic changes the us wants china to stop forcing foreign companies to transfer technology in key areas such as artificial intelligence and telecommunications it also wants it to curb subsidies to state owned firms and grant foreign companies better access to chinese markets meanwhile china accused the us of naked economic terrorism and bullying after the talks broke down trump more than doubled import tariffs on 200bn worth of chinese goods to 25 percent in may he has also threatened to impose tariffs on another 325bn of goods covering nearly all the remaining chinese imports into the us including consumer products such as mobile phones computers and clothing beijing retaliated with increased tariffs on 60bn worth of us goods and state media have raised the possibility that china could start holding back exports of so called rare earth elements crucial for a variety of electronic components absolutely possible there s been plenty of jockeying by both sides in the run up to the trump xi meeting chinese vice commerce minister wang shouwen said on monday that china and the us should be willing to make compromises in the trade talks and not insist only on what each side wants and on wednesday trump said it is absolutely possible that he and xi will emerge from their meeting with a deal but he added i m also very happy where we are now he reiterated his threat to impose additional tariffs if the two leaders fail to make progress also caught up in the dispute is chinese telecommunications giant huawei the us has barred american firms from selling it key components saying it s a threat to us national security the g20 is an international leaders forum consisting of 19 countries and the european union collectively this grouping represents more than 80 percent of the world s economic output and two thirds of its people its primary aim is to promote international financial stability something which appears to be in short supply at the moment several high profile economists have warned of the risks to the global economy if the trade war drags on or escalates in april the international monetary fund s imf managing director christine lagarde said the world s economy was at a delicate moment and added global growth has been slowing largely because of rising trade tensions and financial tightening in the second half of 2018 and earlier this month the imf said current and threatened us china tariffs could cut 2020 global gross domestic product gdp by 0 5 percent or about 455bn a loss larger than g20 member south africa s annual economic output others say the potential impact could be even higher the organisation for economic cooperation and development estimates a 0 6 percent drop in global gdp over two to three years if the trade wars continue it called for urgent cooperative action and described the state of the world s economy as fragile but as the summit kicks off it s hard to see either side heeding that call the g20 meeting in osaka struggles to align widely differing interests meaningful agreements are therefore unlikely martin schulz a senior research fellow at the fujitsu research institute told al jazeera trade war impact but just how delicate or fragile is the world economy the existing trade barriers appear to be having noticeable effects even before any further escalation the us economy added 75 000 new jobs in may that was below analysts forecasts lower than the 100 000 needed to absorb new entrants into the job market and far smaller than the 185 000 new hires in april the lack of meaningful jobs growth in manufacturing and lower than average wage growth in manufacturing gives another indication that trump s trade war is hurting workers and the economy seth harris a distinguished scholar at cornell university s school of industrial and labor relations and former acting secretary of labor under former president barack obama told al jazeera in china and across asia factory activity is slowing down china s official purchasing managers index pmi for may came in at 49 2 below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction similar guages in japan south korea malaysia and taiwan also showed a slowdown in manufacturing a key driver of economic activity and jobs in the region though pmi figures are regarded as anecdotal evidence of the state of a country s economy hard data pointing to a slowdown is now starting to emerge singapore s annual economic growth rate slipped to its lowest in nearly a decade in the first quarter of this year the southeast asian country has one of the most trade dependent economies in the world according to the world bank singapore s exports amounted to more than 173 percent of its gdp in 2017 behind only luxembourg and hong kong high energy meanwhile other risks to the health of emerging economies are also mounting tensions between the us and iran have been on the rise since may 2018 when trump pulled the us out of an international deal with tehran giving it economic incentives to shut down its nuclear programme crude oil prices surged last week after iran shot down a us military drone that followed attacks in recent weeks on oil tankers in the strait of hormuz a crucial choke point for global oil shipments and ratcheting up the stakes even further trump imposed sanctions on iran s supreme leader ali khamanei and other top officials on monday iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif has publicly accused senior us officials such as national security advisor john bolton of harbouring a thirst for war the price of a barrel of brent crude has risen more than 23 percent since the start of the year for a variety of reasons including most recently worries that a shooting war between iran and the us could reduce global oil supplies that price increase is putting pressure on several economies that are highly dependent on oil imports including g20 member india the rise in its fuel bill is happening as it tries to deal with chronic joblessness its unemploymentrate hit a 45 year high last year and the government s large budget deficit is hampering its ability to stimulate the economy and india is facing its own trade dispute with the us in a tweet on thursday trump said indian tariffs on us products including walnuts were unacceptable earlier this month india imposed higher retaliatory tariffs on 28 us goods such as walnuts almonds and apples that was in retaliation for trump s move to scrap trade privileges under the generalized system of preferences gsp for india the biggest beneficiary of a scheme that allowed duty free exports of up to 5 6bn a year trump said he s looking forward to meeting indian prime minister narendra modi at the summit another g20 member country facing problems with higher oil prices is turkey it has grown closer to iran and russia and further away from the west in recent years as its energy demand has risen lacking significant hydrocarbon reserves turkey gets more than 90 percent of its energy needs from abroad spending 43bn on energy imports last year so an expected bilateral meeting between trump and turkish president recep tayyip erdogan will also be keenly watched for progress over disagreements between them especially turkey s decision to base russian made missiles on its soil and turkey s big regional rival saudi arabia is also expected to be in osaka represented by crown prince mohammed bin salman relations between the two countries have been strained since the murder of saudi journalist jamal khashoggi in saudi arabia s consulate in istanbul last year the japanese government is nevertheless expected to do all that it can to make the summit a success pushing a number of issues where progress might indeed be made such as establishing an international framework for the reduction of marine plastic litter

call with a review of our operating highlights and some market commentary and then turn it over to john for a few remarks on his early days here at gms lynn will then cover our financial results in more detail we will then open the line for your questions turning to slide 3 we are very pleased to deliver a strong finish to fiscal 2019 with record net sales and adjusted ebitda for our fourth fiscal quarter organic sales growth of 7 during the fourth quarter reflected higher volumes and pricing across all of our product groups including over 3 points of volume growth in wallboard as a result of strong activity in the united states our strong growth of organic revenue for the quarter was broad based across each of our product lines with 3 8 growth in wallboard sales 13 7 growth in ceilings and 8 3 growth in steel framing other product net sales were also up 7 8 organically and they continue to be a key part of our growth story on the profitability front we also generated record results with a nearly 50 year over year increase in adjusted ebitda to 73 5 million for the fourth fiscal quarter the increase reflected contributions from the titan acquisition growth in our base business our continued focus on operational improvements and favorable lease accounting i d now like to spend a few moments sharing our current view of our end markets in both canada and the united states in our fourth quarter our business in canada continued to be impacted by some softness in the canadian single family residential market coupled with challenging weather conditions earlier in the quarter the canadian business experienced a high single digit year over year sales decline on a constant currency basis with further impact from about a 4 depreciation in the canadian dollar year over year and based on the current forecast we believe it will take some time for this sector of the canadian market to normalize nonetheless the fundamentals contributing to long term canadian housing demand remain sound including strong household formation and population and economic growth also on a positive note the commercial activity in canada remains solid and titan continues to be accretive to our consolidated operating results our long term strategic rationale for the acquisition of the largest distributor in canada remains very compelling including increased scale and footprint in north america geographic expansion into the highly attractive canadian market and creation of a well balanced platform for growth we firmly believe that our investment thesis for this attractive acquisition of strategic importance remains strong on the organisational front in canada we are very pleased to announce that travis hendren most recently vice president of corporate development at gms will be joining the management team in canada as executive vice president reporting to doug skrepnek president of wsb titan travis was an integral part and leader in our acquisition of wsb titan in june of 18 and his appointment to this new role reflects the strategic importance of our canadian operation and as part of our ongoing succession planning as part of the succession plans for titan travis will work closely with doug over the balance of 19 as doug transitions to a consulting role remaining engaged in the business and after doug moves into the consulting role travis will assume the position of president of wsb titan in the united states we continue to be quite encouraged by activity levels and other leading market indicators the organic daily sales volume improvements we have seen in each month in the fourth quarter and continuing into the first quarter of 20 further validates that view as it pertains to residential construction while single family starts so far in calendar 19 have remained perhaps softer than anticipated we have seen mortgage rates and home price appreciation moderate and indicators of seasonal demand are generally positive employment and income growth remain at very healthy levels in many of the major markets in the us continue to have limited housing supply as building remains below historical averages all of which bodes well for the long term outlook and on the commercial front which represents the majority of our business most indicators and estimates point to continued growth against the backdrop of a healthy economy we were seeing this in our own business with strong backlogs and quote activity in recent visits to many of our locations in multiple geographies i have continued to hear from our own people and key commercial customers that pipelines are very robust through calendar 2019 and quotes are going in the calendar 20 and beyond gms generated strong free cash flow in the quarter of 83 million which enabled us to continue to execute on our balanced approach to capital allocation including reducing our net leverage in the quarter to 3 6 times pro forma adjusted ebitda while at the same time expanding our business through acquisitions and greenfield investments and repurchasing 5 million of our common stock during the quarter we closed on the acquisition of commercial builders group in southern louisiana and opened four greenfield locations in carrollton texas fredericksburg virginia harrisburg pennsylvania and portland maine subsequent to the end of the fiscal fourth quarter and as announced earlier this month we acquired hart acoustical and drywall supply in south texas as evidenced by all of these actions we are executing on our capital allocation strategies of debt reduction disciplined growth through acquisitions in greenfields and opportunistic share repurchases now turning to slide number 4 i d like to provide a recap of the highlights for the whole fiscal year 2019 which was a very important year for gms both operationally and strategically we made significant progress on several fronts first we surpassed 3 billion in net sales through both organic growth and acquisitions we completed the acquisition of wsb titan in canada which extended our leadership position in north america with materially expanded scale and footprint we significantly improved overall profitability expanding adjusted ebitda margins by 160 basis points year over year to 9 5 we generated the 175 million in free cash flow and as i just noted we deployed a balanced capital allocation strategy including reducing our net leverage by 0 6 times since closing of the titan transaction a year ago investing the two additional acquisitions and a greenfield expansions and repurchasing 16 5 million of our common stock as we previously announced i will be retiring in august after a 26 year career at gms since this is my last earnings call i wanted to take a few moments to reflect on the growth of gms that i have seen not only throughout my career here but also since the company s ipo in 2016 since my joining gms in 1993 we have grown from about 50 branches to over 250 locations and expanded from 17 states to 43 states in canada our annual sales at the time i joined were 236 million and in just the last three fiscal years since the ipo we have increased our sales by almost 70 more than doubled our adjusted ebitda completed 17 acquisitions with 59 branches and opened 13 greenfield yards it has definitely been a very fast paced and rewarding time here now having the opportunity to work alongside the talented and dedicated gms team has been my greatest privilege and the highlight of my entire business career i m extremely proud that together we have built the number one north american speciality distributor of interior building products and developed a unique corporate culture over the years that continues to be very very special i ve also appreciated working with many of you on the call today and i thank all of our shareholders for their continued support going forward i know that gms has the right team in place to build upon the company s strong track record john who joined us as president in may and will assume the ceo role upon my retirement brings to gms nearly 30 years of distribution and manufacturing industry experience and a broad range of expertise in operations sales customer service distribution and logistics as well as strategic planning and m a having got to know john through our extensive travel and meetings over the last few months i m absolutely confident that with his leadership gms is well positioned to achieve its next phase of growth and success in the years ahead i look forward to continuing to work closely with john until my retirement and also look forward to seeing what he and the team accomplished to raise gms to even greater heights in the future i ll now turn it over to john john c turner president thanks mike for that kind introduction and for your service to gms over the past 26 years it s great to be here today to speak with our analysts and investors i ve enjoyed speaking with some of you since joining gms and look forward to engaging with more of you in the near future let me start by saying how excited i am to be part of the gms family i was first attracted to gms by its leading market position specifically the strength of its north american network combined with local expertise and commitment to service excellence in the short time i ve been here i ve already been impressed by the talent and enthusiasm of the team i ve been welcomed by great people who are clearly dedicated to the company its customers and each other together we are working hard to execute on our plans and build on our existing momentum looking ahead the opportunities for growth are significant i look forward to leading the company and capitalizing on those opportunities as well as further strengthening our customer relationships supplier partnerships product offerings and overall value proposition as we position gms for its next phase of growth and success since joining i ve been spending time in our facilities as well as with our customers and suppliers i m here to build on an already strong foundation and i ll be working with the team to identify ways we can enhance every aspect of our business and we will be sure to keep you updated on our progress i look forward to transitioning into the role of ceo later this summer and working with you all in the future with that i ll now turn it over to lynn to provide more details on our financial results for q4 a lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller thanks john and i would also like to thank you all for joining us today we were pleased to deliver a solid fourth quarter highlighted by record net sales and adjusted ebitda performance and strong free cash flow generation turning to slide 5 we grew net sales 22 7 to 780 1 million we are especially pleased with a 7 increase in our organic sales compared to the fourth quarter of last fiscal year our sales of wallboard were up by 15 to 322 3 million in the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year this increase was driven by acquisitions higher organic volumes and pricing the increase included a 3 8 growth on an organic basis which included an increase in volume of just over 3 and about a 1 increase in pricing our fourth quarter ceiling sales increased by 17 4 year over year to 112 2 million higher organic volumes resulting from increased commercial business along with benefit from acquisitions and pricing improvement drove this increase the 13 7 organic increase was comprised of price increases of approximately 9 as well as higher volumes of approximately 5 our sales of steel frame increased during the quarter by 16 3 year over year to 124 5 million driven by the positive impact of acquisitions higher organic volumes from greater commercial business and pricing the 8 3 organic increase included gains of approximately 4 for pricing and volume sales of our other products which consists of installation joint compound tools stucco eifs and various other complementary products continues to grow rapidly totalling 221 1 million and up 44 4 compared to the fourth quarter of last year the addition of titan has broadened our product offerings and at the same time our nearly 8 increase in base business sales of other product further reinforces the continuing success of our efforts to grow this highly profitable product category gross profit in the fourth quarter increased almost 25 to 257 million this was the result of both higher organic sales and the positive impact of acquisitions as well as pricing improvement gross margin of 32 9 improved 50 basis points from 32 4 a year ago due to contributions from the titan acquisition including purchasing synergies and favorable price cost dynamics index and on a sequential basis gross margin also improved 50 basis points from the third quarter and exceeded the 32 2 guide we indicated in our last call while we benefited from some favorable price cost dynamics and mix in the fourth quarter we do maintain our gross margin guide of 32 2 moving into fiscal 20 turning to slide 6 we improved our leverage of fixed cost reducing our adjusted sg a as a percentage of net sales by 100 basis points year over year to 23 6 this year over year reduction was less than we had previously estimated on our q3 earnings call let s walk through the details while we did recognise the full benefit of our strategic cost reduction and lease accounting changes these benefits were partially offset by some headwinds including unanticipated insurance cost increases in certain corporate expenses related to timing differences as well as lower sales and operating leverage from titan finally we have continued to be impacted by significant inflationary wage pressures as we discussed on previous calls this is a reminder we ve now lapped the year over year benefits from our change in lease accounting and we ll do so with respect to our strategic cost reductions after the first quarter of 20 moving along to adjusted ebitda we delivered 73 5 million of adjusted ebitda in q4 up 46 9 year over year our adjusted ebitda margin was 9 4 as a percent of sales or 8 7 excluding the impact of leases which was up 80 basis points from 7 9 a year ago turning to slide 7 during the fourth fiscal quarter we generated 83 million of free cash flow a significant increase from 15 million a year ago the increase is due to a 40 million reduction in net working capital 24 million of higher net income after adjustments for non cash item and 5 million of lower capital expenditures we use this free cash flow to reduce our net debt by 66 million as well as repurchase 5 million of our common stock and complete the acquisition in greenfield transactions that mike talked about at the end of the quarter our net debt to ltm pro forma adjusted ebitda was 3 6 times which was down from 4 2 times at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 19 and down from 3 8 times at the end of the third quarter we intend to continue to de lever through strong free cash flow generation our balance sheet remains quite healthy with 47 3 million cash on hand and 314 million under our abl facility resulting in substantial liquidity additionally of our total long term debt approximately 80 is not due until 2025 before turning the call back over to mike i d like to touch on a few more outlook items for fiscal 20 for fiscal 20 we expect capex to be in range of 20 million to 25 million and interest expense to be in the range of 70 million to 75 million now let me turn the call back over to mike before we open the line for questions mike g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thank you lynn just a few additional comments before we open the line for questions again we are extremely pleased with our strong finish to the year and our confidence in the team s ability to continue to take advantage of our multiple levers to drive success organic growth greenfields m a and operating leverage we continue to leverage our market leading position in the distribution of interior building products our balanced product portfolio and our diversified exposure across commercial and residential new and r r construction markets and most importantly our great network of dedicated gms colleagues in both the us and canada continue to embrace our strong entrepreneurial culture to drive outstanding performance and service for our customers and our suppliers operator we are now ready to open the line for questions questions and answers operator thank you we will now be conducting a question and answer session operator instructions our first question comes from the line of matthew bouley with barclays please proceed with your question matthew bouley barclays analyst good morning thanks for taking my questions and congrats to mike and welcome to john i wanted to i guess first ask about the free cash flow obviously impressive in the quarter i think you ended up with about 175 million for the full year of 19 is there anything that you call out that anything that particularly drove the strength in the quarter there and how should we think about what free cash flow could look like in fiscal 20 a lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yeah sure matt in terms of what drove the free cash flow in the quarter some of that was driven by about a 35 million increase in accounts payable that we do not expect to experience going forward that kind of brings our expectations down to somewhere between 40 to 45 of adjusted ebitda going forward and that the 35 million of the increase in accounts payable was simply driven by changes in the timing of purchases matthew bouley barclays analyst okay that s perfect thanks for that and then secondly the gross margin i think you said price cost was favorable which drove the strength in the quarter and if i heard you correctly i think you said 32 2 was the expectation for fiscal 20 still so just i guess what are you expecting with price cost and mix that is driving the margin to subside a bit thank you a lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yeah so we believe that the 32 2 is a prudent guide going forward given the uncertainty around the pricing environment obviously you should construe that 32 2 is a floor we hope to do better matthew bouley barclays analyst all right i ll leave it there thanks very much g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thanks matt operator thank you our next question comes from the line of trey grooms with stephens please proceed with your question trey grooms stephens analyst good morning and i want to echo the last comment congrats mike on your retirement it s been great working with you and john we look forward to working with you going forward john c turner president thank you trey g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director yes thank you trey i ve enjoyed it trey grooms stephens analyst well so i want to touch on a couple of things one so your wallboard pricing slid just a little bit sequentially the manufacturers february wallboard increase failed and it seems to have continued to slide a little bit at the manufacturing level at least according to the ppi can you guys talk about what you re seeing there more real time and have you seen any stabilization in the pricing or how should we be thinking about that especially us specifically g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director well i mean i think you touched on it i mean i think the price increase in february definitely was lethargic coming out of the gate and we really did not we just didn t really get much realization to say the least i think right now just the supply demand conditions are such that until that kind of alters a bit i think the price outlook going forward is going to be kind of remains to be seen at this point so but i would say that in general i think the pricing environment is stable right now if i had to kind of give a characteristic to it today but clearly the the increase did not hold trey grooms stephens analyst yeah okay but seeing some stabilization currently i guess is the key takeaway g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director yes yeah that ll be my take trey grooms stephens analyst okay and then my follow up is around canada so just i just want to make sure that i understood your comment so volume down high single digits and was that just on the single family side or is that overall including some of the positive impact from commercial just some clarity around that comment g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director that would be on a consolidated basis that would be in total i and really on the single family front that for the most part is confined to single family low rise i mean if you look at the high rise activity the high rise condo and apartment as well as commercial the fundamentals of those segments are still very sound the real area is focused on that single family low rise and frankly a lot of that is just has to do with a lot of the regulatory pressures have been brought to bear in that segment of the market up there so long term we continue to be optimistic about where it s going to develop but right now there s definitely some noise in that segment of the market trey grooms stephens analyst and just if i can just to get a little bit more kind of back on the pricing within the canadian market i know it s been tight there just wallboard has been tight there over the last few years now with that kind of i guess loosening up a little bit what s the thought around pricing in that market kind of going forward does that usually i know it s a totally different market than us so forgive me if this is elementary question but historically what is that generally done in times of when things start softening up a little bit understanding it s still a quite a bit of imports coming into that market g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director up there i would say and again my historical reference is somewhat limited to having just bought the company a year ago but i would tell you that based on the limited numbers of suppliers up there i mean it s not as if it s like in the stage where you ve got seven manufacturers you can pull from there s really only two or three depending on which part of the country you re talking about to pull from so i don t see any big alterations necessarily in terms of the pricing environment and frankly i think the production would be adjusted based on the demand levels anyway kind of like what you here so i don t see any big price adjustments necessarily taking place up there trey grooms stephens analyst okay thanks for taking my questions i ll turn it over good luck g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thank you trey thanks operator thank you our next question comes from the line of keith hughes with suntrust please proceed with your question keith hughes suntrust analyst thank you my congratulations to you mike and good luck i m sure the golfing industry will see its rounds go up once you head into retirement g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thanks keith keith hughes suntrust analyst just building on a couple of questions that have come in specifically turning to the ceilings industry you ve had some very strong numbers here that is similar to what we saw or better volume what we saw out of armstrong i guess my question is as the speciality business ramps up in ceilings they usg and others have been doing that can you tell us how that benefits gms is there any of that business you missed because it s all direct or how does that work out for you g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director the speciality side keith hughes suntrust analyst yeah speciality side of the business yes g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director you know that we talked about this a little bit before i mean if you look at the gross there s always this conversation around the commodity product and what s the long term growth prospects of that but the reality is is that we ve seen very significant growth in the specialty wood metal ceilings the accoutrements to open platform ceilings for example with the acoustical clouds and things such as that and so i think and i really have to tip my hat to our guys in the field who ve dedicated a lot of resources and energy behind those segments of the business because it requires technical expertise it requires a lot of product knowledge and in many respects we become kind of consultants for even architects as they re trying to design a lot of these more sophisticated spaces so we ve committed a lot of resources to that segment and i think we re yielding the results of that the as products are a key part of the growth story and the other part of it is to just the fundamental r r side and the fact that you ve got that annuity factor built in because of the replacement of either tiles that are damaged due to a water pipe failure or somebody that s building out three new floors there s just kind of a there s an ongoing activity level particularly given the relative strength to commercial right now so it s kind of a combination to factors but the specialty side the architectural specialty side is definitely a growth area for us keith hughes suntrust analyst okay and switching to titan do you think the next couple of quarters where you see your titan business bottom out or were there still be some downside in business as you try to search for a bottom in canada a lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yeah sure keith on the bottom in canada a couple of things first of all our exposure there is 22 of the demand is single family is new single family we certainly hope to see things turn in the next two or three quarters one thing that s starting to turn already canada i think you guys know has a higher lumber business than the us businesses do and we ve already started to see some of the lumber prices start to turn around so don t know where the bottom is we hope that it s now and fully expect to see things start to turn around however it will take a little bit of time for the factors that we discussed related to single family to earn themselves out keith hughes suntrust analyst okay final question on sg a now that you been on titan on for a year do you think there ll be more as you go into year two of ownership will there be more sg a savings less leverage and we would see that tick down for the whole company synergies are we kind of past that g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director well i mean i think on the synergy front that s an ongoing effort it s kind of like we had our first bite at the apple so to speak but as we continue to grow our businesses together we find more opportunities to purchase cross border from the same manufacturers or even new manufacturers we re going to find more opportunities to find synergies and i think frankly is the revenue and expense mix improves as single family comes back and i think you re going to see more opportunities for sg a leverage in the future but that s a tbd there but i i m fundamentally optimistic and i would reiterate as i said earlier the acquisition of titan was and is a very very sound and strategically significant investment for us so while there is some short term hiccups in the business long term it s accretive now and it will continue to grow would be accretive in the future keith hughes suntrust analyst okay thank you very much and good luck again g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thanks keith appreciate it operator thank you our next question comes from the line of michael wood with nomura instinet please proceed with your question michael wood nomura instinet analyst thanks mike it s been a pleasure working with you and congratulations on a well deserved retirement g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director yeah thanks mike appreciate it michael wood nomura instinet analyst first i wanted to get some just more sg a details if you wouldn t mind the wage inflation maybe where exactly that s coming from that s an industry phenomenon or gms specific and maybe some of the timing of the corporate expenses in terms of details on what s driving that when that might come down a lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yeah sure on the first question that you asked with respect to the wage inflation this it s a real thing across the industry it s driven by labor shortages that are pretty significant in construction it s not just the gms thing most of the economies in which we operate are a full employment economy so we re seeing that primarily in logistics but also in other costs related to your question on the timing really nothing ominous just simply year over year timing of certain expenses as well as some unanticipated and unexpected insurance claims that took place the last quarter of the year the last actually in april michael wood nomura instinet analyst thanks and on the favorable price cost that you called out can you just give us some details on that perhaps quantify your cost inflation where that was running just in terms of the gross margin impact a lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller no we re not we can t really quantify the impact of the favorability of price cost we did have some some nice tailwinds from the purchasing synergies as a result of the titan acquisition so really i think the remainder of the increase was due to price cost and the mix michael wood nomura instinet analyst okay but just to understand the sustainability of the low double digit ebitda conversion margins that you achieve which is in line with your long term expectation is that something that you think is sustainable going forward trying to just understand the price cost was sort of like a one time benefit that benefit might win a lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yeah so moving forward we fully expect to be in the 10 to 15 range for incremental adjusted ebitda and we think that s very achievable so we do believe that is sustainable michael wood nomura instinet analyst okay thank you a lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yeah just to qualify that with of course that depends on the pricing environment and on titan s performance as well operator thank you our next question comes from the line of mike dahl with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst good morning thanks for taking my questions and mike and john congrats to you both g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thanks michael john c turner president thank you mike mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst so i wanted to pick up on the titan conversation with the first question i think the business was run rating something around 460 million and 15 ebitda margins on an ltm basis when you bought it clearly some moving pieces since then can you just help us size up what the current run rate on sales and profitability is for the business a lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yeah sure sales is 15 of the total and in terms of level of detail as we ve discussed on previous calls we re not prepared to provide that level of detail mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst got it ok i was shifting gears wallboard pricing mike you mentioned that you re seeing stability in the market today i guess and just looking for a little clarity on that if you could provide a little more detail on the pricing intra quarter and is there anything we should be thinking about in terms of exit rate on pricing that s different from the 324 million ph for the quarterly average a lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller can you reframe the question mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst yeah sure so i think the comment suggested that there s been sequential stabilisation in pricing i guess that the ppi data has kind of continued to move lower sequentially for the manufacturers so your quarterly price was 324 million ph i m just wondering if the exit price if we should be thinking that the price was kind of falling through the quarter so that even if we re stabilising today we could see another down tick in the quarterly price next quarter i just want to make sure we re on the right page there a lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yeah it s a possibility again there s a lot of uncertainty with respect to what we talked about with respect to the pricing environment g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director and it also depends on the mix because that s based on that s exactly number two so i would say that there is no big moves that we re seeing at the parent right now and i think based on the supply demand predictability right now that we re the pricing is generally stable but trying to handicap that going forward is pretty difficult to do at this juncture mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst okay got it if i could get one last question and just on sg a i think you highlighted both the comments in the presentation is the unanticipated costs and timing of certain other costs can you quantify how much of it impact that was in the quarter and kind of how to think about and you re lapping some of the benefits as you mentioned in early fiscal 20 but just how to think about what to expect for sg a moving forward a lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yeah in terms of the mix of the so we got 100 basis points of leverage we would have reforecast to get 200 basis points of leverage year over year the 100 basis points of like let s call it nav ph was half and half due to titan a not being as big of a portion of the business and b not having the ability to leverage its own fixed costs to the extent that we had forecast and the other half being the insurance costs and the timing of a corporate expenses that we talked about going forward we certainly hope to get some leverage how much under our current run rate it is it s really dependent on wage inflation as well as on titan performance mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst okay makes sense thank you all g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thanks mike operator thank you our next question comes from the line of david manthey with baird please proceed with your question david manthey robert w baird analyst thank you hi and mike congratulations and good luck g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thanks david david manthey robert w baird analyst question on to get at these one timers another way here maybe could you just give us the magnitude of the insurance and the timing of other costs sort of year over year what the magnitude of that impact was and then i assume what you re signaling here is that we should get relief on both of those as we move into the first quarter they were sort of periodic to the fourth quarter is that correct a lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yes that is correct g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director yeah david manthey robert w baird analyst and in terms of magnitude basis points or dollars any can you give us an idea of what they were a lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yeah sure 50 basis points was the insurance costs and the timing of certain corporate expenses and 50 basis points was the titan impact david manthey robert w baird analyst okay all right got it g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director give or take yeah a lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller give or take david manthey robert w baird analyst okay that sounds good and then second on pricing it sounds like you re sort of signaling maybe flattish wallboard pricing in fiscal 2020 but could you talk about the ceiling prices will we see another strong quarter coming up here and i m just trying to get an idea of the timing when you lap the prior price increases and i assume at some point you will revert back to sort of the 3 to 5 norm there and then i know it s a long question but just mainly ceiling pricing and timing and then second is steel prices is it possible you could actually see a drag from steel prices this year g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director well as it relates to wallboard i mean i m not smart enough to project out that the entire year 20 will like to see wallboard increases so i mean i i don t want to go record i think say that again a lot of that has to do with demand supply conditions and just overall activity level so that certainly could have an influence as to longer term wallboard pricing on the ceilings front everything that we re seeing in terms of quote activity and backlog and in the general attitude of our folks out in the field is that we re going to continue to see growth in ceilings going forward just based on the current volumes and as we ve discussed on previous calls i mean there is pretty much kind of a built in price increase relative to ceilings year in and year out i mean you get two increases a year and it s fairly predictable so i mean i think our outlook on the ceilings front and our growth and frankly our investments in people and resources to grow that business you can see the fruits of those efforts already and i would see that continuing into the future david manthey robert w baird analyst and then on steal mike g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director yeah steel i tell you dave steel is it s really slept down we ve seen some slippage downward it s obviously prices have fallen and i think when you look at the current market relative to scrap and the availability of ship scrap offshore is limited i would say that our view is that steel prices and i m talking specifically now about the steel the structural side i think we re probably going to see that continue to probably drop in terms of price as we go forward david manthey robert w baird analyst okay thank you g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thanks operator thank you our next question comes from the line of kevin hocevar with northcoast research please proceed with your question kevin hocevar northcoast research analyst hey good morning everybody and congratulations as well to mike and john g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thanks kevin kevin hocevar northcoast research analyst wondering if you could comment on cash usage expectations here in 2020 it seems like debt paydown is the priority but obviously still doing acquisitions and a little bit of share repurchases as well so you can kind of frame up for us as your expectations there and where do you think you can get that net leverage looks like you took off 0 6 from what 4 2 to 3 6 i think this year how much further down do you think you can draw that in fiscal 20 a lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yeah we ll continue to operate using our balance capital allocation approach debt paydown remains a priority we ve talked about our target of a 3 0 the exact timing of that 3 0 obviously depends on the generation of adjusted ebitda if you look from where we were right after the titan deal 4 2 really we re halfway there now so we ll continue to do that in terms of the in terms of the share repurchases we will continue to be opportunistic about share repurchases and we ll continue to be selective about strategic acquisition we think that s an important part of our growth story g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director yeah i would add to that kevin if you look at this quarter to me i think it s kind of a perfect example of this balance strategy that we re approaching i mean it s not an all or nothing proposition we ve got to have the right balance between delevering which we clearly understand is a priority but at the same time as opportunities present themselves whether it s commercial builders whether it s hard or whether it s greenfields we have to continue to run the business long term strategically and as things present themselves from a stock price standpoint we capitalize on that as well i think just a really good picture of how we can do that and at the same time continue to drive down that debt level so that s going to be the strategy going forward kevin hocevar northcoast research analyst yeah okay great and then mike you mentioned the strength you saw here in the fiscal fourth quarter carrying forward into may and june just kind of curious if you can comment on that specifically are you seeing pretty similar growth rates are you seeing any accelerations or decelerations just wondering if you can elaborate that on that a little bit g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director well i mean i think just as a general statement there is a solid level of momentum certainly going into may june just kind of early to tell because we haven t wrapped up all the numbers obviously and that kind of thing but just in talking with the field and meeting with the customers and looking at frankly a lot of the larger commercial folks who were completely booked out for 19 and going into 20 our view is the overall activity level is solid there and even with some of the softness if you want to call it that in single family we re still stocking at an enormous number of units of housing right now in multi family so pretty much broad based i just say that the activity level and the outlook is just very positive is it it s not like a hockey stick or some massive growth but it s just a real solid environment right now and i think the outlook is very positive a lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yeah i just add sequentially during the quarter and continuing into may we saw sequential increases in our sales per day so we re pretty positive about that little bit too early to tell in june since we re still in the month g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director right right kevin hocevar northcoast research analyst got you okay thank you very much g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thanks kevin operator thank you our next question comes from the line of matt mccall with seaport global securities please proceed with your question reuben garner seaport global securities analyst thanks good morning everybody and it s actually reuben on for matt congrats mike and john to you both g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thanks reuben reuben garner seaport global securities analyst most of my questions have been answered just one follow up if i could you mentioned still targeting kind of 10 to 15 of ebitda contribution margin going into this year is there a clarification does that include kind of any pressures that would result from wsb declining i assume that s a higher margin business probably has higher contribution margins does that include any pressure from there that s maybe offset by some synergies or and or any maybe savings if there were to be continued pressure in the canadian business a lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yeah sure the 10 to 15 incremental ebitda contribution does include our forecast which we expect to titan reuben garner seaport global securities analyst okay great and that s all i got everything else was answered thank you guys g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thanks operator thank you our final question comes from the line of truman patterson with wells fargo please proceed with your question truman patterson wells fargo analyst hi good morning everybody thanks for squeezing me in here mike let me add my congratulations i hope you enjoy retirement so g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director yeah thanks truman i appreciate it truman patterson wells fargo analyst yeah first off on the wallboard volumes you know up in the 3 range seems like that s a pretty good result given what s going on with canada s housing starts decline the us starts are down so a pretty good result i guess how do you guys think about your market share there you guys have been maintaining it or even picking up a little bit of market share here in the us g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director i would say as a general statement we feel like we re kind of holding our we re holding our share position if you look at particularly on a 12 month run rate relative to the ga numbers and kind of where we see our numbers coming in so the the growth rates we re very happy with on the organic side frankly there was also some deferred work that got pushed out you ve heard and seen all the things about weather and this and that the reality is there was deferred work that we ve really picked up on as well going into this quarter so it s kind of a combination of factors but we re confident that our share position we re pretty much holding firm a lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yeah i just i would just echo that and say that kind of i read through the gypsum association data which obviously has a lot of noise in it we actually think we might have seen some positive movement on share so we re pretty positive about that truman patterson wells fargo analyst okay great thanks for that and then looking at your greenfields you guys opened four during the quarter seems like you guys are picking up that activity a little bit over the past year could you just walk us through the economics of opening a new branch and kind of the timeline of revenues and cash flows until break even and performing in line with more established branches a lynn ross interim chief financial officer chief accounting officer and corporate controller yeah so in terms of greenfields we still think that the 6 to 8 guide is a generally good guide we did have 8 this year i think it s reasonable to expect that in 20 we ll have that number in terms of the economics of it it s a fairly nominal capital investment there is a period of ramp let s say 12 to 24 months truman patterson wells fargo analyst okay is there any way we can think about kind of the revenue ramp and how long it takes to get a greenfield branch to kind of the average overall branch level g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director maybe 24 maybe just 24 months little bit over 24 i mean the reality is that most of these greenfields as you know we ve talked about the four terminal they re extensions of existing platforms where we might shift x percent of volume from an existing operation with greenfield site i would say that it s a minimal amount of capital investment you re probably good get doing normalized run rate of a couple of years maybe 2 5 years get it on a full run rate basis as a standard branch so to speak truman patterson wells fargo analyst okay g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director but you also in the near term you re picking up logistical benefits because of obviously opening up a new location not trans shipping or going to long distances and that kind of thing truman patterson wells fargo analyst okay thank you operator thank you there are no further questions at this time i would like to turn the call back over to mr callahan for any closing remarks g michael callahan president chief executive officer and director thank you well thank you all for joining us today again i really appreciated working with many of you since our ipo in 2016 and i thank all of our shareholders for their continued support of gms i wish john and the gms team all the best in the future and i look forward to seeing them bring gms to

toronto june 27 2019 globe newswire yamana gold inc tsx yri nyse auy yamana or the company today announced an increase to the three year guidance for its wholly owned jacobina mine and an update on its two phased plan to further increase production thereby improving the strategic life of mine the following tables present the company s increased production expectations for jacobina in 2019 2020 2021 and cost guidance for 2019 excluding further potential upside from the phase 2 expansion described below and any benefit from higher grade ore increases in production are only attributable to implementation of the phase 1 expansion which is now in progress 2018 actual 2019 guidance 2020 guidance 2021 guidance jacobina gold production oz 144 695 152 000 160 000 170 000 previous oz 145 000 total cost of sales per geo sold 2 3 cash costs 1 3 per geo sold aisc 1 2 3 per geo sold 2018 actual 2019 guidance 2018 actual 2019 guidance 2018 actual 2019 guidance jacobina 967 1 005 675 700 891 890 refers to a non gaap financial measure or an additional line item or subtotal in financial statements reconciliations for all non gaap financial measures are available at www yamana com q12019 and in section 10 of the company s first quarter 2019 management s discussion analysis which has been filed on sedar mine site aisc all in sustaining costs includes cash costs mine site general and administrative expense sustaining capital capitalized exploration and expensed exploration consolidated aisc incorporates additional non mine site costs including corporate general and administrative expense yamana reports costs on a gold equivalent ounce basis jacobina produces only gold therefore in the case of jacobina gold equivalent ounces are equal to gold ounces the company is one year ahead of schedule in its plans to increase sustainable production to 150 000 ounces per year and now forecasts life of mine production of over 170 000 ounces per year after 2021 guidance for 2019 capital costs remains unchanged furthermore the company expects a similar level of total capital spending during 2020 all amounts are expressed in united states dollars unless otherwise indicated jacobina phase 1 update phase 1 involves a modest plant optimization to increase throughput to a sustainable level of 6 500 tonnes per day tpd by mid 2020 this optimization is ahead of schedule with quarter to date throughput averaging 6 182 tpd thereby allowing the company to increase its guidance this compares to average daily throughput of 5 580 tpd in 2018 optimization work completed to date includes improving grinding and crushing with the installation of an advanced process control system with monitoring devices for the mill and crushing circuit further initiatives to reduce plant maintenance downtime were completed in may remaining work for phase 1 is well advanced commissioning of a high frequency sieve and an induction furnace is expected in the third quarter and commissioning of two gravimetric concentrators and a cyclone battery to feed the thickener is expected by the first quarter of 2020 as of the end of june the remaining project capital costs to complete phase 1 are approximately 3 4 million approximately 2 million of these costs included in previously guided capital spending will be spent over the balance of 2019 with the remainder in 2020 phase 1 is expected to increase the gold production rate to approximately 170 000 ounces per year by 2021 at the current mineral reserves grade a 21 increase compared to original 2019 production guidance of 145 000 ounces per year following completion of the mill optimization there is potential for a further production increase driven by higher grades in 2019 exploration work has focused on supporting the planned expansion and targeting new mineral resources at a grade of 3 0 grams per tonne g t or better at year end 2018 proven and probable mineral reserves totaled 2 1 million ounces of gold contained in 27 9 million tonnes at an average grade of 2 34 g t measured and indicated mineral resources were 3 2 million ounces of gold contained in 40 7 million tonnes at 2 47 g t and inferred mineral resources totaled 1 0 million ounces contained in 12 1 million tonnes at 2 58 g t the mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates for jacobina at december 31 2018 are set out below updated mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates at jacobina are expected to be provided in the third quarter of 2019 the update will incorporate infill drilling of the higher grade inferred mineral resources at joão belo canavieiras sul morro do cuscuz and morro do vento assuming an increase in grade for the updated mineral reserves sustainable production resulting from phase 1 has the potential to exceed the 170 000 gold ounces per year production level while the updated guidance shows incremental production increases in the next three years resulting from the staged throughput increases as phase 1 is fully implemented the phase 1 expansion creates a sustainable production level of at least 170 000 gold ounces per year for the life of mine after the three year guidance period based on current mineral reserve grades which would further increase with grade improvements jacobina phase 2 update the phase 2 plant expansion is expected to result in a larger increase in plant capacity with a likely scenario in the range of 7 500 tpd to 8 500 tpd while maintaining gold recoveries of between 96 97 the higher throughput would gradually increase jacobina s gold production to at least 200 000 ounces per year and up to 225 000 ounces per year by 2023 based on current mineral reserve grades a pre feasibility study pfs to identify optimum mining and processing expansion scenarios evaluate project economics and determine a project development schedule including the timing for permit applications is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2020 investment for phase 2 is expected to occur mostly in 2021 and 2022 with the objective of being at the higher throughput level at the beginning of 2023 no expansionary capital will be committed to the plant expansion until the pfs is completed the company s hurdle requirement for expenditure on the phase 2 expansion is an after tax irr exceeding 15 the decision to proceed with the investment will be driven by the expansion of the plant throughput thus bringing forward cash flows but also an extension of mine life from continued exploration success and improvements to jacobina s average mineral reserve grade which would support the investment decision to this end the company has approved a 3 million increase to jacobina s exploration budget for the balance of 2019 and builds on the success from the 2018 program a dedicated exploration update for jacobina will be provided during the third quarter of 2019 jacobina has improved significantly in the last several years across all measures and it is now one of our higher quality high value operations said daniel racine president and chief executive officer of yamana we believe that it is on the cusp of becoming a world class mine particularly once a decision is made to proceed with the phase 2 expansion given strong production production growth increasing mineral inventory at improving grades and continuous increases in cash flow the planned expansion at jacobina is the continuation of a series of incremental improvements that have been successfully implemented over the past four years during which gold production increased from 75 000 ounces in 2014 to 145 000 ounces in 2018 the following table shows the incremental gold production growth trend that yamana is targeting with the phase 1 and phase 2 expansions these objectives are based on increase in throughput only and do not include further upside for an increase in grade as a result of exploration 2018 actual 2019 guidance 2020 guidance 2021 guidance 2022 objective 2023 objective jacobina

update is planned before the end of the year corporate overhead improvements yamana has been critically evaluating its general and administrative g a expenses to align its cost structure to its remaining portfolio of assets as the chapada sale is expected to be completed within the next few weeks the company now expects 2019 g a expenses on a cash basis to be lowered to 68 million compared with previous guidance of 75 million implying a run rate of approximately 60 million per year the company expects g a expenses to remain at 60 million in 2020 resulting in savings of over 15 million annually and the company anticipates that further reductions will be realized through optimizations and cost reduction initiatives these savings will be realized from the direct impact of the chapada sale and adjustments resulting from a smaller regional presence in brazil furthermore the company s overall organizational structure is being streamlined across south america in particular and over the entire organization more generally the anticipated saving from the g a initiatives that we are implementing align with the strategic rationale of the chapada sale racine said they will further strengthen our balance sheet and improve our financial flexibility and they will simplify our organizational structure to match the company s remaining portfolio of five mines upcoming events the company would like to highlight a number of notable upcoming events and milestones these include the pre feasibility study for agua rica the completion of the chapada sale expected in early july

a slate of 10 democrats vying to become their party s nominee for president faced one another on wednesday in miami the first of two nights of debate among the 2020 candidates below is a transcript of the two hour event which we ll update throughout the night click on the yellow highlighted text to see highlights from the fix via genius nbc anchor savannah guthrie all right so with that business out of the way we want to get to it and we ll start this evening with senator elizabeth warren senator good evening to you sen elizabeth warren d mass thank you good to be here guthrie you have many plans free college free child care government health care cancellation of student debt new taxes new regulations the breakup of major corporations but this comes at a time when 71 percent of americans say the economy is doing well including 60 percent of democrats what do you say to those who worry this kind of significant change could be risky to the economy advertisement warren so i think of it this way who is this economy really working for it s doing great for a thinner and thinner slice at the top it s doing great for giant drug companies it s just not doing great for people who are trying to get a prescription filled it s doing great for people who want to invest in private prisons just not for the african americans and latinx whose families are torn apart whose lives are destroyed and whose communities are ruined it s doing great for giant oil companies that want to drill everywhere just not for the rest of us who are watching climate change bear down upon us when you ve got a government when you ve got an economy that does great for those with money and isn t doing great for everyone else that is corruption pure and simple we need to call it out we need to attack it head on and we need to make structural change in our government in our economy and in our country advertisement applause guthrie senator klobuchar you ve called programs like free college something you might do if you were quote a magic genie to be blunt are the government programs and benefits that some of your rivals are offering giving your voters people a false sense of what s actually achievable sen amy klobuchar d minn well first the economy we know that not everyone is sharing in this prosperity and donald trump just sits in the white house and gloats about what s going on when you have so many people that are having trouble affording college and having trouble affording their premiums so i do get concerned about paying for college for rich kids i do but i think my plan is a good one and my plan would be to first of all make community college free and make sure that everyone else besides that top percentile gets help with their education advertisement my own dad and my sister got their first degrees with community college there s many paths to success as well as certifications secondly i d used pell grants i d double them from 6 000 to 12 000 a year and expand it to the number of families that get covered to families that make up to 100 000 and then the third thing i would do is make it easier for students to pay off their student loans because i can tell you this if billionaires can pay off their yachts students should be able to pay off their student loans guthrie that s time thank you applause congressman o rourke what we ve just been discussing and talking about is how much fundamental change to the economy is desirable and how much is actually doable in that vein some democrats want a marginal individual tax rate of 70 percent on the very highest earners those making more than 10 million a year would you support that and if not what would your top individual rate be advertisement o rourke this economy has got to work for everyone and right now we know that it isn t and it s going to take all of us coming together to make sure that it does speaking in spanish o rourke right now we have a system that favors those who can pay for access and outcomes that s how you explain an economy that is rigged to corporations and to the very wealthiest a 2 trillion tax cut that favored corporations while they were sitting on record piles of cash and the very wealthiest in this country at a time of historic wealth inequality a new democracy that is revived because we ve returned power to the people no pacs no gerrymandering automatic and same day voter registration to bring in more voters and a new voting rights act to get rid of the barriers that are in place now advertisement guthrie congressman o rourke beto o rourke that s how we each have a voice in our democracy and make this economy work for everybody guthrie congressman that s time sir applause i ll give you 10 seconds to answer if you want to answer the direct question would you support a 70 percent individual marginal tax rate yes no or pass o rourke i would support a tax rate and a tax code that is fair to everyone tax capital at the same right guthrie seventy percent o rourke that you you tax ordinary income take that corporate tax rate up to 28 percent you would generate the revenues guthrie okay that s time o rourke you need to pay for the programs we re talking about guthrie that s time thank you senator booker there is a debate in this party right now about the role of corporations as you know senator warren in particular put out a plan to break up tech companies like facebook amazon and google you ve said we should not quote be running around pointing at companies and breaking them up without any kind of process why do you disagree advertisement sen cory booker d n j i don t think i disagree i think we have a serious problem in our country with corporate consolidation and you see the evidence of that in how dignity is being stripped from labor and we have people that work full time jobs and still can t make a living wage we see that because consumer prices are being raised by pharmaceutical companies that often have monopolistic holds on drugs and you see that by just the fact that this is actually an economy that s hurting small businesses and not allowing them to compete one of the most aggressive bills in the senate to deal with corporate consolidation is mine about corporate consolidation in the ag sector so i feel very strongly about the need to check the corporate consolidation and let the free market work and i ll tell you this i live in a low income black and brown community i see every single day that this economy is not working for average americans the indicators that are being used from gdp to wall street s rankings is not helping people in my community it is about time that we have an economy that works for everybody not just the wealthiest in our nation advertisement guthrie but quickly senator booker you did say that you didn t think it was right to name names to name companies and single them out as senator warren has briefly why is that booker well again i will single out companies like halliburton or amazon that pay nothing in taxes and our need to change that and when it comes to antitrust law what i will do is number one appoint judges that will enforce it number two have a doj and a federal trade commission that will go through the processes necessary to check this kind of corporate concentration at the end of the day we have too much of a problem with corporate power growing we see that with everything from citizens united and the way they re trying to influence washington it s about time that we have a president that fights for the people in this country advertisement guthrie that s time sir booker we need to have someone that s a champion for them guthrie thank you senator senator warren i mentioned you applause guthrie are you picking winners and losers warren so the way i understand this it s there is way too much consolidation now in giant industries in this country that hurts workers it hurts small businesses it hurts independent farmers it hurts our economy overall and it helps constrict real innovation and growth in this economy now look we ve had the laws out there for a long time to be able to fight back what s been missing is courage courage in washington to take on the giants that s part of the corruption in this system it has been far too long that the monopolies have been making the campaign contributions have been funding the super pacs have been out there making sure that their influence is heard and felt in every single decision that gets made in washington where i want to start this is i want to return government to the people and that means calling out the names of the monopolists and saying i have the courage to go after them guthrie thank you applause nbc host lester holt secretary castro the next question is for you democrats have been talking about the pay gap for decades what would you do to ensure that women are paid fairly in this country julián castro thank you very much for that question lester you know i grew up with a mother who raised my brother joaquin and me as a single parent and i know what it s like to struggle i know what it s like to rent a home and to worry about whether you re going to be able to pay the rent at the first of the month and to see a mom work very very hard and know that moms across this country are getting paid less simply because they re women i would do several things starting with something we should have done a long time ago which is to pass the equal rights amendment finally in this country applause and also pursue legislation so that women are paid equal pay for equal work in this country it s past time that we did that applause and you know we have to do this if we want to be the most prosperous nation in the 21st century we need to make sure that women are paid what they deserve holt all right thank you i want to put the same question to congresswoman gabbard your thoughts on equal pay rep tulsi gabbard d hawaii first of all let s recognize the situation we re in that the american people deserve a president who will put your interests ahead of the rich and powerful that s not what we have right now i enlisted in the army national guard after the al qaida terror attacks on 9 11 so i could go after those who had attacked us on that day i still serve as a major i served over 16 years deployed twice to the middle east and in congress served on the foreign affairs and armed services affairs for over six years i know the importance of our national security as well as the terribly high cost of war and for too long our leaders have failed us taking us from one regime change war to the next leading us into a new cold war and arms race costing us trillions of our hard earned taxpayer dollars and countless lives this insanity must end as president i will take your hard earned taxpayer dollars and instead invest those dollars into serving your needs things like health care a green economy good paying jobs protecting our environment and so much more applause nbc anchor jose diaz balart mayor de blasio good evening you re the mayor of the biggest city in the united states but it s also one of the cities in the country with the greatest gap between the wealthy and the poor how would you address income inequality new york mayor bill de blasio well we ve been addressing income inequality in new york city by raising wages by raising benefits by putting money back in the hands of working people 15 minimum wage paid sick days pre k for all things that are making a huge difference in working people s lives but let me tell you what we re hearing here already in the first round of questions is that battle for the heart and soul of our party i want to make it clear this is supposed to be the party of working people yes we re supposed to be for a 70 percent tax rate on the wealthy yes we re supposed to be for free college free public college for our young people we are supposed to break up big corporations when they re not serving our democracy this democratic party has to be strong and bold and progressive and in new york we ve proven that we can do something very different we can put money back in the hands of working people and let me tell you every time you talk about investing in people and their communities you hear folks say there s not enough money what i say to them every single time is there s plenty of money in this world there s plenty of money in this country it s just in the wrong hands democrats have to fix that applause diaz balart congressman delaney do you agree john delaney i think we have to do real things to help american workers and the american people right this is the issue that all of us hear on the campaign trail we need to make sure everyone has a living wage and i ve called for a doubling of the earned income tax credit raising the minimum wage and creating paid family leave that will create a situation where people actually have a living wage that gets right to workers then we ve got to fix our public education system it s not delivering the results our kids needs nor is college and post high school career and technical training programs doing that you know i m very different than everyone else here on the stage prior to being in congress i was an entrepreneur i started two businesses i created thousands of jobs i spent my whole career helping small to mid sized businesses all over the country 5 000 of them i supported the obama administration gave me an award for lending to disadvantaged communities i know how to create jobs we need a short term strategy which is to put money in the pockets of workers with the earned income tax credit raising the minimum wage and creating family leave and then we need to have a long term strategy to make sure this country is competitive and we re creating jobs everywhere in this country diaz balart thank you governor inslee how would you address income inequality gov jay inslee d wash well i m a little bit surprised i think plans are great but i m a governor and we ve got to realize the people who brought us the weekend unions need are going to bring us a long overdue raise in america applause and i m proud of standing up for unions i ve got a plan to reinvigorate collective bargaining so we can increase wages finally i marched with the seiu folks it is not right that the ceo of mcdonald s makes 2 100 times more than the people slinging hash at mcdonald s and the next thing i ll do is put people to work in the jobs of the present and the future look it donald trump is simply wrong he says wind turbines cause cancer we know they cause jobs and we know that we can put millions of people to work in the clean energy jobs of the future carpenters ibew members machinists we re doing it in my state today and then we can do what america always does lead the world and invent the future and put people to work that s what we re going to do crosstalk diaz balart so congressman ryan president trump and you just referred to him promise of manufacturing jobs were all coming back to places like your home state of ohio can you make that same promise rep tim ryan d ohio yes i believe you can but first let s say the president came he said don t sell your house to people in youngstown ohio and then his administration just in the last two years we lost 4 000 4 000 jobs at a general motors facility that rippled throughout our community general motors got a tax cut general motors got a bailout and then they have the audacity to move a new car that they re going to produce to mexico i ve had family members that have to unbolt a machine from the factory floor put it in a box and ship it to china my area where i come from in northeast ohio this issue we re talking about here it s been going on 40 years this is not a new phenomenon in the united states of america the bottom 60 percent haven t seen a raise since 1980 meanwhile the top 1 percent control 90 percent of the wealth we need an industrial policy saying we re going to dominate building electric vehicles there s going to be 30 million made in the next 10 years i want half of them made in the united states i want to dominate the solar industry diaz balart thank you ryan and manufacture those here in the united states diaz balart senator warren are they coming back are these jobs coming back warren so we ve had an industrial policy in the united states for decades now and it s basically been let giant corporations do whatever they want to do giant corporations have exactly one loyalty and that is to profits and if they can save a nickel by moving a job to mexico or to asia or to canada they re going to do it so here s what i propose for an industrial policy start with a place where there s a real need there s going to be a worldwide need for green technology ways to clean up the air ways to clean up the water and we can be the ones to provide that we need to go tenfold in our research and development on green energy going forward applause and then we need to say any corporation can come and use that research they can make all kinds of products from it but they have to be manufactured right here in the united states of america and then we have to double down and sell it around the world there s a 23 trillion market coming for green products we should be the leaders and the owners and we should have that 1 2 million manufacturing jobs here in america diaz balart thank you warren we can do this holt all right we re going to turn to the issue of health care right now and really try to understand where there may or may not be daylight between you many people watching at home have health insurance coverage through their employer who here would abolish their private health insurance in favor of a government run plan just a show of hands start off with applause all right well senator klobuchar let me put the question to you you re one of the democrats who wants to keep private insurance in addition to a government health care plan why is an incremental approach in your view better than a sweeping overhaul klobuchar well i think it s a bold approach it s something that barack obama wanted to do when we were working on the affordable care act and that is a public option i am just simply concerned about kicking half of america off of their health insurance in four years which is exactly what this bill says so let me go on beyond that there is a much bigger issue in addition to that and that is pharmaceuticals the president literally went on tv on fox and said that people s heads would spin when they see how much he would bring down pharmaceutical prices instead 2 500 drugs have gone up in double digits since he came into office instead he gave 100 billion in giveaways to the pharma companies for the rest of us for the rest of america that s what we call at home all foam and no beer we got nothing out of it laughter and so my proposal is to do something about pharma to take them on to allow negotiation under medicare to bring in less expensive drugs from other countries and pharma thinks they own washington well they don t own me holt your time is up thank you applause senator warren you signed on to bernie sanders medicare for all plan it would put essentially everybody on medicare and then eliminate private plans that offer similar coverage is that the plan or path that you would pursue as president warren so yes i m with bernie on medicare for all and let me tell you why i spent a big chunk of my life studying why families go broke and one of the number one reasons is the cost of health care medical bills and that s not just for people who don t have insurance it s for people who have insurance look at the business model of an insurance company it s to bring in as many dollars as they can in premiums and to pay out as few dollars as possible for your health care that leaves families with rising premiums rising copays and fighting with insurance companies to try to get the health care that their doctors say that they and their children need medicare for all solves that problem and i understand there are a lot of politicians who say oh it s just not possible we just can t do it have a lot of political reasons for this what they re really telling you is they just won t fight for it well health care is a basic human right and i will fight for basic human rights crosstalk applause holt congressman o rourke when you ran for senate you also praised a bill that would replace private insurance this year you re saying you re no longer sure can you explain why o rourke my goal is to ensure that every american is well enough to live to their full potential because they have health care in laredo texas i met a young man 27 years old told me that he d been to a doctor once in his life and on that visit he was told he had diabetes he was told he had glaucoma and he was told untreated because he doesn t have health care he ll be dead before the age of 40 so getting to guaranteed high quality universal health care as quickly and surely as possible has to be our goal the ability to afford your prescriptions and go to a primary care provider to be the ability to see a mental health care provider in texas the single largest provider of mental health care services is the county jail system today and health care also has to mean that every woman can make her own decisions about her own body and has access to the care that makes that possible applause our plan says that if you re uninsured we enroll you in medicare if you re insufficiently insured you can t afford your premiums we enroll you in medicare but if you re a member of a union that negotiated for a health care plan that you like because it works for you and your family you re able to keep it holt your time is up o rourke we preserve choice by making sure everybody has care holt your time is up congressman but i do want to ask a follow up on this just to be very clear i ll give you 10 seconds would you replace private insurance o rourke no i think the choice is fundamental to our ability to get everybody cared for de blasio wait wait wait congressman o rourke congressman o rourke private insurance is not working for tens of millions of americans when you talk about the co pays the deductibles the premiums the out of pocket expenses it s not working how can you defend a system that s not working o rourke that s right so for those for whom it s not working they can choose medicare for the crosstalk de blasio congressman o rourke who i listen to de blasio you ve got to start by acknowledging the system is not working for people o rourke they re able to keep them de blasio why are you defending private insurance to begin with delaney 100 million americans say they like their private health insurance by the way it should be noted that 100 million americans i mean i think we should be the party that keeps what s working and fixes what s broken applause i mean doesn t that make sense i mean we should give everyone in this country health care as a basic human right for free full stop but we should also give them the option to buy private insurance why do we have to stand for taking away something from people and also it s bad policy if you go to every hospital in this country and you ask them one question which is how would it have been for you last year if every one of your bills were paid at the medicare rate every single hospital administrator said they would close and the medicare for all bill requires payments to stay at current medicare rates so to some extent we re supporting a bill that will have every hospital closing i mean my dad was a union electrician right i actually grew up in a working class family he loved the health care that the ibew gave him and i just always think about my dad in anything i would do from a policy perspective he d look at me and he d say good job john for getting health care for every american but why are you taking my health care away holt i ve let this i ve let this play out a little bit because i m fascinated to hear the daylight between you congresswoman gabbard why don t you weigh in here gabbard i think we re talking about this in the wrong way you re talking about one bill over another bill really what we re talking about is our objective making sure that every single sick american in this country is able to get the health care that they need i believe medicare for all is the way to do that i also think that employers will recognize how much money will be saved by supporting a medicare for all program a program that will reduce the administrative costs reduce the bureaucratic costs and make sure that everyone gets that quality health care that they need i also think that holt senator gabbard if you if you look at other countries in the world who have universal health care every one of them has some form of a role of private insurance so i think that s what we ve got to look at taking the best of these ideas but making sure unequivocally that no sick american goes without getting the care that they need regardless of how much or little money they have in their pocket holt congresswoman congresswoman thanks applause crosstalk holt let me turn to senator booker on this senator booker explain to me where you are this is hugely important to people so tell us where you are booker i absolutely will first of all we re talking about this as a health care issue but in communities like mine low income communities it s an education issue because kids who don t have health care are not going to succeed in school it is an issue for jobs and employment because people who do not have good health care do not succeed at work it s even a retirement issue because in my community african americans have a lower life expectancy because of poorer health care and so where i stand is very clear health care it s not just a human right it should be an american right and i believe the best way to get there is medicare for all but i have an urgency about this when i am president of the united states i m not going to wait we have to do the things immediately that are going to provide better care and on this debate i m sorry there are too many people profiteering off of the pain of people in america from pharmaceutical companies to insurers literally the overhead for insurance that they charge is 15 percent while medicare s overhead is only at 2 percent we can do this better and every single day i will be fighting to give people more access and more affordable costs until we get to my goal holt your time is up senator booker which is every american having health care crosstalk holt time is up senator i want to crosstalk holt i want to move back if i can to congresswoman gabbard crosstalk warren point though and that is that the insurance companies last year alone sucked 23 billion in profits out of the health care system 23 billion and that doesn t count the money that was paid to executives the money that was spent lobbying washington we have a giant industry that wants our health care system to stay the way it is because it s not working for families but it s sure as heck working for them crosstalk warren it s time for us to make families come first inslee it should not be an option in the united states of america for any insurance company to deny a woman coverage for their exercise of their right of choice applause and i am the only candidate here who has passed a law protecting a woman s right of reproductive health in health insurance and i m the only candidate who has passed a public option and i respect everybody s goals and plans here but we do have one candidate that s actually advanced the ball and we ve got to have access for everyone i ve done it as a public option holt your time crosstalk holt senator klobuchar i want to get you applause unknown that s a false claim holt i am fascinated by this senator senator klobuchar klobuchar i just want to say there s three women up here that have fought pretty hard for a woman s right to choose i ll start with that applause and then i just want to make very clear i think we share the goal of universal health care and the idea i put out there the public option which the governor was just talking about this idea is that you use medicare or medicaid without any insurance companies involved you can do it either way and the estimates are 13 million people would see a reduction in their premiums 12 more million people would get covered so i think it is a beginning and the way you start and the way you move to universal health care crosstalk holt secretary castro this one is for you all of you on stage support a woman s right to an abortion you all support some version of a government health care option would your plan cover abortion mr secretary castro yes it would i don t believe only in reproductive freedom i believe in reproductive justice applause and you know what that means is that just because a woman or let s also not forget someone in the trans community a trans female is poor doesn t mean they shouldn t have the right to exercise that right to choose and so i absolutely would cover the right to have an abortion more than that everybody in this crowd and watching at home knows that in our country today a person s right to choose is under assault in places like missouri in alabama in georgia i would appoint judges to the federal bench that understand the precedent of roe v wade and will respect it applause and in addition to that make sure that we fight hard as we transition our health care system to one where everybody can get and exercise that right holt senator warren would you put limits on any limits on abortion warren i would make certain that every woman has access to the full range of reproductive health care services and that includes birth control it includes abortion it includes everything for a woman applause and i want to add on that it s not enough for us to expect the courts to protect us forty seven years ago roe v wade was decided and we ve all looked to the courts all that time as state after state has undermined roe has put in exceptions has come right up to the edge of taking away protections holt your time is up senator warren we now have an america where most people support roe v wade we need to make that a federal law holt senator thank you jose diaz balart lester thank you senator booker i want to kind of come back on a discussion we were having about health and the opioid crisis you represent a state where 14 of the 20 largest pharmaceutical companies are based should pharmaceutical companies that manufacture these drugs be held criminally liable for what they do booker they should absolutely be held criminally liable because they are liable and responsible this is one of the reasons why well before i was running for president i said i would not take contributions from pharma companies not take contributions from corporate pacs or pharma executives because they are part of this problem and this opioid addiction in our country we in cities like mine have been seeing how we ve tried to arrest our way out of addiction for too long it is time that we have a national urgency to deal with this problem and make the solutions that are working to actually be the law of our land and make the pharmaceutical companies that are responsible help to pay for that diaz balart congressman o rourke how would you deal with it o rourke tonight in this country you have 2 3 million of our fellow americans behind bars it s the largest prison population on the face of the planet many are there for nonviolent drug crimes including possession of marijuana at a time that more than half the states have legalized it or decriminalized it and yet despite what purdue pharma has done their connection to the opioid crisis and the overdose deaths that we re seeing throughout this country they ve been able to act with complete impunity and pay no consequences not a single night in jail unless there s accountability and justice this crisis will continue in my administration we will hold them to account we will make sure that they pay a price and we will help those who ve been victims of this malfeasance in this country get them treatment and long term care holt i know immigration is on a lot of your minds here applause and i want to talk about it we re going to talk about it in a moment we need to take a break we ll be back with more from miami after this commercial break diaz balart we want to turn to an issue that has been in the news especially this week there are undocumented children being held alone in detention even as close as homestead florida right here less than 30 miles from where we are tonight fathers and mothers and children are dying while trying to enter the united states of america we saw that image today that broke our hearts and they had names oscar martinez and his 23 month old daughter valeria died trying to cross the river to ask for asylum in this country last month more than 130 000 migrants were apprehended at the southern border secretary castro if you were president today hoy what would you specifically do castro thank you very much jose i m very proud that in april i became the first candidate to put forward a comprehensive immigration plan and we saw those images applause watching that image of oscar and his daughter valeria is heartbreaking it should also piss us all off applause if i were president today and it should spur us to action if i were president today i would sign an executive order that would get rid of trump s zero tolerance policy the remain in mexico policy and the metering policy this metering policy is basically what prompted oscar and valeria to make that risky swim across the river they had been playing games with people who are coming and trying to seek asylum at our ports of entry oscar and valeria went to a port of entry and then they were denied the ability to make an asylum claim so they got frustrated and they tried to cross the river and they died because of that diaz balart on day one sorry i m just going to ask crosstalk castro on day one i would do that executive order that would address metering and then i would follow that up in my first 100 days with immigration reform that would honor asylum claims that would put undocumented immigrants as long as they haven t committed a serious crime on a pathway to citizenship and then we d get to the root cause of the issue which is we need a marshall plan for honduras and guatemala and el salvador so that people can find safety and opportunity at home instead of coming to the united states to seek it applause diaz balart senator booker what would you do on day one and this is a situation that the next president will inherit booker yes speaking in spanish on day one i will make sure that number one we end the ice policies and the customs and border policies that are violating the human rights when people come to this country they do not leave their human rights at the border number two applause i will make sure that we reinstate daca that we reinstate pathways to citizenship for daca recipients and to make sure that people that are here on temporary protective status can stay and remain here and then finally we need to make sure that we address the issues that made oscar and valeria come in the first place by making major investments in the northern triangle not like this president is doing by ripping away the resources we need to actually solve this problem we cannot surrender our values and think that we re going to get border security we actually will lose security and our values we must fight for both applause crosstalk castro if i might if i might very briefly and this is an important point you know my plan and i m glad to see that senator booker senator warren and governor inslee agree with me on this my plan also includes getting rid of section 1325 of the immigration and nationality act to go back to the way we used to treat this when somebody comes across the border not to criminalize desperation to treat that as a civil violation applause and here s why it s important we see all of this horrendous family separation they use that law section 1325 to justify under the law separating little children from their families unknown thank you unknown jose castro and so i want to challenge every single candidate on this stage to support the repeal of section 1325 applause diaz balart thirty seconds booker as my friend here said i agree with him on that issue but folks should understand that the separation of children from families doesn t just go on at our border it happens in our communities as ice are ripping away parents from their american children spouses and the like and are creating fear in cities all across this country where parents are afraid to even drop their kids off to school or go to work we must end those policies as well crosstalk de blasio we have to change the discussion about in this country diaz balart mayor de blasio because look at the bottom line here those tragic that tragic photo of those that parent that child and i m saying this as a father every american should feel that in their heart every american should say that is not america those are not our values but we have to get under the skin of why we have this crisis in our system because we re not being honest about the division that s been fomented in this country the way that american citizens have been told that immigrants somehow created their misery and their pain and their challenges for all the american citizens out there who feel you re falling behind or feel the american dream is not working for you the immigrants didn t do that to you applause the big corporations did that to you the 1 percent did that to you we need to be the party of working people and that includes a party of immigrants but first we have to tell working people in america who are hurting that we re going to be on their side every single time against those big corporations who created this mess to begin with and remind people we re all in this together if we don t change that debate that politics that s holding us back we won t get all these reforms people are talking about that s what we need to do as democrats diaz balart if i could i m sorry speaking in spanish what would you do congressman day one at the white house o rourke speaking in spanish we would not turn back valeria and her father oscar we would accept them into this country and follow our own asylum laws we would not build walls we would not put kids in cages in fact we would spare no expense to reunite the families that have been separated already crosstalk o rourke and we would not criminally prosecute any family who is fleeing violence and persecution crosstalk castro repeal of section 1325 o rourke we would make sure diaz balart secretary let him finish and i will give you crosstalk diaz balart but let him finish let him finish o rourke we would not detain any family fleeing violence in fact fleeing the deadliest countries on the face of the planet today we would implement a family case management program so they could be cared for in the community at a fraction of the cost and then we would rewrite our immigration laws in our own image free dreamers forever from any fear of deportation by making them u s citizens here in this country invest in solutions in central america work with regional stakeholders so there s no reason to make that 2 000 mile journey to this country diaz balart thank you crosstalk secretary i ll give you 30 seconds castro let s be very clear the reason that they re separating these little children from their families is that they re using section 1325 of that act which criminalizes coming across the border to incarcerate the parents and then separate them some of us on this stage have called to end that section to terminate it some like congressman o rourke have not and i want to challenge all of the candidate to do that applause crosstalk castro i just think it s a mistake beto i think it s a mistake and i think that that if you truly want to change the system that we ve got to repeal that section if not diaz balart thank you crosstalk castro then it might as well be the same policy o rourke let me respond to this very briefly as a member of a congress i helped to introduce legislation that would ensure that we don t criminalize those who are seeking asylum and refuge in this country castro i m not talking about i m not talking about the ones that are seeking asylum o rourke if you re fleeing if you re fleeing desperation then i want to make sure castro i m talking about i m talking about everybody else o rourke i want to make sure you are treated with respect castro i m still talking about everybody else o rourke but you re looking at just one small part of this i m talking about a comprehensive rewrite of our immigration laws castro that s not true applause o rourke and if you do that i don t think it s asking too much for people to follow our laws when they come to this country castro that s actually not true i m talking about millions of folks a lot of folks that are coming are not seeking asylum a lot of them are undocumented immigrants right and you said recently that the reason you didn t want to repeal section 1325 was because you were concerned about human trafficking and drug trafficking but let me tell you what section 18 title 18 of the u s code title 21 and title 22 already cover human trafficking crosstalk castro i think that you should do your homework on this issue if you did your homework on this issue you would know that we should repeal this section crosstalk diaz balart this is an issue that we should and could be talking about for a long time and we will for a long time delaney can we talk about the conditions about why people are coming here diaz balart let s lester lester i m sorry savannah i know it s just we could go on delaney but rather than talk about specific provisions we really have to talk about why these people are coming to our country guthrie you ll get your chance delaney and what we re going to do to actually make a difference in these countries guthrie congressman you ll get your chance let s continue the discussion senator klobuchar klobuchar yes guthrie let s talk about what secretary castro just said he wants to no longer have it be a crime to illegally cross the border do you support that do you think it should be a civil offense only and if so do you worry about potentially incentivizing people to come here klobuchar immigrants they do not diminish america they are america and i am happy to look at his proposal but i do think you want to make sure that you have provisions in place that allow you to go after traffickers and allow you to go after people who are violating the law what i really think we need to step back and talk about is the economic imperative here and that is that 70 of our fortune 500 companies are headed by people that came from other countries twenty five percent of our u s nobel laureates were born in other countries we have a situation right now where we need workers in our fields and in our factories we need them to start small businesses we need their ideas and this president has literally gone backwards at a time when our economy needs immigrants and so my proposal is to look at that 2013 bill that passed the senate with republican support to upgrade that bill to make it as good as possible and get it done it brings the doubt down by 158 billion guthrie senator klobuchar it gives a path for citizenship for citizen for people who can become citizens and it will be so much better for our economy in america guthrie senator that s time thank you applause congressman ryan same question should it be a crime to illegally cross the border or should it be a civil offense only ryan well i agree with secretary castro i think there are other provisions in the law that will allow you to prosecute people for coming over here if they re dealing drugs and other things that s already established in the law so there s no need to repeat it and i think it s abhorrent we re talking about this father who got killed with his daughter and the issues here the way these kids are being treated if you go to guantanamo bay there are terrorists that are held that get better health care than those kids that have tried to cross the border in the united states that needs to stop and i think the president should immediately ask doctors and nurses to go immediately down to the border and start taking care of these kids what kind of country are we running here where we have a president of the united states who s so focused on hate and fear and division and what has happened now the end result is now we ve got kids literally laying in their own snot with three week old diapers that haven t been changed we ve got to tell this president that is not a sign of strength mr president that is a sign of weakness crosstalk applause guthrie senator booker a lot of people they asked the question if you re president on day one what will you do with the fact that you will have families here there s been a lot of talk about what you ll do in the first 100 days about legislation what will you actually do with these families how will you care for them will they be detained or will they not be booker well this is a related and brief point because what we re talking what secretary castro and i are talking about is that we have the power to better deal with this problem through the civil process than the criminal process i have been to some of the largest private prisons which are repugnant to me that people are profiting off incarceration and their immigration lockups our country has made so many mistakes by criminalizing things whether it s immigration whether it s mental illness whether it s addiction we know that this is not the way to deal with problems there is a humane way that affirms human rights and human dignity and actually solves this problem donald trump isn t solving this problem we ve seen under his leadership a surge at our border we solve this problem by making investments in the northern triangle to stop the reasons why people are being driven here in the first place and we make sure we use our resources to provide health care to affirm the values and human dignity of the people that come here because we cannot sacrifice our values our ideals as a nation for border security we can have both by doing this the right way applause guthrie all right senator thank you let me go to governor inslee on this what would you do on day one same question i just asked cory booker i have yet to hear an answer from anyone on this stage inslee there is no reason crosstalk guthrie what will you do with the families that will be here inslee there is no reason for the detention and separation of these children they should be released pending their hearings and they should have a hearing and the law should be followed that s what should happen and we should do what we re doing in washington state i m proud that we ve passed a law that prevents local law enforcement from being turned into mini ice agents i m proud to have been the first governor to stand up against donald trump s heinous muslim ban i m proud to be a person who s not only talked about dreamers but being one of the first to make sure that they get a college education so that they can realize their dreams these are some of the most inspirational people in our state and i ll leave you with this thought if you want to know what i think donald trump the other day tried to threaten me he thought it was a threat to tell me that he would send refugees into washington state if we passed a law that i passed and i told him that s not a threat at all we welcome refugees into our state we recognize diversity as a strength this is how we ve built america that tradition is going to continue if i m president of the united states applause crosstalk holt we re going to switch to another topic now we ve got a lot to get to let s crosstalk delaney my grandfather was actually separated from his family when he came to this country holt we re going to we re going to talk about iran right now because we re working against the clock tankers have been attacked a u s drone has been shot down there have been disturbing threats issued by both the u s and iranian leadership i d like if you can just for a moment to put aside how you think we may have gotten here but what i want to know is how do you dial it back so a show of hands who as president would sign on to the 2015 nuclear deal as it was originally negotiated that s every well senator booker why not applause booker may i address that first and foremost it was a mistake to pull out of that deal and one of the reasons why we re seeing this hostility now is because donald trump is marching us to a far more dangerous situation literally he took us out of a deal that gave us transparency into their nuclear program and pushed back a nuclear breakout 10 20 years and now we see iran threatening to go further and who are pulled being pulled further and further into this crisis we need to renegotiate and get back into a deal but i m not going to have a primary platform to say unilaterally i m going to rejoin that deal because when i m president of the united states i m going to do the best i can to secure this country and that region and make sure that if i have an opportunity to leverage a better deal i m going to do it crosstalk holt all right senator klobuchar i d like to ask you to answer that question because you ve said you ve said you would negotiate yourself back into the iranian agreement can you argue that that nuclear pact as it was ratified was a good deal unknown yes it was klobuchar it was imperfect but it was a good deal for that moment i would have worked to get longer sunset periods and that s something we could negotiate to get back in the deal but the point is donald trump told us when he got out of it that he was going to give us a better deal those were his words and now we are a month away from the iranians who claim now that they re going blow the caps on enriching uranium and the iranians have told us this and so that s where we are now he has made us less safe than we were when he became president so what i would do is negotiate us back into that agreement is stand with our allies and not give unlimited leverage to china and russia which is what he has done and then finally i would make sure that if there is any possibility of a conflict and we re having this debate in congress right now that he comes to congress for an authorization of military force i would do that applause and this president is literally every single day 10 minutes away from going to war one tweet away from going to war and i don t think we should conduct holt all right your time is up klobuchar foreign policy in our bathrobe at 5 00 in the morning which is what he does applause holt congresswoman gabbard congresswoman gabbard you ve said you would sign back on to the 2015 deal would you would you insist though that it address iran s support for hezbollah gabbard let s deal with the situation where we are where this president and his chickenhawk cabinet have led us to the brink of war with iran i served in the war in iraq at the height of the war in 2005 a war that took over 4 000 of my brothers and sisters in uniforms lives the american people need to understand that this war with iran would be far more devastating far more costly than anything that we ever saw in iraq it would take many more lives it would exacerbate the refugee crisis and it wouldn t be just contained within iran this would turn into a regional war this is why it s so important that every one of us every single american stand up and say no war with iran we need to get back into the iran nuclear agreement and we need to negotiate how we can improve it applause it was an imperfect deal there are issues like their missile development that needs to be addressed we can do both simultaneously to prevent iran from developing a nuclear weapon and preventing us from going to war holt your time is up and this is a very quick follow up but what would your red line be that would for military action against iran gabbard look obviously if there was an attack against the american our troops then there would have to be a response but my point is and it s important for us to recognize this is donald trump and his cabinet mike pompeo john bolton and others are creating a situation that just a spark would light off a war with iran which is incredibly dangerous that s why we need to de escalate tensions trump needs to get back into the iran nuclear deal and swallow his pride put the american people first applause de blasio hey but wait a minute crosstalk guthrie we will have much more mayor de blasio we ll have more the commercial is coming when we ll continue our questioning next with chuck todd rachel maddow stick around we ll have a lot more with some very anxious candidates just ahead commercial break holt and welcome back everyone to the first democratic presidential debate from the arsht center in miami guthrie and as we continue the questioning time to get more members of our team in the mix diaz balart so right now let s turn it over to chuck todd and rachel maddow take it away applause maddow all right we re going to start by recapping the rules twenty candidates qualified for this first democratic debate we re going to hear from 10 tonight 10 more tomorrow the breakdown for each night was selected at random now the candidates will have 60 seconds to answer 30 seconds for a follow up if necessary and we will be ruthless if necessary todd we can do that laughter by the way hi rachel maddow hi chuck todd how are you doing maddow good todd and we ve got a lot of ground to cover we re going to be talking about guns and climate here up top a whole lot more in this hour obviously because of the size of the field not every person will be able to weigh in on everything but over the course of this next hour we will hear from everyone i promise everybody todd and to begin with we re going to go with guns and senator warren i want to start with you we are less than 50 miles from parkland florida where 17 people were killed in a school shooting last year and where there has been significant activism on gun violence ever since many of you are calling for a restoration of an assault weapons ban but even if implemented there will still be hundreds of millions of guns in this country should there be a role for the federal government unknown their mikes are on todd everybody s mikes are on i think we have a i heard that too that s ok i think we had a little mike issue in the back maddow control room we ve got crosstalk todd we had the i think we heard yeah we have the audience audio all right so the question is simply this we re from i apologize you guys didn t get to hear this the first part of the question obviously we re not far from parkland florida gun activism has become a big part of high school life up there in broward county many of you are calling for tighter gun restrictions some of you are calling for the restoration of the assault weapons ban but even if it s put in place there are still going to be perhaps hundreds of millions of guns still on the streets is there a role for the federal government in order to to play in order to get these guns off the streets crosstalk maddow what s happening todd we are hearing our colleague s audio if the control room could turn off the mikes laughter crosstalk todd yeah if the control room could turn off the mikes of our previous moderators we will maddow you know we ve prepared for everything todd guess what guys we are going to take a quick break we re going to get this technical situation fixed we will be right back commercial break todd we believe we have the technical difficulties fixed maddow never say that todd never say never but we will march forward here and i will lean forward here a little bit senator warren we re going to get to the gun question here in parkland florida it s just north of here in broward county as you know it has created a lot of teenage activism on the gun issue it has inspired a lot of you to come out with more robust plans to deal with guns including assault weapons ban but even if you re able to implement that what do you do about the hundreds of millions of guns already out there and does the federal government have to play a role in dealing with it warren so in this period of time that i have been running for president i ve had more than 100 town halls i ve taken more than 2 000 unfiltered questions and the single hardest questions i ve gotten i got one from a little boy and i got one from a little girl and that is to say when you re president how are you going to keep us safe that s our responsibility as adults seven children will die today from gun violence children and teenagers and they won t just die in mass shootings they ll die on sidewalks they ll die in playgrounds they ll die in people s backyards gun violence is a national health emergency in this country and we need to treat it like that applause so what can we do we can do the things that are sensible we can do the universal background checks we can ban the weapons of war but we can also double down on the research and find out what really works where it is that we can make the differences at the margins that will keep our children safe we need to treat this like the virus that s killing our children todd ok thank you senator warren you didn t address do you think the federal government needs to go and figure out a way to get the guns that are already out there warren what i think we need to do is we need to treat it like a serious research problem which we have not done you know guns in the hands of a collector who s had them for decades who s never fired them who takes safety seriously that s very different from guns that are sold and turned over quickly we can t treat this as an across the board problem we have to treat it like a public health emergency that means bring data to bear and it means make real change in this country whether it s politically popular or not todd thank you senator senator booker you have a program warren we need to fight for our children applause todd senator booker you have a federal government buyback program in your plan how is that going to work booker well first of all i want to say my colleague and i both have been hearing this on the campaign trail but what s even worse is i hear gunshots in my neighborhood i think i m the only one i hope i m the only one on this panel here that had seven people shot in their neighborhood just last week someone i knew shahad smith was killed with an assault rifle at the top of my block last year for millions of americans this is not a policy issue this is an urgency and for those that have not been directly affected they re tired of living in country where their kids go to school to learn about reading writing and arithmetic and how to deal with an active shooter in their school this is something that i m tired of and i m tired of hearing people all they have to offer is thoughts and prayers applause in my faith people say faith without works is dead so we will find a way but the reason we have a problem right now is we ve let the corporate gun lobby frame this debate it is time that we have bold actions and a bold agenda i will get that done as president of the united states because this is not about policy this is personal todd thank you senator booker maddow secretary castro i d like to talk to you about something that senator booker just mentioned there the idea of active shooter drills in schools as school shootings seem like an almost everyday or every week occurrence now they don t make a complete news cycle anymore no matter the death toll as parents are so afraid as their kids go off to school that their kids will be caught up in something like this next to nothing has changed in federal law that might affect the prevalence of school shootings is this a problem that is going to continue to get worse over our lifetimes or is there something that you would do as president that you really think would turn it around castro you know rachel i am the dad of a 10 year old girl carina who s here tonight and the worst thing is knowing that your child might be worried about what could happen at school a place that s supposed to be safe the answer to your question is no we don t have to accept that and i believe that on january 20 2021 at 12 01 p m we re going to have a democratic president a democratic house and a democratic senate applause and the activists of parkland folks from moms demand who have risen up across the united states and inspired so many people applause you know we may not have seen yet legislative action but we re getting closer the house took a vote in the senate the question often is if the decision is between 60 votes a filibuster or passing commonsense gun reform i m going to choose commonsense gun reform so i believe that we re going to be able to get that done in 2021 todd secretary castro thank you ryan rachel i have something to add to this briefly because maddow we ll give you it ll be 30 seconds for a follow up on that question on that answer from secretary castro congressman ryan ryan you re talking about in the schools these kids are traumatized i support all the gun reforms here we need to start dealing with the trauma that our kids have we need trauma based care in every school we need social and emotional learning in every school ninety percent of the shooters who do school shootings come from the school they re in and 73 percent of them feel shamed traumatized or bullied we need to make sure that these kids feel connected to the school that means a mental health counselor in every single school in the united states we need to start playing offense if our kids are so traumatized that they re getting a gun and going into our schools we re doing something wrong too and we need reform around trauma based care maddow thank you congressman ryan todd congressman o rourke you re a texan who s campaigned you campaigned all over the state in 2018 in the most conservative parts there what do you tell a gun owner who may agree with you on everything else ok but says you know what the democrats if i vote for them in there they re going to take my gun away and even though i agree with you on all these other issues how do you have that conversation o rourke here s how we have that conversation in texas i shared with them what i learned from those students who survived the santa fe high school shooting a young student named bree her friend marcel who survived another shooting the mother of a victim who lost her life rhonda hart they talked about universal background checks where you close every loophole we know that they save lives we talked about ending the sales of assault weapons into our communities those weapons of war were designed to kill people as effectively and as efficiently as possible they should belong on the battlefield and not in our communities applause red flag laws so if someone poses a danger to themselves or to someone else they re stopped before it s too late and what i found in each one of those 254 counties is that democrats and independents and republicans gun owners and non gun owners alike agreed but this effort must be led by the young people that you referenced at the beginning of this issue those students from marjory stoneman douglas led the charge here in florida and they ve been able to change those laws they re making our democracy work ensuring that our values and our interests and our priorities are reflected in the laws that we pass crosstalk todd thank you congressman o rourke crosstalk hang on let me give 30 seconds senator klobuchar the iron range i m curious gun confiscation right if the government is buying back how do you not have that conversation klobuchar well that s not confiscation you could give them the offer to buy back their gun but i ll say this i look at these proposals and i say does this hurt my uncle dick and his deer stand coming from a proud hunting and fishing state these proposals don t do that when i was a prosecutor i supported the assault weapons ban when i was in the senate i saw those moms from sandy hook come and try to advocate for change and we all failed and then now these parkland kids from florida they started literally a national shift you know why it s just like with gay marriage when kids talked to their parents and their grandparents they say i don t understand why we can t put these sensible things in place they listen and if we get bested by a bunch of 17 year olds todd all right senator thank you klobuchar it s the best thing that ever happened we need to get crosstalk todd senator thank you senator thank you maddow senator booker let me go to you on another matter actually todd we ve got to maddow senator mitch mcconnell says that his most consequential achievement as senate majority leader was preventing president obama from filling a supreme court seat having served with republicans on the judiciary committee do you believe they would confirm your court nominees booker i m going to use 20 of my seconds just to say there s one thing we don t all agree with when it comes to guns and i think it s common sense and over 70 percent of americans agree with me if you need a license to drive a car you should need a license to buy and own a firearm applause and not everybody in this field agrees with that but in states like connecticut that did that they saw 40 percent drops in gun violence and 15 percent drops in suicides we need to start having bold agendas on guns when it comes to the supreme court very clearly we i agree with my friend secretary castro we are going to get to 50 votes in the senate this is a team sport whoever is our nominee needs to campaign in places like south carolina because we can elect jamie harrison they need to campaign in places like iowa because we can win a senate seat there this is about getting us back to having 50 votes in the senate and more so that we cannot only balance the supreme court but start to pass an aggressive agenda that frankly isn t so aggressive because most of america agrees with the policy objectives of our party applause maddow mayor de blasio crosstalk delaney rachel we have to actually maddow congressman delaney you ll have some time in a moment on this issue crosstalk delaney this issue is related crosstalk maddow congressman delaney i ll give you some time in a moment mayor de blasio as an executive in the largest city in this country you are used to saying what you want to have happen and having it happen if you nominate a supreme court nominee as president of the united states and mitch mcconnell is still senate majority leader what makes you believe that he would allow you to make a nominee de blasio rachel i am chief executive of the nation s largest city and i also wanted to just say something quick on the gun issue and come to your question look i run the largest police force in america too and if we re going to stop these shootings we want to get these guns off the street we have to have a very different relationship between our police and our community applause i also want to say there s something that sets me apart from all my colleagues running in this race and that is for the last 21 years i have been raising a black son in america and i have had to have very very serious talks with my son dante about how to protect himself on the streets of our city and all over this country including how to deal with the fact that he has to take special caution because there have been too many tragedies between our young men and our police too as we saw recently in indiana so we need to have a different conversation in this country about guns but also a different conversation about policing that brings policing community together we ve done that in new york city and we ve driven down crime while we ve done it but to your question about mitch mcconnell there is a political solution that we have to come to grips with if the democratic party would stop acting like the party of the elites and be the party of working people again and go into states including red states to convince people we re on their side we can put pressure on their senators to actually have to vote for the nominees that are put forward crosstalk maddow that s time crosstalk todd senator warren i m going to get you i will get you 30 seconds i promise let me get let me get this question we re trying i know you guys we ve got other issues we re trying to get to including a big one coming up in a minute but senator warren i want to continue on the mitch mcconnell thing because you have a lot of ambitious plans warren i do todd you have a plan for that ok we talked about the supreme court do you have a plan to deal with mitch mcconnell if you don t beat him in the senate if he s still sitting there as the senate majority leader it s very plausible you be elected president with a republican senate do you have a plan to deal with mitch mcconnell warren i do applause we are democracy and the way a democracy is supposed to work is the will of the people matters now we have for far too long have had a congress in washington that has just completely dismissed what people care about across this country they have made this country work much better than for those who can make giant contributions made it work better for those who hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers and not made it work for the people well here s how i see this happening number one sure i want to see us get a democratic majority in the senate but short of a democratic majority in the senate you better understand the fight still goes on it starts in the white house and it means that everybody we energize in 2020 stays on the frontlines come january 2021 we have to push from the outside have leadership from the inside and make this congress reflect the will of the people todd i m going to get to i m going to get a couple of you in here applause i m going to get a couple of you in here thirty seconds congressman delaney you seem to believe you can do everything in a bipartisan manner mitch mcconnell doesn t operate that way he operates differently why do you think he is going to conform to your style delaney i think we need to get things done that s why i believe we need to operate in a bipartisan manner listen i will sign into law bills that come to the white house that are passed on a party line basis absolutely but all the big transformative things we ve ever done in this country s history have happened when huge majorities of the american people get behind them which is why we need real solutions not impossible promises we need to put forth ideas that work whether it s on health care creating universal health care so that every american gets health care but not running on making private insurance illegal the gun issue is related the gun safety issue is related because i can t tell you how many times i ve been with folks in western maryland and they ve said to me you know democrats don t do anything for us republicans don t do anything for us you fight all the time so they vote on that single issue todd ok crosstalk delaney if we become the party of getting things done for the american people with real solutions and not impossible promises we ll be able to get all these things done crosstalk todd i promised crosstalk todd senator booker 30 seconds you how do you deal with mitch you ve been in the senate you can t get bills on the floor right now with mitch mcconnell presidents can t do it is president booker going to get his bills on the floor with senator mcconnell booker you know when i got to the united states senate going back to what de blasio said as an african american man in an african american dominated community i knew one of the biggest issue was criminal justice reform from police accountability to dealing with the fact that we have a nation that has more african americans under criminal supervision than all the slaves in 1850 and when i got to the senate people told me we could not get a comprehensive criminal justice reform bill done as my colleagues in the senate know i fought on that bill from the day i got to the senate built coalitions across the aisle and today we passed the first step act applause it s not as far as i want to go but thousands of people will be liberated i have gotten i have taken on tough problems people said we cannot achieve and i ve been able to get things accomplished todd thank you senator booker rachel has got the next question crosstalk maddow we are going to hold on governor you re going to be happy with where we go todd just give us a second maddow governor inslee the next question is to you you got me inslee rachel laughter maddow you have staked your candidacy on the issue of climate change it is first second and third priority for you you ve said it s all the issues let s get specific we re here in miami which is already experiencing serious flooding on sunny days as a result of sea level rise parts of miami beach and the keys could be underwater in our lifetimes does your plan save miami inslee yes first by taking away the filibuster from mitch mcconnell to start with we have to do that applause look it look it we are the first generation to feel the sting of climate change and we are the last that can do something it our towns are burning our fields are flooding miami is inundated and we have to understand this is a climate crisis an emergency off mike this is our last chance in the administration next one to do something about it and we need to do what i ve done in my state we ve passed a 100 percent clean electrical grid bill we now have a vision statement and my plan has been called the gold standard of putting people to work but the most important thing on this in the biggest decision for the american public is who is going to make this the first priority and i am the candidate and the only one who s saying this has to be the top priority of the united states the organizing principle to mobilize the united states so that we can do what we ve always done lead the world and invent the future and put 8 million people to work that s what we re going to do maddow governor inslee thank you applause todd congressman o rourke you also put out a big climate change plan from your campaign you want some big changes in a pretty short period of time including switching to renewable energy pushing to replace gas powered cars in favor of electric ones what s your message to a voter who supports the overall goal of what you re trying to do but suddenly feels as if government s telling them how to live and ordering them how to live what is that balance like o rourke i think you ve got to bring everybody in to the decisions and the solutions to the challenges that we face that s why we re traveling everywhere listening to everyone we were in pacific junction a town that had never meaningly flooded before just up against the missouri river in iowa and every home in that community had flooded there were farms just outside of pacific junction that were effectively lakes those farmers already underwater in debt their markets closed to them by a trade war under this administration and now they don t know what to do we in our administration are going fund resiliency in those communities in miami in houston texas those places that are on the front lines of climate change today we re going to mobilize 5 trillion in this economy over the next 10 years we re going to free ourselves from a dependence on fossil fuels and we re going to put farmers and ranchers in the driver s seat renewable and sustainable agriculture to make sure that we capture more carbon out of the air and keep more of it in the soil paying farmers for the environmental services that they want to provide if all of us does all that we can then we re going to be able to keep this planet from warming another 2 degrees celsius and ensure that we match what this country can do and live up to our promise and our potential todd thirty seconds secretary castro does who pays for the mitigation to to climate whether it s building sea walls for people that are perhaps living in places that they shouldn t be living is this a federal government issue that needs to do that do they have to move these people what do you do about that where maybe they re building a place someplace that isn t safe who pays to build that house and how much should the government be bailing them out castro well i don t think that that represents the vast majority of the issue in fact you know my first visit after i announced my candidacy wasn t to iowa or new hampshire it was to san juan puerto rico applause because people should know that if i m elected president everybody will count and you know i m one of the few candidates in this race with executive experience with a track record of getting things done when i was mayor of san antonio we moved our local public utility we began to shift it from coal fired plants to solar and other renewables and also created more than 800 jobs doing that and when i was hud secretary we worked on the national disaster resilience competition to invest in communities that were trying to rebuild from natural disasters in a sustainable way that s the way that we re going to help make sure that we re all safer in the years to come and that we combat climate change todd thank you castro and if i m elected president the first thing that i would do like senator klobuchar also has said is sign an executive order recommitting us to the paris climate accord so that we lead again crosstalk todd all right congressman ryan i got a full question for you here which is simply this there are a lot of the climate plans include pricing carbon taxing carbon in some way this type of proposal has been tried in a few places whether it s washington state where voters voted it down you ve had the yellow vest movement we had in australia one party get rejected out of fear of the cost of climate change sort of being put on the backs of the consumer if pricing carbon is just politically impossible how do we pay for climate mitigation ryan well there is a variety of different ways to pay we talked about different ways of raising revenue and i think we ve got to build our way out of this and grow our way out of this but let me just talk real quick to the previous question about real politics we could talk about climate we could talk about guns we could talk about all of these issues that we all care about we have a perception problem with the democratic party we are not connecting to the working class people in the very states that i represent in ohio in the industrial midwest we ve lost all connection we have got to change the center of gravity of the democratic party from being coastal and elital elitist and ivy league which is the perception to somebody from the forgotten communities that have been left behind for the last 30 years to get those workers back on our side so we can say we re going to build electric vehicles we re going to build solar panels but if you want to beat mitch mcconnell this better be a working class party if you want to go into kentucky and take his rear end out and if you want to take lindsey graham out you ve got to have a blue collar party that can go into the textile communities in south carolina so all i m saying here crosstalk todd thank you congressman ryan ryan all i m saying here todd thank you congressman ryan castro so chuck chuck crosstalk ryan all i m saying is here if we don t address that fundamental prob with our connection to workers white black brown gay straight working class people todd thank you congressman ryan none of this is going to get done chuck todd thank you very much unknown chuck crosstalk todd i want to you we re going to keep moving congressman delaney i m going to get to you delaney this is i introduced the only bipartisan carbon tax bill todd thirty seconds all right 30 seconds go crosstalk delaney this is really important all the economists agree that a carbon pricing mechanism works you just have to do it right you can t put a price on carbon raise energy prices and not give the money back to the american people my proposal which is put a price on carbon give a dividend back to the american people it goes out one pocket back in the other todd thank you congressman delaney i can get that passed my first year as president with a coalition of every democrat in the congress and the republicans who live in coastal states todd thank you congressman thank you delaney because republicans in florida they actually care about this issue todd ok thank you very much delaney this has got to be our way forward if we re actually serious about this issue applause todd thank you congresswoman gabbard we re going to move here one of the first things you did after launching your campaign was to issue an apology to the lgbt community about your past stances and statements on gay rights after the trump administration s rollbacks of civil rights protections for many in that community why should voters in that community or voters that care about this issue in general trust you now gabbard let me say that there is no one in our government at any level who has the right to tell any american who they should be allowed to love or who they should be allowed to marry applause my record in congress for over six years shows my commitment to fighting for lgbtq equality i serve on the equality caucus and recently voted for passage of the equality act maybe many people in this country can relate to the fact that i grew up in a socially conservative home held views when i was very young that i no longer hold today i ve served with lgbtq service members both in training and deployed downrange i know that they would give their life for me and i would give my life for them it is this commitment that i ll carry through as president of the united states recognizing that there are still people who are facing discrimination in the workplace still people who are unable to find a home for their families it is this kind of discrimination that we need to address booker but it s not enough todd thank you congresswoman gabbard booker it s not enough if i can add to this it s very important todd thirty seconds senator booker it s not enough look civil rights is someplace to begin but in the african american civil rights community another place to focus on was to stop the lynching of african americans we do not talk enough about trans americans especially african american trans americans applause and the incredibly high rates of murder right now we don t talk enough about how many children about 30 percent of lgbtq kids who do not go to school because of fear it s not enough just to be on the equality act i m an original co sponsor we need to have a president that will fight to protect lgbtq americans every single day from violence in america crosstalk maddow senator klobuchar let me put this to you on the issue of civil rights for decades on the civil rights and demographics honestly and politics for decades the democratic party has counted on african american voter turnout as step one to winning elections on a national level democrats are counting on the latino community now and in the future in the same way what have you done for black and latino voters that should enthuse them about going to the polls for you if you re your party s nominee klobuchar my life and my career and my work in the senate has been about economic opportunity and to me this means better childcare for everyone in this country and when you want an economy that works you need to have retirement that works you need to have public schools that work and you also need to make sure that those communities are able to get those jobs of the future the stem jobs in fact donald trump one of the first bills that he signed of the 34 he signed where i was the lead democrat ok that s a first up here was one that was about that making sure minority community members could share in those jobs so to me this is about a few things it s about an african american woman that goes to a hospital in new orleans says her hands are swollen and then doctor ignores her and her baby dies it s about the fact that african american women make 61 cents for every dollar a white man makes so in short we need one and i will do this in my first 100 days as president we will work to make sure everyone can vote at this table everyone can vote in this country maddow that s time senator klobuchar and we will also go to the next step of criminal justice reform senator booker and i worked on that first step act but we should go to the second step act which is to help all our communities across our country maddow senator thank you very much thirty second follow up to you secretary castro this is a 70 percent latino city here in miami you are the only latino democrat who is running here this year in the presidential race applause is that enough of an answer what senator klobuchar is describing there an economic justice agenda is that enough to mobilize latino voters to stand with the democratic party in a big way castro well i also think that we have to recognize racial and social justice and you know i was in charleston not too long ago and i remembered that dylann roof went to the mother emanuel ame church and he murdered nine people who were worshipping and then he was apprehended by police without incident well but what about eric garner and tamir rice and laquan mcdonald and sandra bland and pamela turner and antonio arce i m proud that i m the only candidate so far that has put forward legislation that would reform our policing system in america and make sure that no matter what the color of your skin is that you re treated the same including latinos who are mistreated too oftentimes by police maddow secretary castro thank you todd let me go over to lester holt who s got a question i believe a viewer question holt and i m over here chuck thanks we asked voters from across the country to submit their questions to the candidates let me read one now this comes from john in new york who submitted this question he asks does the united states have a responsibility to protect in the case of genocide or crimes against humanity do we have a responsibility to intervene to protect people threatened by their governments even when atrocities do not affect american core interests i would like to direct that question to congressman o rourke o rourke john appreciate the question the answer is yes but that action should always be undertaken with allies and partners and friends when the united states presents a united front we have a much better chance of achieving our foreign policy aims and preventing the kind of genocide to which you refer the kind of genocide that we saw in rwanda the kind of genocide we want to stop going forward but unfortunately under this administration president trump has alienated our allies and our friends and our alliances he s diminished our standing in the world and he s made us weaker as a country less able to confront challenges whether it s iran or north korea or vladimir putin in russia who attacked and invaded our democracy in 2016 and who president trump has offered another invitation to do the same he s embraced strongmen and dictators at the expense of the great democracies as president i will make sure that we live our values in our foreign policy i will ensure that we strengthen those alliances and partnerships and friendships and meet any challenge that we face together that makes america stronger applause de blasio but what about the war powers act maddow congressman o rourke thank you de blasio what about the war powers act being a part of that equation with deep respect to the congressman look we ve learned painful lessons as americans that we ve gone to war without congressional authorization and look this is very personal for me i know the cost of war my dad served in the pacific in world war ii in the u s army battle of okinawa had half his leg blown off and he came home with scars both physical and emotional and he did not recover he spiraled downward and he ultimately took his own life and that battle didn t kill him but that war did and look even in the humanitarian crisis and i think we should be ready congressman to intervene god forbid there is genocide but not without congressional approval democrats and republicans both in the congress have not challenged presidents and have let them get away with running the military without that congressional approval we learned a lesson in vietnam we seem to have forgotten that decisions have to be made by the united states congress crosstalk maddow i m going to pick up i want to pick up this point and i want to put this to congressman ryan today the taliban claimed responsibility for killing two american service members in afghanistan leaders as disparate as president obama and president trump have both said that they want to end u s involvement in afghanistan but it isn t over for america why isn t it over why can t presidents of very different parties and very different temperaments get us out of there and how could you ryan i appreciate that question so i ve been in congress 17 years and 12 of those years i ve sat on the armed services committee the defense appropriations committee or the armed services committee and the lesson that i ve learned over the years is that you have to stay engaged in these situations nobody likes it it s long it s tedious but right now we have so i would say we must be engaged in this we must have our state department engaged we must have our military engaged to the extent they need to be but the reality of it is this president doesn t even have people appointed in the state department to deal with these things whether we re talking about central america whether we re talking about iran whether we re talking about afghanistan we ve got to be completely engaged and here s why because these flare ups distract us from the real problems in the country if we re getting drones shot down for 130 million because the president is distracted that s 130 million that we could be spending in places like youngstown ohio or flint michigan or rebuilding or rebuilding crosstalk maddow congresswoman gabbard i m going to give you 30 seconds actually to jump off what he said he described engagement as the problem gabbard is that what you will tell is that what you will tell the parents of those two soldiers who were just killed in afghanistan well we just have to be engaged as a soldier i will tell you that answer is unacceptable applause we have to bring our troops home from afghanistan we are in a place in afghanistan where we have lost so many lives we ve spent so much money money that s coming out of every one of our pockets money that should be going into communities here at home meeting the needs of the people here at home we are no better off in afghanistan today than we were when this war began this is why it s so important to have a president and commander in chief who knows the cost of war and who s ready to do the job on day one i am ready to do that job when i walk into the oval office applause crosstalk todd listen i m going to go down the line i m going to go down i m going to go down i m going to go down the line here you know what you felt you felt like she was rebutting you get 30 seconds go ryan thank you you re a very good man i appreciate that todd fair enough i hear what you re saying she invoked your name ryan i would just say i don t want to be engaged i wish we were spending this money in places that i ve represented that have been completely forgotten and we were rebuilding but the reality of it is if the united states isn t engaged the taliban will grow and they will have bigger bolder terrorist acts we have got to have some presence there crosstalk gabbard the taliban was there long before we came in they re going to be there long before we leave ryan and they were yeah exactly well we were gabbard we cannot keep u s troops deployed to afghanistan thinking that we re going to somehow squash this taliban that s been there that every other country that s tried has failed ryan i didn t say i didn t say squash them i didn t say squash them when we weren t in there they started flying planes into our buildings so i m just saying right now audience boos we have an obligation gabbard the taliban didn t attack us on 9 11 al qaida did ryan well i i understand gabbard al qaida attacked us on 9 11 that s why i and so many other people joined the military to go after al qaida not the taliban ryan i understand that the taliban crosstalk todd go ahead congressman finish up 10 seconds ryan the taliban was protecting those people who were plotting against us all i m saying is if we want to go into elections and we want to say that we ve got to withdraw from the world that s what president trump is saying we can t i would love for us to gabbard you know who s protecting al qaida right now it s saudi arabia todd i want to go down the line here finish up foreign policy it s a simple question what is our what is the biggest threat what is who is the geopolitical threat to the united states just give me a one word answer congressman delaney delaney could you repeat the question todd greatest geopolitical threat to the united states right now congressman delaney delaney well the biggest geopolitical challenge is china but the biggest geopolitical threat remains nuclear weapons todd ok delaney right so those are you know those are different questions todd i got you totally get it go ahead governor inslee inslee the biggest threat to the security of the united states is donald trump and there s no question about it applause todd congresswoman gabbard gabbard the greatest todd greatest geopolitical threat gabbard the greatest threat that we face is the fact that we re in a greater risk of nuclear war today than ever before in history todd senator klobuchar klobuchar two threats economic threat china but our major threat right now is what s going in the mideast with iran if we don t get crosstalk todd ok try to keep it at one slimmer than what we ve been going here one or two words o rourke our existential threat is climate change we have to confront it before it s too late todd senator warren inslee climate change todd yeah senator booker booker nuclear proliferation and climate change todd secretary castro castro china and climate change todd congressman ryan ryan china without a question they re wiping us around the world economically todd and mr mayor de blasio russia because they re trying to undermine our democracy and they ve been doing a pretty damn good job of it and we need to stop them todd all right well thank you for that wide variety of answers and i mean that no i mean that in that s what this debate is about this is the best part of a debate like this congressman o rourke special counsel robert mueller s report outlines multiple instances of potential criminal behavior by president trump house speaker pelosi has publicly and privately resisted any move toward impeachment in the house if the house chooses not to impeach as president would you do anything to address the potential c
toronto june 27 2019 globe newswire yamana gold inc tsx yri nyse auy yamana or the company today announced an increase to the three year guidance for its wholly owned jacobina mine and an update on its two phased plan to further increase production thereby improving the strategic life of mine the following tables present the company s increased production expectations for jacobina in 2019 2020 2021 and cost guidance for 2019 excluding further potential upside from the phase 2 expansion described below and any benefit from higher grade ore increases in production are only attributable to implementation of the phase 1 expansion which is now in progress 2018 actual 2019 guidance 2020 guidance 2021 guidance jacobina gold production oz 144 695 152 000 160 000 170 000 previous oz 145 000

890 refers to a non gaap financial measure or an additional line item or subtotal in financial statements reconciliations for all non gaap financial measures are available at www yamana com q12019 and in section 10 of the company s first quarter 2019 management s discussion analysis which has been filed on sedar mine site aisc all in sustaining costs includes cash costs mine site general and administrative expense sustaining capital capitalized exploration and expensed exploration consolidated aisc incorporates additional non mine site costs including corporate general and administrative expense yamana reports costs on a gold equivalent ounce basis jacobina produces only gold therefore in the case of jacobina gold equivalent ounces are equal to gold ounces the company is one year ahead of schedule in its plans to increase sustainable production to 150 000 ounces per year and now forecasts life of mine production of over 170 000 ounces per year after 2021 guidance for 2019 capital costs remains unchanged furthermore the company expects a similar level of total capital spending during 2020 all amounts are expressed in united states dollars unless otherwise indicated jacobina phase 1 update phase 1 involves a modest plant optimization to increase throughput to a sustainable level of 6 500 tonnes per day tpd by mid 2020 this optimization is ahead of schedule with quarter to date throughput averaging 6 182 tpd thereby allowing the company to increase its guidance this compares to average daily throughput of 5 580 tpd in 2018 optimization work completed to date includes improving grinding and crushing with the installation of an advanced process control system with monitoring devices for the mill and crushing circuit further initiatives to reduce plant maintenance downtime were completed in may remaining work for phase 1 is well advanced commissioning of a high frequency sieve and an induction furnace is expected in the third quarter and commissioning of two gravimetric concentrators and a cyclone battery to feed the thickener is expected by the first quarter of 2020 as of the end of june the remaining project capital costs to complete phase 1 are approximately 3 4 million approximately 2 million of these costs included in previously guided capital spending will be spent over the balance of 2019 with the remainder in 2020 phase 1 is expected to increase the gold production rate to approximately 170 000 ounces per year by 2021 at the current mineral reserves grade a 21 increase compared to original 2019 production guidance of 145 000 ounces per year following completion of the mill optimization there is potential for a further production increase driven by higher grades in 2019 exploration work has focused on supporting the planned expansion and targeting new mineral resources at a grade of 3 0 grams per tonne g t or better at year end 2018 proven and probable mineral reserves totaled 2 1 million ounces of gold contained in 27 9 million tonnes at an average grade of 2 34 g t measured and indicated mineral resources were 3 2 million ounces of gold contained in 40 7 million tonnes at 2 47 g t and inferred mineral resources totaled 1 0 million ounces contained in 12 1 million tonnes at 2 58 g t the mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates for jacobina at december 31 2018 are set out below updated mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates at jacobina are expected to be provided in the third quarter of 2019 the update will incorporate infill drilling of the higher grade inferred mineral resources at joão belo canavieiras sul morro do cuscuz and morro do vento assuming an increase in grade for the updated mineral reserves sustainable production resulting from phase 1 has the potential to exceed the 170 000 gold ounces per year production level while the updated guidance shows incremental production increases in the next three years resulting from the staged throughput increases as phase 1 is fully implemented the phase 1 expansion creates a sustainable production level of at least 170 000 gold ounces per year for the life of mine after the three year guidance period based on current mineral reserve grades which would further increase with grade improvements jacobina phase 2 update the phase 2 plant expansion is expected to result in a larger increase in plant capacity with a likely scenario in the range of 7 500 tpd to 8 500 tpd while maintaining gold recoveries of between 96 97 the higher throughput would gradually increase jacobina s gold production to at least 200 000 ounces per year and up to 225 000 ounces per year by 2023 based on current mineral reserve grades a pre feasibility study pfs to identify optimum mining and processing expansion scenarios evaluate project economics and determine a project development schedule including the timing for permit applications is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2020 investment for phase 2 is expected to occur mostly in 2021 and 2022 with the objective of being at the higher throughput level at the beginning of 2023 no expansionary capital will be committed to the plant expansion until the pfs is completed the company s hurdle requirement for expenditure on the phase 2 expansion is an after tax irr exceeding 15 the decision to proceed with the investment will be driven by the expansion of the plant throughput thus bringing forward cash flows but also an extension of mine life from continued exploration success and improvements to jacobina s average mineral reserve grade which would support the investment decision to this end the company has approved a 3 million increase to jacobina s exploration budget for the balance of 2019 and builds on the success from the 2018 program a dedicated exploration update for jacobina will be provided during the third quarter of 2019 jacobina has improved significantly in the last several years across all measures and it is now one of our higher quality high value operations said daniel racine president and chief executive officer of yamana we believe that it is on the cusp of becoming a world class mine particularly once a decision is made to proceed with the phase 2 expansion given strong production production growth increasing mineral inventory at improving grades and continuous increases in cash flow the planned expansion at jacobina is the continuation of a series of incremental improvements that have been successfully implemented over the past four years during which gold production increased from 75 000 ounces in 2014 to 145 000 ounces in 2018 the following table shows the incremental gold production growth trend that yamana is targeting with the phase 1 and phase 2 expansions these objectives are based on increase in throughput only and do not include further upside for an increase in grade as a result of exploration 2018 actual 2019 guidance 2020 guidance 2021 guidance 2022 objective 2023 objective jacobina

further geological potential and expectations will also be provided the company is also evaluating a paste backfill plan that will aim to reduce dilution and further improve production and costs an update is planned before the end of the year corporate overhead improvements yamana has been critically evaluating its general and administrative g a expenses to align its cost structure to its remaining portfolio of assets as the chapada sale is expected to be completed within the next few weeks the company now expects 2019 g a expenses on a cash basis to be lowered to 68 million compared with previous guidance of 75 million implying a run rate of approximately 60 million per year the company expects g a expenses to remain at 60 million in 2020 resulting in savings of over 15 million annually and the company anticipates that further reductions will be realized through optimizations and cost reduction initiatives these savings will be realized from the direct impact of the chapada sale and adjustments resulting from a smaller regional presence in brazil furthermore the company s overall organizational structure is being streamlined across south america in particular and over the entire organization more generally the anticipated saving from the g a initiatives that we are implementing align with the strategic rationale of the chapada sale racine said they will further

the canadian dollar is higher against the us dollar on wednesday the loonie rose slightly 0 38 percent versus the greenback with the price of oil also rising more than 2 percent the gold rally hit a speed bump with the yellow metal losing 0 41 percent as investors take profit on the current run and appetite for safe havens subsides the canadian currency traded h higher as treasury secretary stoked trade optimism by saying the deal is 90 percent done there is still little details on what that actually means and last time the market heard similar claims it was before a falling out that lead to tariff escalation from the us and china even if there is no major deal announcement the worst case scenarios are benign with a new round of talks the most likely outcome of the meeting as a sidebar of both leaders attending the g20 in japan the fed walked back market expectations of a 50 basis points cut with major dove fed president bullard suggesting a 25 basis points reduction would be more appropriate the fact remains that the fed could cut in the short term and that is boosting the loonie versus the greenback as economic data in canada validate the bank of canada boc staying on the sidelines by holding the benchmark rate at 1 75 percent and not follow other major central banks down the easing path just now oil crude higher after monster drawdown oil prices rose on wednesday after the release of the energy information administration eia weekly inventories report the higher than expected drawdown boosted crude prices with west texas intermediate rose 2 4 percent and brent 1 89 percent stronger demand in the us cause a 12 8 million drop in inventories destroying the 2 5 million forecast us production has been rising but at the moment the opec cut agreement us philadelphia energy solutions shutdown and geopolitical situations leading to sanctions against iran and venezuela are keeping supply levels low supply disruptions have added price stability in particular the production cut agreement by the opec but as doubts rise on what the fate of the g20 meetings will have on global growth and energy demand the deal could not get an extension it makes sense for major producers russia being the most vocal to delay their decision until they get a sense which way the us china trade war will unfold supply disruptions and lower inventories would push crude prices higher as middle east tensions remain high and with trade optimism at a level where at least trade relations could not get worse after a trump xi meeting gold gold rally stops as investors take profit eye g20 gold dropped 0 42 percent but given the strong safe haven rally the yellow metal is still trading above 1 409 42 middle eastern tensions will continue to remain high as iran and the us do not seem ready to back down and have in fact escalated their verbal attacks the g20 is looking to be a disappointment to investors looking for a blockbuster trade deal to be announced and is now expected to yield a new round of talks between the us and china to be held later this year the gold suffered another setback as two prominent fed members chair powell and fomc voting member and known dove bullard were less dovish than a week ago on tuesday a 50 basis point rate cut is off the table as per bullard next meeting but the sense that there is no urgency from the fed was not lost on the market us president trump was back on the offensive against the fed and he called the current monetary policy insane trump was disappointed that the fed did not cut rates in its june federal open market committee fomc meeting even though the fed has hinted at an upcoming rate cut the comments of 50 basis points being too much could end up with the central bank holding rates steady if economic indicators rebound in the short term today s data was mixed with core durable goods beating the forecast but the headline of new purchases by manufacturers going into negative territory for a second month in a row and with a downward revision to the previous data point stocks equities mixed on less dovish fed and g20 uncertainty equities continued to lose momentum on wednesday as middle eastern tensions trade anxiety and a less dovish fed did not combine to reassure investors the trump administration is trying to downplay expectations of a significant outcome of the upcoming meeting between presidents trump and xi in japan the two leaders will meet at a sidebar of their g20 commitments and given the huge distance in their negotiating positions there is now little probability of a major announcement on trade the fed chair and the most prominent dove in the fomc were less dovish than two weeks ago chair powell stressed the negative impact trade disputes have on economic growth but he continues to be hawkish on the american economy despite the latest indicators showing some softness powell remarked that even the tariffs have not put a lot of pressure the fed s chief main job at the moment is to manage the expectations of the market the g20 meeting is likely not to produce an agreement despite positive comments by us treasury secretary mnuchin but at least the two nations are back on the table powell could feel secure in calling current headwinds temporary awaiting a rebound of economic indicators such as gdp and the expected jobs rebound in the first week of july crypto bitcoin gets safe haven and libra boost bitcoin prices hit an 18 month high at it smashed the 13 000 price level and is trading at 13 619 on the back of facebook s entry into the crypto world the introduction of libra is validating the claim of bitcoin as an alternative asset class especially with current market conditions when investors seek to diversify to hedge

toronto june 27 2019 yamana gold inc tsx yri nyse auy yamana or the company today announced an increase to the three year guidance for its wholly owned jacobina mine and an update on its two phased plan to further increase production thereby improving the strategic life of mine the following tables present the company s increased production expectations for jacobina in 2019 2020 2021 and cost guidance for 2019 excluding further potential upside from the phase 2 expansion described below and any benefit from higher grade ore increases in production are only attributable to implementation of the phase 1 expansion which is now in progress 2018 actual 2019 guidance 2020 guidance 2021 guidance jacobina gold production oz 144 695 152 000 160 000 170 000 previous oz 145 000 total cost of sales

sustaining capital capitalized exploration and expensed exploration consolidated aisc incorporates additional non mine site costs including corporate general and administrative expense yamana reports costs on a gold equivalent ounce basis jacobina produces only gold therefore in the case of jacobina gold equivalent ounces are equal to gold ounces the company is one year ahead of schedule in its plans to increase sustainable production to 150 000 ounces per year and now forecasts life of mine production of over 170 000 ounces per year after 2021 guidance for 2019 capital costs remains unchanged furthermore the company expects a similar level of total capital spending during 2020 all amounts are expressed in united states dollars unless otherwise indicated jacobina phase 1 update phase 1 involves a modest plant optimization to increase throughput to a sustainable level of 6 500 tonnes per day tpd by mid 2020 this optimization is ahead of schedule with quarter to date throughput averaging 6 182 tpd thereby allowing the company to increase its guidance this compares to average daily throughput of 5 580 tpd in 2018 optimization work completed to date includes improving grinding and crushing with the installation of an advanced process control system with monitoring devices for the mill and crushing circuit further initiatives to reduce plant maintenance downtime were completed in may remaining work for phase 1 is well advanced commissioning of a high frequency sieve and an induction furnace is expected in the third quarter and commissioning of two gravimetric concentrators and a cyclone battery to feed the thickener is expected by the first quarter of 2020 as of the end of june the remaining project capital costs to complete phase 1 are approximately 3 4 million approximately 2 million of these costs included in previously guided capital spending will be spent over the balance of 2019 with the remainder in 2020 phase 1 is expected to increase the gold production rate to approximately 170 000 ounces per year by 2021 at the current mineral reserves grade a 21 increase compared to original 2019 production guidance of 145 000 ounces per year following completion of the mill optimization there is potential for a further production increase driven by higher grades in 2019 exploration work has focused on supporting the planned expansion and targeting new mineral resources ltd at a grade of 3 0 grams per tonne g t or better at year end 2018 proven and probable mineral reserves totaled 2 1 million ounces of gold contained in 27 9 million tonnes at an average grade of 2 34 g t measured and indicated mineral resources ltd were 3 2 million ounces of gold contained in 40 7 million tonnes at 2 47 g t and inferred mineral resources ltd totaled 1 0 million ounces contained in 12 1 million tonnes at 2 58 g t the mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates for jacobina at december 31 2018 are set out below updated mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates at jacobina are expected to be provided in the third quarter of 2019 the update will incorporate infill drilling of the higher grade inferred mineral resources ltd at joão belo canavieiras sul morro do cuscuz and morro do vento assuming an increase in grade for the updated mineral reserves sustainable production resulting from phase 1 has the potential to exceed the 170 000 gold ounces per year production level while the updated guidance shows incremental production increases in the next three years resulting from the staged throughput increases as phase 1 is fully implemented the phase 1 expansion creates a sustainable production level of at least 170 000 gold ounces per year for the life of mine after the three year guidance period based on current mineral reserve grades which would further increase with grade improvements jacobina phase 2 update the phase 2 plant expansion is expected to result in a larger increase in plant capacity with a likely scenario in the range of 7 500 tpd to 8 500 tpd while maintaining gold recoveries of between 96 97 the higher throughput would gradually increase jacobina s gold production to at least 200 000 ounces per year and up to 225 000 ounces per year by 2023 based on current mineral reserve grades a pre feasibility study pfs to identify optimum mining and processing expansion scenarios evaluate project economics and determine a project development schedule including the timing for permit applications is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2020 investment for phase 2 is expected to occur mostly in 2021 and 2022 with the objective of being at the higher throughput level at the beginning of 2023 no expansionary capital will be committed to the plant expansion until the pfs is completed the company s hurdle requirement for expenditure on the phase 2 expansion is an after tax irr exceeding 15 the decision to proceed with the investment will be driven by the expansion of the plant throughput thus bringing forward cash flows but also an extension of mine life from continued exploration success and improvements to jacobina s average mineral reserve grade which would support the investment decision to this end the company has approved a 3 million increase to jacobina s exploration budget for the balance of 2019 and builds on the success from the 2018 program a dedicated exploration update for jacobina will be provided during the third quarter of 2019 jacobina has improved significantly in the last several years across all measures and it is now one of our higher quality high value operations said daniel racine president and chief executive officer of yamana we believe that it is on the cusp of becoming a world class mine particularly once a decision is made to proceed with the phase 2 expansion given strong production production growth increasing mineral inventory at improving grades and continuous increases in cash flow the planned expansion at jacobina is the continuation of a series of incremental improvements that have been successfully implemented over the past four years during which gold production increased from 75 000 ounces in 2014 to 145 000 ounces in 2018 the following table shows the incremental gold production growth trend that yamana is targeting with the phase 1 and phase 2 expansions these objectives are based on increase in throughput only and do not include further upside for an increase in grade as a result of exploration 2018 actual 2019 guidance 2020 guidance 2021 guidance

that will aim to reduce dilution and further improve production and costs an update is planned before the end of the year corporate overhead improvements yamana has been critically evaluating its general and administrative g a expenses to align its cost structure to its remaining portfolio of assets as the chapada sale is expected to be completed within the next few weeks the company now expects 2019 g a expenses on a cash basis to be lowered to 68 million compared with previous guidance of 75 million implying a run rate of approximately 60 million per year the company expects g a expenses to remain at 60 million in 2020 resulting in savings of over 15 million annually and the company anticipates that further reductions will be realized through optimizations and cost reduction initiatives these savings will be realized from the direct impact of the chapada sale and adjustments resulting from a smaller regional presence in brazil furthermore the company s overall organizational structure is being streamlined across south america in particular and over the entire organization more generally the anticipated saving from the g a initiatives that we are implementing align with the strategic rationale of the chapada sale racine said they will further strengthen our balance sheet and improve our financial flexibility and they will simplify our organizational structure to match the company s remaining portfolio of five mines upcoming events the company would like to highlight a number of notable upcoming events and milestones these include the pre feasibility study for agua rica the completion of the chapada sale expected in early july following the closing of the chapada sale the repayment of the company s outstanding revolving credit

menafn caribbean news now by caribbean news now contributor port au prince haiti for over four months people in haiti have been protesting to demand that president jovenel moïse must resign amid allegations he embezzled hundreds of thousands of dollars of government funds designated for severely needed social programs according to a damaging report on government corruption given to the haitian senate by official auditors on may 31 has initiated recent protests with thousands marching through the capital port au prince and other cities throughout june on june 20 a committee from the organization of american states oas flew to haiti in hopes of lowering the political temperature petrocaribe a government program is at the centre of the 600 page report and demonstrators wrath under petrocaribe a vital oil alliance contracted with nearby venezuela in 2006 haiti the most impoverished nation in the americas saved valuable dollars by borrowing fuel from its oil rich neighbour and delaying payment for up to 25 years governments were deemed to use additional funds to strengthen the economy and finance social programs alternatively at least 2 billion equivalent to almost a quarter of haiti s entire economy for 2017 went unaccounted for and haitians saw few of the assured perks according to demonstrators and local reporters haitian taxpayers still owe venezuela billions of dollars for the borrowed oil the debacle has become a rallying cry for anti corruption protesters numerous of whom refer to themselves as petrochallengers here is what to know about petrocaribe and how it assisted in sparking haiti s demonstrations hugo chávez venezuela s former president created petrocaribe in 2005 venezuela has the world s biggest proven oil reserves the latin american country was producing around 2 5 million barrels of oil per day in the mid 2000s long before its current economic collapse chávez desired to transform those reserves into more important regional control and gain partners against the us in the organization of american states the petrocaribe program was effectively a means for the latin american country to provide other countries development loans but it loaned oil rather than cash venezuela s state oil business sold oil to haiti and 17 other caribbean countries and permitted them to delay payment on 40 percent of what they purchased for up to 25 years imposing an economical rate of interest for the debt recipient governments then sold that oil and utilised the profits to finance social programs with global oil costs at record levels in the initial years of the program the oil sales made a lot of money the program languished after venezuela s economy started to fall apart in 2014 as a dip in the oil cost exposed the consequences of years of mismanagement and corruption venezuela s oil production has fallen to 830 000 barrels per day and it ceased meeting its petrocaribe pledges to haiti in 2018 haiti is one of the most vulnerable members of the petrocaribe deal according to experts at the economist intelligence unit and it s now undergoing fuel deficits as a consequence of the program s deterioration in haiti the petrocaribe cash was precious especially following the 2010 earthquake that obliterated more than 200 000 people and pointed to a continuing cholera outbreak the government was deemed to utilise it to finance healthcare and infrastructure projects it claimed to have funded approximately 400 such projects using nearly 4 billion allocated by petrocaribe oil between 2008 and 2016 but a lack of visible results sparked doubt and in november 2017 a five member commission in the haitian senate reviewed the program and described evidence of widespread dishonesty in the management of the funds under three successive governments during that period the amount of capital in the government treasury was distorted exchange rates were changed and over half of the contracts awarded to businesses to sustain the projects didn t go through the normal government bid process according to the report because the money wasn t from a conventional international aid package analysts say there was little oversight of how governments used the profits and few restrictions on what they could do with it giving an abundant chance for corruption the disappeared money became a heated political embarrassment but the corruption did not initiate protest until after summer 2018 when inflation skyrocketed and government plans to increase fuel taxes prompted hostile demonstrations petrocaribe is partly a cypher for haiti s deep rooted and extensive corruption predicament haiti is listed 161 of 180 countries on watchdog group transparency international s annual corruption perceptions index and questions have also been asked about the disappearance of approximately 13 billion in international funding given to the country after its 2010 earthquake the world bank asserts corruption is a primary cause of haiti s unbelievable levels of poverty moïse was elected in february 2017 after the period the petrocaribe inquiries scrutinised but the report released may 31 the second phase of a three part investigation claims that he assisted in embezzling money from a large petrocaribe project before he came to office when he was head of the company agritrans agritrans was given approximately 700 000 to fix some roads even though its entire businesses were producing bananas on june 12 moïse refuted any wrongdoing and reemphasised that he would not resign notwithstanding the ongoing demonstrations

the two day g20 summit in the japanese city of osaka on friday the international community is calling for joint efforts by major economies to help maintain global growth as the world is increasingly threatened by protectionism in the name of protecting domestic industries the united states has slapped steep tariffs on billions of dollars worth of products from its partners heightening trade tensions worldwide and rocking the foundation of the multilateral trading system today uncertainty is not so much about integration but about disintegration multilateralism and free trade have come under pressure for example with international trade conflicts said burkhard balz a member of the executive board of deutsche bundesbank moving toward isolationism and unilateralism damages the g20

tackling the risks of global economic downturn although many g20 members have repeatedly called for coordination of economic policies over the past few years the bloc is still divided on certain thorny issues such as rising protectionism and climate change for example the g20 ministerial meeting earlier in june failed to include opposition to trade protectionism in the joint statement due to objections from the us side the us lost interest in cooperating in a multilateral format and actually stalled the process of reforming the system of global governance said yana leksyutina a professor

thralldom of deep debt corporate debt to fund stock buybacks while reporting record profits consumer debt student loan debt and of course government debt caused by drastic corporate and super rich tax cuts many trillions of dollars have been stolen from future generations the original doctrine of socialism meant government ownership of the means of production heavy industries railroads banks and the like nobody in national politics today is suggesting such a takeover as one quipster put it how can washington take ownership of the banks when the banks own washington confronting trump on the socialism taboo can open up a great debate about the value of government intervention for the good of the public sanders can effectively argue that people must choose either democratic socialism or the current failing system of corporate socialism that choice is not difficult such an american democratic socialism could provide almost all of the long overdue solutions this country needs full more efficient medicare for all tuition free education living wages stronger unions a tax system that works for the people investments in infrastructure and public works reforms for a massive runaway military budget the end of most corporate welfare government promotion of renewable energies and the end of subsidies for fossil fuels and nuclear power in my presidential campaigns i tried to make corporate socialism also called corporate welfare or crony capitalism a major issue small business is capitalism free to go bankrupt while corporate capitalism free to get bailouts from washington is really a form of corporate socialism this point about a corporate government was documented many years ago in books such as america inc 1971 by morton mintz and jerry cohen now it is even easier to make the case that our political economy is largely controlled by giant corporations and their political toadies today the concentration of power and wealth is staggering just six capitalist men have wealth to equal the wealth of half of the world s population the wall street collapse of 2008 2009 destroyed eight million jobs lost trillions of dollars in pension and mutual funds and pushed millions of families to lose their homes against this backdrop the u s government used trillions of taxpayer dollars to bail out in various ways the greedy financial giants whose reckless speculating caused the collapse in may 2009 the moderate senator from illinois dick durbin said the banks hard to believe when we re facing a banking crisis that many of the banks created are still the most powerful lobby on capitol hill and they frankly own the place is there a single federal government agency or department that can say its most powerful outside influence is not corporate even the labor department and the national labor relations board are under more corporate power than union power who better than trump on an anti socialist fantasy campaign kick can call attention to the reality that big business controls the government and by extension controls the people in september 2000 a business week poll found over 70 percent of people agreeing that big business has too much control over their lives this was before the horrific corporate crimes and scandals of the past two decades maybe that is why support in polls for socialism against capitalism in the u s is at a 60 year high people have long experienced american style socialism for example the publicly owned water and electric utilities public parks and forests the postal service public libraries fdic guarantees of bank deposits now up to 250 000 social security medicare and medicaid etc what the public is not sufficiently alert to is that big business has been profitably taking over control if not outright ownership of these public assets in the new book banking on the people by ellen brown readers can get an idea of the way large banks insurers and the giant shadow banking system money market funds hedge funds mortgage brokers and other unregulated financial intermediaries speculate and shift deep risk and their failures onto uncle sam these corporate predators gouge customers and remarkably show a deep aversion for productive investment as if people matter moreover they just keep developing new ever riskier multi tiered instruments eg derivatives to make money from money through evermore complex abstract secret reckless entangled globally destabilizing networks gambling with other people s money is a relentless wall street tradition the crashes that inevitably emerge end up impoverishing ordinary people who pay the price with their livelihoods will the democrats and other engaged people take trump on if he tries to make socialism the big scare in 2020 control of our political economy is not a conservative liberal or red state blue state issue when confronted with the specifics of the corporate state or corporate socialism people from all political persuasions will recognize the potential perils to our democracy no one wants to lose essential freedoms or to continue to pay the price of this runaway crony capitalism the gigantic corporations have been built with the thralldom of deep debt corporate debt to fund stock buybacks while reporting record profits consumer debt student loan debt and of course government debt caused by drastic corporate and super rich tax cuts many trillions of dollars have been stolen from future generations no wonder a small group of billionaires including george soros eli broad and nick hanauer have just publicly urged a modest tax on the super wealthy as hanauer a history buff and advocate of higher minimum wages says the pitchforks are coming
neal jennings reproduced under cc licensing aud 10 undervalued vs usd after 2018 2019 falls says cba fed hikes rba cuts and widening yield gap drive undervaluation but the mismatch between prices and value will be slow to correct aud usd to close half the gap by end 2020 gbp aud set to fall the australian dollar is undervalued by a double digit percentage although correcting the mismatch between market prices and the intrinsic value of the antipodean unit could be a long and drawn out process according to new analysis from commonwealth bank of australia australia s currency is down almost 1 against the u s dollar for 2019 and by 5 4 over the last 12 months leaving it trading just beneath the 0 70 handle on wednesday although its fair value is actually 0 79 but commonwealth one of australia s largest lenders forecasts it will only recover a fraction of this value over the next 18 months there are two main reasons aud usd is undervalued first because the australian current account deficit has narrowed to 0 6 of gdp compared to its thirty year average of 4 1 of gdp and second because the rba s commodity price index in us is at a five year high however the australian us 3 month interest rate spread is close to historical lows says kim mundy a strategist at cba in a note to clients wednesday the australian dollar has been dragged lower on the currency market by a range of factors in recent quarters even as higher commodity prices and a narrowing current account deficit have lifted its fundamental value above aud usd rate orange line left axis follows au u s yield spread lower from january 2018 federal reserve fed interest rate policy saw u s borrowing costs rise more than 1 in 2018 with rates increasing from 1 5 to 2 5 at a time when the reserve bank of australia rba cash rate remained steady at 1 5 that led yields on american government bonds to rise at a time when australian yields were falling as a result the gap between u s and australian yields which once favoured the aussie turned negative and began to favour of the u s currency in january 2018 movements in the above yield differentials or rate spreads are determined largely by relative central bank interest rate policies and have a significant influence over international capital flows as well as exchange rates capital flows tend to move in the direction of the most advantageous or improving returns with lower rates and yields normally driving investors out of and deterring them away from a currency rising rates and yields have the opposite effect the fed is now expected to cut its interest rate twice before year end but this might not necessarily bring relief to the aussie not least of all because the reserve bank of australia has already cut its interest rate this month to a new record low of 1 25 and financial markets are convinced that even further cuts are on the way in the very near future the rba cash rate for december 03 implied by the overnight index swap market on wednesday was just 0 74 that suggests investors expect another two cuts in 2019 which is more than the fed is seen delivering above cba graph showing aud usd australian terms of trade and 3 year rate spread the inputs for this model are australian commodity export prices in us australia us 3 month interest rate spread and australia s current account deficit as a percentage of gdp says cba s mundy our currency forecasts are not reliant on the above models but we do take the inputs in each model into account when making our forecasts along with other factors it s important to remember that exchange rates can deviate for lengthy periods of time from model based estimates of fair value the rba has cited below target inflation and economic growth that is too soft to engineer a return of the consumer price index to the 2 to 3 target as the reasons for its rate cuts it s now watching the labour market closely for clues on what it needs to do next rba governor philip lowe has said the jobs market is key to the outlook for consumer spending the economy and its inflation target the bank says wage growth in the region of 3 above the rate of inflation per year is necessary to get the consumer price index above 2 but that faster wage growth requires a lower unemployment rate likely in the region of 4 5 according to the rba and the aussie jobless figure has risen 30 basis points to 5 2 in recent months meanwhile house prices and construction activity have continued to fall stoking fears over jobs in the sector house prices in australia s eight capital cities have fallen steeply in the last 18 months leading some to worry about the outlook for construction jobs as well as the possibility that negative wealth effects hurt household confidence and reduce growth by crimping consumer spending above cba graph showing australian unemployment rate vs jobs growth the australian dollar has already paid for the rba cuts that markets are betting on but that still leaves u s interest rate policy as a big and unknown variable that could influence the gap between bond yields of the two countries cba says fed policy is a highly important factor behind its australian dollar forecasts it projects the australian dollar will close around half of its undervaluation gap before the end of 2020 with the upturn beginning in december this year we believe a 25 basis point on 31 july is a virtual certainty powell and bullard emphasised that the case for more accommodative policy has strengthened we also believe there will be follow up cuts in december 2019 march 2020 and june 2020 the fed rate cuts will weigh on usd mundy says cba forecasts the aud usd rate will rise to 0 72 by year end and that it will finish the 2020 year up at 0 74 the pound to australian dollar rate is

a police officer is pictured at the venue for a g20 summit in osaka japan on wednesday charly triballeau afp protectionism will benefit no one experts warn ahead of g20 summit beijing tokyo ahead of the two day g20 summit in the japanese city of osaka on friday the international community is calling for joint efforts by major economies to help maintain global growth as the world is increasingly threatened by protectionism in the name of protecting domestic industries the united states has slapped steep tariffs on billions of dollars worth of products from its partners heightening trade tensions worldwide and rocking the foundation of the multilateral trading system today uncertainty is not so much about integration but about disintegration multilateralism and free trade have come under pressure for example with international trade conflicts said burkhard balz a member of the executive board of deutsche bundesbank moving toward isolationism and unilateralism damages the g20 spirit significantly said lee hee ok a professor of political science at sungkyunkwan university in seoul finance ministers from the g20 economies on june 9 issued a joint statement saying global growth remains low and risks remain tilted to the downside and listing trade tensions as the key factor the latest world trade outlook indicator reading at 96 3 is at the weakest level since 2010 signaling continued falling trade growth in the first half of 2019 said the world trade organization according to a key un trade report released earlier in june global foreign direct investment or fdi slid to 1 3 trillion dollars in 2018 its third straight annual decline factors such as escalating trade tensions risk continuing to weigh on fdi in 2019 and beyond said mukhisa kituyi secretary general of the un conference on trade and development economic prospects are now weaker in nearly all g20 countries than previously anticipated said the organization for economic cooperation and development or oecd in its recent interim economic outlook there are other major risks such as geopolitical tensions and climate crises kituyi said the main drag on fdi in europe is the negative pull of brexit in britain which has created considerable uncertainty in its latest monthly report the us energy information administration cut its 2019 world oil demand growth forecast by 0 2 million barrels per day bpd to 1 2 million bpd amid escalating tensions in the middle east according to the world bank air pollution costs societies more than 5 trillion dollars every year said joyce msuya deputy executive director of the un environment program need for consensus what concerns the international community the most is whether g20 economies can show solidarity at the upcoming summit in tackling the risks of global economic downturn although many g20 members have repeatedly called for coordination of economic policies over the past few years the bloc is still divided on certain thorny issues such as rising protectionism and climate change for example the g20 ministerial meeting earlier in june failed to include opposition to trade protectionism in the joint statement due to objections from the us side the us lost interest in cooperating in a multilateral format and actually stalled the process of reforming the system of global governance said yana leksyutina a professor from of st petersburg state university in russia the advanced economies attending the g20 summit should act positively to reach some agreement which would be beneficial to people across the world said qian meijun professor of the college of business and economics in the australian national university oecd chief economist laurence boone suggested governments should coordinate policy actions to avoid a further downturn in an interview atsushi sunami vice president at the national graduate institute for policy studies in tokyo called on all to understand the real impact of trade tensions and end the trade frictions as soon as possible there will not be any winner said political analyst takakage fujita he said the economic and trade friction provoked by the us hurts not only china but also us farmers as well as us industries which have already issued warnings against such reckless acts of the us government economy has no borders said tadashi yanai founder of the famous japanese clothing brand uniqlo adding that he hopes all could understand that the world is closely linked and people of all countries look forward to a peaceful and stable life many hope that g20 economies can take concrete actions such as returning to the negotiating table to alleviate trade tensions fujita suggested major economies like the us should from the perspective of being conducive to world peace and development return to talks and solve issues through rational negotiation and consultation according to japanese media reports on wednesday leaders of the g20 bloc will call this week for the promotion of free trade to achieve strong global growth in preparing a joint communique japan the chair of the meetings seeks common ground between the us which opposes language denouncing protectionism and other nations which want a stronger warning against the risk of trade tension a draft of the document shows g20 nations will highlight the promotion of free trade and technological innovation as two of the key drivers of the global economy the asahi newspaper said xinhua reuters

what can we learn from the three big collapses in the gold price since 1934 the causes have always included some combination of economic miracle respite from grave fiat money disorder most of all in the us hegemon anti gold regulations and global detente prudent analysts should never ignore these potential factors even when the gold price seems to have embarked on a new journey to the summits as has most likely been the case since winter 2015 and 2016 the gold price had sunk at that time to almost 1 000 per ounce from its multiple peaks in 2011 12 1 900 in summer 2011 that collapse reflected primarily the non emergence of high inflation in the us despite the vast money printing and long term rate manipulation under the first obama administration scared investors who had feared runaway inflation had not reckoned with the strong downward influence on prices of goods and services from globalization and digitalization nor had they fully digested the extent to which monetary radicalism had held back business spending in the us and other advanced economies given widespread concerns that another bubble bust cycle was under way fanning the gold price collapse of 2013 15 was continuous chatter from the fed about normalization ahead the oil and wider commodity market slump from late 2014 slotted into the growing narrative of no imminent goods and inflation danger normalization never came the yellen fed aborted all rate rises planned for 2016 in response to the growth cycle downturn and passing global asset market setback the ecb and boj embarked on monetary radicalism even starker than in the us briefly in 2018 excitement in the media that fed chief powell convinced big business tax cuts meant boom ahead was at last bringing monetary accommodation to an end triggered a faltering of the incipient gold price recovery events this year have re fuelled gold s rising trend from its end 2015 trough meanwhile news of continued low inflation does not impress many gold holders who worry about colossal budget deficits in the us and likely waning downward influences on prices from globalization and digitalization vast accumulated mal investment and the weakness of the invisible hand in the context of unsound money and strengthened monopoly capitalism does not encourage optimism for economic miracles this optimism was a key element in the epic gold price collapse from january 1980 to end 2002 in terms of 2018 dollars the gold price fell from 2 010 to 480 over those twenty two years in fact there were two sub collapses the first was the plunge to 750 2018 dollars in 1984 this reflected paul volcker s monetarist assault on the greatest peacetime inflation coupled with an extraordinarily high level of real us interest rates the height was in line with widespread speculation on the miracle of reaganomics the devaluation of the dollar at plaza autumn 1985 and beyond accompanied by the volcker greenspan monetary inflation of 1985 88 as directed by top white house official james baker led to a brief spring for gold then the disintegration of the soviet empire followed by the emergence of us economic miracle the it boom of 1995 99 helped bring a second collapse with 10 year real interest rates as quoted in the 10 year us tips market rising above 4 percent aggressive monetary ease from 2003 04 the greenspan bernanke fed breathing in inflation because it had fallen too low as an accompaniment to the bush administration s dollar devaluation policy ahead of the november 2004 election set gold on its second journey to the summits from 2003 to 2011 12 the first such journey had been from 1968 when the us ceased intervening in the free market to hold down the price of gold at 35 per ounce the free market was then mid 1960s just returning to life having long been choked by regulation starting with roosevelt s criminalization of private gold holdings within the us 1934 and then widespread exchange controls throughout the globe the dismantling of these accelerated from the late 1960s us gold ban lifted in december 1974 european and japanese exchange controls abolished through 1970s these restrictions had doubtless played a role in the long collapse of the gold price from 1934 to 1968 during which time the gold price in 2018 us purchasing power had fallen from 650 to 250 per ounce economic miracles also played an important role the mid 1950s to the mid 1960s were years of great economic miracles not just the famed ones in japan and germany but also in the us accordingly rates of return to capital were extraordinarily high dampening the appeal of gold even real interest rates were substantially positive albeit held well below the level which would have been in line with the miracles central bankers led by the martin fed sought to hold nominal rates down employing depression era regulations on credit and deposit interest rates for that purpose rapid productivity growth camouflaged underlying conditions of monetary inflation from showing up in goods and services markets the widely told story about how the gold link of the dollar under bretton woods acted as bulwark against monetary inflation is myth as soon as private gold markets came back to life the anchor role snapped march 1968 the remaining three years during which the official gold window remained open prolonged the opportunity for european governments to obtain the yellow metal from the us treasury at the bargain prices still available in looking at the gold price beyond the next summit we should be concerned about restrictions which could imperil the free market in gold the lone serious non fiat money is still in fragile condition due to government restraints there is virtually no scope for banks or other financial institutions to develop bullion banking in which gold deposits could be used as a medium of payment where clearing between the institutions would take place at a central gold depot whether nationally or internationally regulators defend their veto here in terms of the wider war against cash highlighting concerns that gold hoards include a criminal element whose money laundering operations could flourish in bullion banks the bundesbanker s advice that outlawing large denomination notes due to their use by criminals is akin to banning mercedes benz autos because the mafia like driving them does not go down well with the regulators the gold bulls might be right that gold is safe against new regulation so long as the republicans hold the white house the likelihood is not trivial however that washington will eventually join in imposing new regulations on gold trading and international shipments perhaps in time for the next price collapse albeit from a new record high summit read in

offering ip owners a competitive edge smes invest a huge amount of time energy and money related to endeavours in r d and marketing yet frequently neglect that in most countries the only way to enjoy exclusive rights over their creative efforts and their business identity trademark is through ip registration a wide range of foreign industries are now looking towards southeast asia not just to take advantage of an abundance of cheap labour for production of goods for export but also to tap into new consumer markets formed from a growing middle class population but the less developed nature of business related legislation means the dangers of intellectual property ip infringement are often great all the different types of ip share a common characteristic they are creations of the mind and feature unique and distinguishing characteristics that differentiates them from other ip in the business world this uniqueness is monetarily profitable ip is an important strategic asset for business due to the territorial nature of ipr enforcement without registrations in advance in the countries of interest is generally not possible most countries including the european union eu member states and partners in south east asia have accepted and adopted the same international treaties and agreements relating to ip and hence ip such as trade marks invention patents utility patents industrial designs copyrights are recognised and protected south east asia has become an increasingly popular destination for the european small medium sized enterprises smes as the rapid economic development in the region has created many promising business opportunities for european smes the international property rights index ipri 2017 performance reflects the strength of the countries patent and trademark

organizations have depended on a powerful ip framework for their ventures and this is important as asia s economies keep on developing ip provides the necessary framework and incentives to ensure the constant generation of new ideas ipr enforcement in south east asia particularly the development of ip laws across south east asia has been uneven and ip laws in many south east asian countries are

which has a unified instrument directing ipr enforcement south east asian countries do not yet share the same level of cooperation resulting in comparatively fragmented ipr enforcement laws and regulations implementation of ipr laws across south east asian countries vary from one another another this is mostly due to the diversity of culture history and laws in the region the association of south east asian nations asean however has established the asean working group on intellectual property cooperation awgipc which aims to align and streamline ip rights and practices across the region and more changes should be expected from this collaboration taking note that the south east asia region is a strong global manufacturing hub and a dynamic growing purchaser market it is not unusual for companies to encounter locally or regionally produced counterfeit goods which affect the ip owner s ability to derive proprietary benefits counterfeit cases are typically reported by the ip owner s own sales channels market study reports e commerce and now even more increasingly social media accounts and reports by ip owner s customers so we see stopping production of counterfeit goods is one

country rank singapore 7 malaysia 32 phillipines 64 thailand 66 indoneasia 68 in 2017 the ipri scores reveal a general improvement in all countries except malaysia singapore has increased its ipr score from 7 96 in year 2016 to 8 1 in year 2017 malaysia s overall score has also decreased from 6 75 in year 2016 to 6 6 in year 2017 despite this decrease malaysian officials have augmented their resources to combat online piracy and have sustained their efforts to deny access to piracy websites taking down infringing content on domestic sites and conducting raids and arrests of malaysians either operating or posting links to sites with pirated content threats and challenges threats and challenges to ip protection and enforcement in asean countries in general include patent and trademark counterfeiting and copyright piracy these threats cause significant financial losses for right holders and legitimate businesses ip infringement can also pose risks to the general public inferior counterfeit food and medicines for example can present health risks to consumers in addition ip infringing activities can also be a source of funding for organized criminal networks and therefore present a wider threat to society there are multiple reports of weaknesses in the enforcement of ipr across asean demonstrated by the varied performance in the ipri now let s see individually ipr regime of some of the south east nations singapore singapore has been struggling with relatively high levels of illegal downloading singapore has developed some legal measures that provide necessary exclusive rights preventing infringement of copyrights and related rights including web hosting streaming and linking and availability of frameworks that promote cooperative action against online piracy this has led to an amendment to the copyright act which provides rights holders with an avenue to apply directly to the high court for an injunction requiring the network service provider to take reasonable steps to disable access to the infringing online location as the authority responsible for border enforcement of ip rights singapore customs detains tens of thousands of counterfeit goods each year including luxury bags shoes and other fashion items toys perfumes mobile phones and accessories singapore had no intellectual property system of its own and it relied on the re registration of intellectual property rights protected in the uk it established a set of intellectual property laws between 1987 and 2000 comprising copyright trade mark and design acts and an act protecting the layout designs of integrated circuits different from other countries in the region but perhaps typically for singapore the country has also managed to enforce the new rights effectively intellectual property law is now an important part of legal education and an ip academy for research and training has been founded to assist with this task and to provide further training for the profession the ip administration and interested members of the public singapore has ambitious plans in a number of areas that require intellectual property protection in particular in the field of biotechnology so we see counterfeit goods and illegal downloading are major issues in singapore related to protection of intellectual property rights steps taken intellectual property office of singapore ipos is proposing to bring together the government agencies and private sector to enable better ip commercialisation outcomes ipos has also started to expand by collaborating with institutes of higher learning their intention is to build a pipeline of ip experts with an understanding of law technology and business who can help companies unlock their intangible assets and get the right ip strategy in place change the general mind set towards ip it is not just a legal right that should be enforced and respected but also a business strategy and bring together financiers ip professionals lawyers and other experts to create that flow in the innovation cycle malaysia malaysia has some concerns on pharmaceutical related patent enforcement and resolution mechanisms patent term restoration for pharmaceutical products regulatory data protection terms and effective border measures the legislation in malaysia is also complete and largely trips compliant the intellectual property administration in the country has improved considerably since the ip office has been incorporated as a body corporate and a statutory body in 2003 the new form of organisation gives the malaysian intellectual property office myipo more freedom to regulate its own affairs with regards to its employees and the use of its funds although the office remains under the directions and supervision of the minister of domestic trade and consumer affairs problems remain in the enforcement sector and with the judiciary statistics show that the malaysian courts are overloaded and backlogged problems focus on south east asia _ftn7 as in other countries of the region discussions are underway to form a specialised intellectual property court to solve this problem and while serious efforts have been made to improve the enforcement of intellectual property rights malaysia is still struggling with its reputation as the world s most significant producer exporter of pirated optical disk entertainment software we see the problem of counterfeit goods and online piracy as was there in singapore is also there in malaysia plus malaysia is also facing the problem of export and production of pirated disc though the author feels after the incorporation of a statutory body in malaysia regarding protection of ipr things are moving in the right direction though there is still a long way to go steps taken malaysia officials have invested in greater resources to combat online piracy the malaysian authorities are actively taking down ip infringing content and conducting raids and arrests of malaysians either operating or posting links to sites with pirated content malaysia has introduced ip enforcement coordination mechanisms and agreements to enhance interagency cooperation in deterring and preventing networks that distribute counterfeit and infringing goods the progress is shown by an interagency special anti piracy task force malaysia has also developed specialized ip enforcement units including the special internet forensics unit sifu in malaysia s ministry of domestic trade cooperatives and consumerism responsible for ip enforcement that have also been proven to be important catalysts in the fight against counterfeiting and piracy vietnam being a member of the world trade organization and world intellectual property organization vietnam s ip legislation covers most aspec ts of protection of ip in accordance with the international standards required by the agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property rights trips agreement however vietnam s ip enforcement mechanisms still need improvement and awareness of the importance of ipr protection among vietnamese consumers needs to be raised vietnam is a party to the patent cooperation treaty pct and the madrid agreement concerning the international registration of marks known as the madrid system patent and trademark applicants may use these international systems for filing international patent and trademark applications for requesting protection in vietnam the copyright office of vietnam cov administers copyright protection law although copyrights can be protected in vietnam without any registration requirement formal recordation of copyrights at the cov is recommended as it would be useful as evidence of ownership in the event of a dispute in 2007 vietnam joined the rome convention for the protection of performers producers of phonograms and broadcasting organizations while significant progress on the legal regime for protecting ipr has taken place in recent years enforcement of ipr remains inadequate at the street and market level at least regarding trademark violations a wide variety of consumer products bearing false or misleading labels are also readily available in the markets as are counterfeit labels themselves in recent years on line sales of counterfeit goods and illegal movie streaming have been rampant enforcement of on line ip infringement has been of serious concern there are several enforcement agencies involved in and vested with authority to address ipr infringement issues these include the ministry of science and technology inspectorate the ministry of culture sports and tourism inspectorate the ministry of industry and trade s market management bureau the ministry of public security s economic police the ministry of finance customs office and the people s court civil court thus there are no clear cut lines of responsibility among these agencies generally sending warning letters to infringers or bringing civil actions to the courts has not been very effective warning letters that are not accompanied by a decision of infringement from the national office of intellectual property noip are often ignored and court actions are lengthy and relatively costly in vietnam we see there are problems in ip enforcement as there is not one agency of government specifically dedicated to for ip protection and ip disputes the problem of using false labels in goods counterfeiting and illegal movie streaming is also widespread well these are common problems related to ip protection but the steps the government takes related to these problems is an important issue now let s see the legal framework in south east asia for ipr enforcement through this table to assure timely processing of ip cases with accurate and consistent application of ip law many countries have established a dedicated legal framework specifically for ipr enforcement which typically involves the establishment of both a specialised court having competency in dealing with ip and specialised procedural rules to be observed by such courts below is summary of countries in south east asia where such specialised ip courts or specialised ip court procedures within civil litigation are available country avalability of ip courts availability of ip rules brunei no no cambodia no no indonesia yes yes laos no no malaysia yes yes myanmar no no phillipines yes yes singapore yes yes thailand yes yes vietnam no no we see in vietnam myanmar laos cambodia and brunei there is still need to develop proper ipr enforcement agency which would focus only on ipr related issues lastly let s have a look at myanmar legal system related to ipr myanamar relevant laws related to ip in myanmar type of ip substantive law related laws trademark nil penal code merchandise marks act specific relief act sea customs act registration act 1908 copyright burma copyright act 1914 specific relief act television video law motion picture law patent nil patent and design emergency provisions act 1946 specific relief act industrial design nil patent and design emergency provisions act specific relief act so myanmar has no statutory law for ip protection there are only general laws for ip protection myanmar s long awaited trademark law was signed into law on january 30 2019 establishing the framework for a comprehensive trademark registration system open to both foreign and domestic trademark owners once the administrative bodies and enabling legislation to support this system are in place all existing trademark owners who have recorded their rights under myanmar s old system will have to file new applications to protect their marks under the new law ip landscape in south east asia and challenges patent protection in south east asia registrations and challenges companies owning patents and doing or planning to do business in south east asia may wish to create long term value by either finding investors who believe in the economic value of their invention or by licensing patents it is crucial that smes apply for patent protection in those south east asian countries of interest to their business as patents registered in europe being territorial rights have no legal protection in any other country other than the country of registration smes are strongly advised to become familiar with the local patent protection systems in south east asian countries invention patent applications can be typically filed in english in most of the south east asian countries but smes should keep in mind that indonesia thailand and vietnam require the applications to be filed in their respective languages as of today the timing for obtaining the grant of a patent in south east asian countries can be quite long up to 5 to 8 years in thailand 3 to 5 years in indonesia 2 to 4 years in brunei 4 to 5 years in laos and therefore eu smes are recommended to put in place a well thought strategy to maximize protection costs for obtaining a patent in the different south east asian countries vary in each country and are in a range from eur 2 000 00 to eur 7 000 00 in order to protect your trade mark in the countries of south east asia registrations are recommended and required certain south east asia countries such as singapore allow protection of unregistered trade marks based on laws which protect rights against passing off or rights against unfair competition in some cases local judges may still only recognize establishment of trade identity protection through national registration among the ten countries of the asean economic community brunei cambodia laos philippines singapore and vietnam are members of the madrid system administered by wipo which means that smes can opt to register their trade mark in many south east asian countries simultaneously by filing only one basic application and then designating the countries of their interest at the same time or at a later stage with no time limitations for the extension as of today some major countries of south east asia are not yet party to the madrid system including indonesia malaysia myanmar and thailand additionally brunei indonesia philippines cambodia laos vietnam thailand and singapore provide for a multi class application system but malaysia requires separate trade mark applications for each class of goods and services similarly to patent applications indonesia thailand and vietnam require the trade mark applications to be filed in their respective languages implementation of ipr laws across south east asia also tends to vary from one country to another owing in part to the diversity of culture history economic and legislative development in the region thus when enforcing ip rights smes should keep in mind that private mediation might be more effective than judicial proceedings in some countries enforcement is generally rather challenging in south east asia as in many countries criminal prosecution and civil action tend to be long and therefore costly additionally due to the limited experience and training of law enforcement officers and judges outcomes and decisions on ipr issues tend to be inconsistent lack of transparency and established criteria concerning the determination of compensation for damages is also still commonplace in south east asia further contributing to the unpredictability or inconsistency of the judgements to ensure timely processing of ip cases with accurate and consistent application of ip law some south east asian countries have dedicated legal framework specifically for ipr enforcement typically involving the establishment of both a specialised court having competency in dealing with ip and specialised procedural rules to be observed by such courts currently malaysia and singapore are among the few countries in the region with dedicated ip courts and specialised judges recommendations to establish necessary infrastructure of ip office including registration system and enforcement where there is no particular agency governing ipr issues comprehensive and effective ip protection system to promote foreign investment and technology transfer as well as industrial development developing human resources and promoting the quality of staff is important when establishing an ip office technical assistance is needed when setting up the ip infrastructure in collaboration with local and international organizations the scale of counterfeiting remains very high fake products are being continuously produced and marketed globally the consumers are being endangered due to the high exposure to inferior products in the market strict penal provisions should be laid out for protection against such acts online piracy has been a growing problem as the access to the internet has widened illegal downloads of many media contents either for private use or for reselling have become open to the public mechanism to check online piracy should be there the capacity of ip agencies needto be strengthened to develop a conducive ip environment raise public awareness on ip issues and provide the right skills to identify and support the innovation that contributes to economic growth the time frame for granting ip applications have not been effective yet in some asean countries such as indonesia and thailand there have been backlog of applications including delays of 5 to 9 years for patents in thailand some inefficiencies of bureaucracy have created the deceleration to ip support business and entrepreneurs also have to contribute and make efforts to improve the environment for ip through ensuring a plan for such protection since ip is a crucial component for business strategy making it s observed that certain legislative measures by the government also tend to constrain the uses of a holder s ipr for example indonesia passed legislation that requires patent holders to produce the patented product in indonesia although the indonesian government had some positive reasons for exercising this legislation the implementation of this legislation will discourage the business and entrepreneur due to the high cost implementation many businesses and entrepreneurs perceive that the government should instead focus on creating the best possible environment for innovation and to encourage the development and production of patented products the threats that each asean country is facing has forced each country to improve both their administration and legislative enforcement including improving cooperation between government agencies and the private sector so the need is to establish formal mechanisms for greater cooperation with the private sector introduce effective legislation to require internet service providers to remove ip infringing content from the internet as fast as possible improve ip enforcement agency capacity to reduce backlogs and increase efficiency of process tor recognising legitimate intellectual property government regulations should focus on promoting and enforcing intellectual property rights there is a need to develop government agencies which would particularly focus on intellectual property infringement cases instead of many legislations taking care of ipr issues there is a need that there should be one legislation governing only ipr issues then the offenders will become aware of the punishment laid out for ipr related offences south east asian countries like myanmar should be made aware of the advantages of being part of international ipr conventions like bern paris conventions there should be one confederation of south east asian nations which will deal with online piracy there could be one cyber security cell regarding this in each country a comprehensive intellectual property code could be made all ip offices that are usually part of the government and as such pay wages mostly cannot compete with the private sector under the circumstances it is difficult to attract technically qualified personnel it seems that one important consideration for this step was to provide more financial incentives to examiners who are now supposed to become stakeholders in the efficient performance of the office conclusion while a smaller asean at the beginning of the 1990s consisted of countries at very similar levels of intellectual property protection the picture of intellectual property protection in asean is now much more diverse an important reason for this is the enlargement of asean that has added countries classified as least developed such as laos and myanmar in addition singapore has achieved developed country status and older members of asean such as indonesia have been preoccupied with political and social problems so that asean members have recently been drifting in different directions in intellectual property developments we could say that legislative reform is proceeding at a fast pace we must not forget that the value of ip protection shall be anchored in the ability of companies to effectively and efficiently enforce their ip rights finally the countries of the region are particularly pressurised to set up the institutions supporting the intellectual property system often within a very short time frame again specialisation has been the preferred solution and attempts have been made to separate intellectual property to some extent from the general administrative and legal system examples for this development are the specialised intellectual property and international trade court in thailand which has been followed by semispecialised commercial courts in indonesia and the philippines while other countries are considering the introduction of a more specialised court system though it is obviously difficult and a time consuming process for developing countries with insufficient administrative resources to create the rather sophisticated administration that an intellectual property rights system requires a clear vision of an ip strategy in south east asia can impact a company s growth and prevent loss of revenue further down the road a successful ip protection strategy therefore necessarily includes a careful selection of effective legal tools and business partners in order to make sure the infringers are continuously kept at bay from being able to harm the ip owner its valuable assets and its customers to conclude we can say that even though ip enforcement remains challenging in south east asia it is not entirely impossible understanding local practices and implementing a strategy in advance is the key to ip enforcement in south east asia eu small medium enterprises seeking to protect their ip rights in the south east asian region should thus consult with legal service providers having local expertise and who would be able to navigate the practical and operational considerations in place in the country in order to best serve their needs for enforcement counterfeiting and online piracy are the common problems related to intellectual property rights in south east asia thus steps are needed to control these problems then there is a need of uniform ipr enforcement in these regions there is a need to establish ip courts which would specifically focus on ipr issues south east region needs to have stringent laws regarding ip violations

u s economic growth accelerated in the first quarter the government confirmed on thursday but the export and inventory boost to activity masked weakness in domestic demand some of which appears to have prevailed in the current period federal reserve chairman jerome powell last week acknowledged the temporary lift to economic growth from trade and inventories which he described as components that are not generally reliable indicators of ongoing momentum the u s central bank last wednesday signaled interest rate cuts as early as july citing rising risks to the economy especially from an escalation in the trade conflict between the united states and china and low inflation first quarter gdp paints a misleading picture of the u s economy s vigor at the start of the year and second quarter gdp will come as a timely reminder that the economy is now well past its inflection point said lydia boussour a senior u s economist at oxford economics in new york gross domestic product increased at a 3 1 annualized rate also driven by more spending on highways and defense the commerce department said in its third reading of first quarter gdp that was unchanged from its estimate last month and in line with economists expectations the economy grew at a 2 2 pace in the october december period despite the unchanged reading growth in consumer spending was revised lower and business investment in intellectual property products was stronger than previously estimated there were also upward revisions to spending on nonresidential structures and government expenditure revisions to the trade deficit and inventory accumulation were minor excluding trade inventories and government spending the economy grew at only a 1 3 rate in the first quarter that was the slowest rise in this measure of domestic demand since the second quarter of 2013 when measured from the income side the economy grew at a tepid 1 0 rate in the last quarter gross domestic income gdi was previously reported to have increased at a rate of 1 4 the income side of the growth ledger was curbed by a dip in profits after tax profits without inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustment which correspond to s p 500 profits fell at a 0 2 rate as earnings of domestic nonfinancial corporations decreased the average of gdp and gdi also referred to as gross domestic output and considered a better measure of economic activity increased at a 2 1 rate in the january march period down from the 2 2 growth pace estimated last month inflation was also muted in the first quarter a gauge of inflation tracked by the fed increased at a 1 2 rate revised up from the previously reported 1 0 pace the economy will mark 10 years of expansion in july the longest on record but momentum is slowing with manufacturing struggling the trade deficit widening again and the housing sector still mired in a soft patch while consumer spending appears to have regained speed in the second quarter business investment in equipment is expected to have contracted further following wednesday s weak report on durable goods orders in may the trade war between washington and beijing is hurting both business and consumer confidence just as the expansion is set to become the longest in u s history recession fears have increased said scott hoyt a senior economist at moody s analytics in west chester pennsylvania u s businesses appear spooked by the president s capricious trade policy the atlanta fed is forecasting gdp growth to rise at a 1 9 annualized rate in the april june quarter the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies while u s treasury prices edged up u s stocks were trading higher jobless claims rise though a separate report from the labor department on thursday showed the number of americans filing applications for unemployment benefits rose more than expected last week there is still no sign of a significant pickup in layoffs as economic growth shifts into lower gear initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 10 000 to a seasonally adjusted 227 000 for the week ended june 22 the four week moving average of initial claims considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week to week volatility rose 2 250 to 221 250 last week job creation may be slowing but employers do not appear to be trimming their payrolls more aggressively said jim baird chief investment officer at plante moran financial advisors in kalamazoo michigan the gdp report showed the trade deficit narrowed to 905 0 billion in the first quarter instead of 903 6 billion as reported last month trade contributed 0 94 percentage point to gdp rather than the 0 96 percentage point estimated last month the u s china trade tensions have caused wild swings in the trade deficit with exporters and importers trying to stay ahead of the tariff fight between the two economic giants the standoff has also had an impact on inventories growth in inventories was revised down to a 122 8 billion rate in the first quarter from the previously estimated 125 5 billion pace part of the inventory build was because of weak demand inventories contributed 0 55 percentage point to first quarter gdp rather than the 0 60 percentage point reported last month growth in consumer spending which accounts for more than two thirds of u s economic activity was revised down to a 0 9 rate the weakest in a year from the previously reported pace of 1 3 business spending on equipment declined at an unrevised rate of 1 0 rate the worst performance in three years government investment increased at a 2 8 rate up from the 2 5 rate reported last month
donald j trump s 2020 election strategy is to connect his potential democratic opponents with socialism trump plans to use this attack on the democrats even if senator bernie sanders who proudly calls himself a democratic socialist doesn t become the presidential nominee sanders has been decisively re elected in vermont senator elizabeth warren is distancing herself from the socialist label she went so far as to tell the new england council i am a capitalist to my bones sanders and warren are not what they claim to be they are both updating roosevelt s new deal and more closely resemble the social democrats that have governed western european democracies for years delivering higher standards of living than that experienced by americans the original doctrine of socialism meant government ownership of the means of production heavy industries railroads banks and the like nobody in national politics today is suggesting such a takeover as one quipster put it how can washington take ownership of the banks when the banks own washington confronting trump on the socialism taboo can open up a great debate about the value of government intervention for the good of the public sanders can effectively argue that people must choose either democratic socialism or the current failing system of corporate socialism that choice is not difficult such an american democratic socialism could provide almost all of the long overdue solutions this country needs full more efficient medicare for all tuition free education living wages stronger unions a tax system that works for the people investments in infrastructure and public works reforms for a massive runaway military budget the end of most corporate welfare government promotion of renewable energies and the end of subsidies for fossil fuels and nuclear power in my presidential campaigns i tried to make corporate socialism also called corporate welfare or crony capitalism a major issue small business is capitalism free to go bankrupt while corporate capitalism free to get bailouts from washington is really a form of corporate socialism this point about a corporate government was documented many years ago in books such as america inc 1971 by morton mintz and jerry cohen now it is even easier to make the case that our political economy is largely controlled by giant corporations and their political toadies today the concentration of power and wealth is staggering just six capitalist men have wealth to equal the wealth of half of the world s population the wall street collapse of 2008 2009 destroyed eight million jobs lost trillions of dollars in pension and mutual funds and pushed millions of families to lose their homes against this backdrop the u s government used trillions of taxpayer dollars to bail out in various ways the greedy financial giants whose reckless speculating caused the collapse in may 2009 the moderate senator from illinois dick durbin said the banks hard to believe when we re facing a banking crisis that many of the banks created are still the most powerful lobby on capitol hill and they frankly own the place is there a single federal government agency or department that can say its most powerful outside influence is not corporate even the labor department and the national labor relations board are under more corporate power than union power who better than trump on an anti socialist fantasy campaign kick can call attention to the reality that big business controls the government and by extension controls the people in september 2000 a business week poll found over 70 percent of people agreeing that big business has too much control over their lives this was before the horrific corporate crimes and scandals of the past two decades maybe that is why support in polls for socialism against capitalism in the u s is at a 60 year high people have long experienced american style socialism for example the publicly owned water and electric utilities public parks and forests the postal service public libraries fdic guarantees of bank deposits now up to 250 000 social security medicare and medicaid etc what the public is not sufficiently alert to is that big business has been profitably taking over control if not outright ownership of these public assets in the new book banking on the people by ellen brown readers can get an idea of the way large banks insurers and the giant shadow banking system money market funds hedge funds mortgage brokers and other unregulated financial intermediaries speculate and shift deep risk and their failures onto uncle sam these corporate predators gouge customers and remarkably show a deep aversion for productive investment as if people matter moreover they just keep developing new ever riskier multi tiered instruments eg derivatives to make money from money through evermore complex abstract secret reckless entangled globally destabilizing networks gambling with other people s money is a relentless wall street tradition the crashes that inevitably emerge end up impoverishing ordinary people who pay the price with their livelihoods will the democrats and other engaged people take trump on if he tries to make socialism the big scare in 2020 control of our political economy is not a conservative liberal or red state blue state issue when confronted with the specifics of the corporate state or corporate socialism people from all political persuasions will recognize the potential perils to our democracy no one wants to lose essential freedoms or to continue to pay the price of this runaway crony capitalism the gigantic corporations have been built with the thralldom of deep debt corporate debt to fund stock buybacks while reporting record profits consumer debt student loan debt and of course government debt caused by drastic corporate and super rich tax cuts many trillions of dollars have been stolen from future generations no wonder a small group of billionaires including george soros eli broad and nick hanauer have just publicly urged a modest tax on the super wealthy as hanauer a history buff and advocate of higher minimum wages says the pitchforks are coming this article

the well known economist who accurately predicted the housing crisis of 2008 says that america is in a recession albeit a mild one gary shilling the economist and financial analyst thinks the united states is in the midst of a slight downturn i think we re probably already in a recession but i think it will probably be a run of the mill affair which means real gdp would decline 1 5 per cent to 2 per cent not the 3 5 per cent to 4 per cent you had in the very serious recessions said shilling who is president of a shilling co while the stock market may not go into a freefall as it did during other more serious recessions it will likely dip somewhat according to shilling in an interview with real vision he predicted that stocks would drop about 22 per cent gary shilling the economist and financial analyst thinks the united states is in the midst of a slight downturn shilling says that the current recession could be attributed to a decline in industrial production as well as a slowdown in the global economy exacerbating matters is the trump administration s trade war with china in more bad news for the economy u s consumer confidence tumbled to a 21 month low in june as households grew a bit more pessimistic about business and labor market conditions amid concerns about a recent escalation in trade tensions with china the economy s prospects were further dimmed by other data on tuesday showing sales of new single family homes unexpectedly fell for a second straight month in may growing risks to the economy especially related to the trade war between washington and beijing and low inflation prompted the federal reserve last week to signal interest rate cuts beginning as early as july the headwinds from the ongoing trade war the economy faces are definitely growing stronger and it will be a miracle if fed officials can pull a rabbit out of their hats and keep the economy moving forward said chris rupkey chief economist at mufg in new york the conference board said its consumer confidence index dropped 9 8 points to a reading of 121 5 this month the lowest since september 2017 from a downwardly revised 131 3 in may this month s drop in the index was the largest since july 2015 the index which was previously reported at 134 1 in may still remains at lofty levels suggesting consumer spending remains supported the conference board blamed the decline on the trade tensions and cautioned that continued uncertainty at some point could even begin to diminish consumers confidence in the expansion the economy will mark 10 years of growth next month the longest expansion on record president trump last month imposed additional tariffs of up to 25 per cent on 200billion of chinese goods prompting retaliation by beijing trump has threatened more duties on chinese imports if no deal is reached at a group of 20 nations summit this week in japan economists polled by reuters had forecast the consumer confidence index at 131 1 in june the conference board survey showed a decrease in the share of consumers with a favorable assessment of business conditions this month the survey s so called labor market differential derived from data about respondents who think jobs are hard to get and those who think jobs are plentiful fell to a one year low of 27 6 per cent in june from 33 5 per cent in may that measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the labor department s employment report the rolling over that we are seeing here in jobs plentiful is worryingly reminiscent of what we have seen late in prior cycles said tim quinlan a senior economist at wells fargo securities in charlotte north carolina trade tensions with china is also being blamed for some of the data indicating a slowdown in the economy president trump is seen above at the white house on wednesday if past patterns hold without a turnaround in this series job growth could slow in coming months the economy created 75 000 jobs in may a sharp step down from 224 00 in april last month s tepid job gains were largely viewed as an anomaly given that a key labor market indicator weekly claims for unemployment benefits remains low job growth has averaged 164 000 per month this year compared to 223 000 in 2018 the pace of job gains however remains well above the roughly 100 000 needed per month to keep up with growth in the working age population the unemployment rate is hovering near a 50 year low of 3 6 per cent the dollar was trading higher against a basket of currencies while u s treasury prices were mixed stocks on wall street were trading lower gross domestic product growth estimates for the second quarter are ranging from a 1 5 per cent to 2 4 per cent annualized rate the economy grew at a 3 1 per cent rate in the first quarter slowing growth was underscored by a separate report from the commerce department on tuesday showing new home sales dropped 7 8 per cent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 626 000 units in may the lowest in five months april s sales pace was revised up to 679 000 units from the previously reported 673 000 units economists had forecast new home sales which account for about 10 5 per cent of housing market sales rising 1 9 per cent to a pace of 680 000 units in may new home sales are drawn from permits and tend to be volatile on a month to month basis sales fell 3 7 per cent from a year ago the dow jones industrial average finished down more than 11 points on wednesday the housing market has remained sluggish even as mortgage rates have dropped with builders continuing to complain about land and labor shortages tariffs on chinese imports are also worrying homebuilders lennar corp the no 2 u s homebuilder said on tuesday the impact of tariffs on chinese goods resulted

corelogic case shiller composite index of home prices in 20 metropolitan areas rose 2 5 per cent in april on a year over year basis after increasing 2 6 per cent in march house price inflation has been slowing after last year s surge in mortgage rates dampened demand for housing a slowing economy will constrain housing demand and that implies house price growth will continue to ease to around 2 per cent year on year by the end of this year said matthew pointon property economist at capital economics in new york we doubt lower interest rates means housing demand will continue to climb after all home buying sentiment is subdued and banks are no longer loosening lending standards
oil and petroleum products carolyn kissane academic director and clinical professor at the center for global affairs at new york university leads the conversation on the geopolitics of oil faskianos thank you welcome to the final session of the winter spring 2023 cfr academic webinar series i m irina faskianos vice president of the national program and outreach here at cfr today s discussion is on the record and the video and transcript will be available on our website cfr org academic if you would like to share these materials with your colleagues or classmates as always cfr takes no institutional positions on matters of policy we are delighted to have carolyn kissane with us to discuss the geopolitics of oil dr kissane is the academic director of both the graduate program in global affairs and the graduate program in global security conflict and cybercrime at nyu s center for global affairs where she is also a clinical professor she also serves as director of the energy climate justice and sustainability lab in the school of professional studies at nyu she was named in 2013 by breaking energy as one of the top ten new york women in energy and top ten energy communicator she s a member of the council on foreign relations and the national committee on u s china relations and serves on several boards so carolyn thanks very much for doing this we really appreciate it i thought we could begin by talking about how has the geopolitics of oil changed especially vis à vis russia s war in ukraine and opec s recent announcement to cut oil production kissane well first of all i d just like to say thank you so very much for having me i m really delighted i am a big fan of cfr s academic webinars so to have the opportunity to participate in this in this way is very meaningful to me so thank you so wow there is so much happening in this space the geopolitics of oil this has been a tremendous fourteen months russia s reinvasion of ukraine very much upended the geopolitics of oil because russia is a significant producer one of the top three in the world and it s you know it s caused a kind of a reshaping a kind of a remapping of the of oil geopolitics and we ve seen some you know shifts in how countries think about oil security in light of larger questions about broader energy security questions and also on top of that is the ongoing energy transition coupled with you know climate change and the need to decarbonize so there s just it s been quite a you know a year and a half that has really sort of put energy security and oil security very much at the forefront of people s minds faskianos fantastic i thought maybe you had some really interesting data to show us and if you could walk us through those the trends you are seeing and really bring it to life that would be fantastic kissane sure so before i do i have a couple of slides and before i share my slides i think it s really important that sort of we understand how interconnected sort of the global energy system is and how interconnected we are when it comes to the flows of oil you know some countries are very well resourced endowed so they have oil and other countries do not so they need to import oil there s really no country in the world that doesn t need oil for larger national security issues and i think one of things that many people sort of are not necessarily aware of or think about is the amount of oil that gets produced every day so every day the world consumes over 100 million barrels a day and every day that 100 million barrels has to be has to be moved it has to be you know as part of getting it into the system getting it to its respective destinations and what we re not seeing which maybe some people may have thought that we would see at this point is we re not seeing a reduction in demand but we re seeing an expansion in demand and much of that global demand is coming out of asia and we re also of course seeing the with the reopening of china lots of really interesting questions as to what oil demand will be in china for the 2023 2024 years whether or not they will they will sort of put extra pressure on global demand and you know irina just also you know it s i m going to share this in my slides but you know last week s decision from opec to reduce production of course had an impact on the price of oil so when the decision was announced on sunday by monday morning we saw an uptick in the price it s stabilized but we are sort of looking at 80 plus a barrel oil and again lots of uncertainty as to what that s going to mean across economies that are in recessions experiencing sort of the beginnings of a recession and sort of what does it mean for the global economy where we may see sort of more energy inflation so one of the things that i really like to do when i teach the geopolitics of oil is sort of show some visuals because i think again sort of really reinforcing the interconnected nature of our global energy system but also sort of seeing where in the world is oil produced and where in the world are the are the importers and also just a couple of sort of fun pieces on what we have seen just this you know in the last week of course some of this you ll be familiar with those in the audience but this decision on the part of opec to reduce production by 1 2 million barrels a day again happening at a time not when we have an excess supply but when we re seeing a tight supply across the oil market so it came as a bit of a surprise to you know to even the most you know longstanding analysts and opec observers and again part of this is directed probably toward self interests on the part of saudi arabia and the oil producers that are really going to make the cuts but of course it also has an impact here for those of you that are sitting in the united states what does it mean then for prices that americans pay at the gas pump so the biden administration sort of came out after this decision was made in sort of being disappointed surprised that opec would make this decision now it s also important to sort of recognize that this is not just a singular opec decision this is part of now a larger opec and opec does also include russia as well as other countries like kazakhstan and mexico so the opec that we have historically known is now different because you have other countries that are not official members but nonetheless are part of what we now refer to as opec and these are the countries that are part of opec and really the country that s considered to be sort of in the driver s seat of opec is that of saudi arabia because saudi arabia is the largest producer within the opec organization producing anywhere from 10 to 11 million barrels a day venezuela has the largest reserves but it is far from being at capacity in terms of what it can what it can produce so just to kind of put that into perspective these are opec countries and their respective reserves and then non opec the united states being a non opec country but again this sort of this chart to the right shows you know again the world is consuming a little over 100 million barrels a day expected to increase over 2023 and into 2024 question marks as to when we may see peak oil demand but again to sort of link this to energy security energy security especially when it s in the context of oil security is making sure that we have adequate supply at affordable prices so when we see a reduction in supply at a time of tight markets that suggests that we re also going to see higher prices that s going to directly hit vulnerable economies and so again just to sort of point out sort of where in the world sort of are the top three oil producers the united states saudi arabia and russia russia remains in the top three canada as well our you know neighbor to the north and china is also a producer of oil the united states figure here also includes gas liquefied so liquid petroleum which the united states is endowed with a lot of both oil and natural gas and then the top oil consuming countries you have u s china and india now the united states is not the largest importer that position is now held by china but as far as consumption goes we consume over 20 million barrels a day again big question mark about china in terms of whether or not we will see higher demand coming out of china over the next year two years with china s reopening and what is being you know discussed as revenge tourism and more chinese who have accumulated a lot of savings 2 1 trillion how are they going to use that savings and whether or not after three years of being under lockdown restrictions whether or not we ll see impacts to demand and i think russia is there s lots of questions about russia and this is now we re fourteen months into you know russia s reinvasion of ukraine and i emphasize reinvasion because oftentimes we forget that you know russia invaded ukraine in 2014 but russia is still moving its oil and up until you know a few months ago its overall production and exports were as high at some points even higher than pre invasion now you have new countries that are takers of russian oil and they re buying it at discounted prices we see turkey singapore china has been a big buyer as well as india that they have been buying discounted russian oil lots of interesting questions that we could discuss about the oil price cap and seaborne embargo to europe but i think the takeaway from this slide is that russia continues to produce oil continues to sell it selling at a discounted price but there are still many countries in the world that are eager to take russian oil and again i m not going to go into this but i just love this slide to just emphasize the you know the world s pipelines these are the pipelines that help sort of the transit of oil something also that s really unique and interesting to look at is just tanker traffic so the tankers that carry oil around the world but again you know there are a lot of pipelines so twenty three two thousand three hundred and eighty one operational oil and gas pipelines again these are it s moving a lot of the oil that is consumed every day and then finally is this is you know one of the things that we oftentimes we think about the hundred million barrels a day that the world is consuming over 75 percent of the world s oil is controlled managed by state owned oil companies so saudi aramco being one pdvsa of venezuela being another but it s really important to sort of recognize the position that state owned companies have the rest is controlled or managed by international oil companies exxonmobil chevron eni total and a host of other host of other companies but again i think the you know to understand that nocs as they re referred to are very very important for understanding their role in the larger context of the geopolitics of oil and again what we saw last week coming out of opec this decision this is also being driven by state budget concerns this is again it s about the production of oil but it s also about you know governments and their budgets and oftentimes you know there is a desire to add more rather than you know more revenues rather than less so those are the slides that i have and i hope that they sort of provide some sort of context and a little bit of you know that we can discuss in the questions that i really look forward to answering from the audience faskianos thank you carolyn that was great so now we re going to go to all of you for your questions and comments gives queuing instructions all right so i m going to go to the first raised hand in the thing amadine hom go to you first and please accept the unmute yourself pause you are still muted pause ok i don t know are you there oh i think ok let s go to morton holbrook q yes good afternoon dr kissane what a shocking presentation laughs a hundred million barrels a day and it s going up notwithstanding the paris climate agreement of 2015 is that agreement simply a dead letter or is it having any effect on oil on fossil fuel production particularly oil production or what s the best scenario in terms of reducing dependence on fossil fuels considering the oil market thank you kissane well hi morton thank you so much for that excellent question yeah that s kind of why i emphasize that number is because a lot of people sort of just aren t aware of how much oil we continue to consume and again what the demand expectations are moving forward and these demand expectations are you know coming out of forecasts from the international energy agency so i think there s a big question as to when we see peak demand and you know if you look at bp scenarios they expect peak demand to happen you know before 2030 where as you know others kind of contest that they that they think that peak demand won t happen until after 2030 i mean again a lot depends on you know what we are now experiencing in the energy transition and how sort of quickly are we can we transition away from oil i think what s really critical when we re looking at oil is oftentimes we think only about the transportation sector so we re thinking about cars we re thinking about planes you know we re thinking about trucks and tankers and all these things but it s petrochemicals you know there s just a lot of oil that also goes into fertilizer so it really is across our economy and across economies across the global system one of the things that i always tell my students is even during covid where you had many countries right much of the world was experiencing some level of lockdown we did have a reduction in oil demand but it wasn t it wasn t like 20 million barrels it was under ten so the fact that now it s 2023 the world has reopened it s really hard to sort of see or to know with certainty is when we re going to see that see that reduction in demand now i think with the paris agreement what s also important is to note is you know if you re if you re in the oil and gas space and i was just at a conference earlier this morning where this was a point of conversation was you know what are the companies doing to reduce the emissions from production so how are they integrating carbon capture sequestration you know how are they managing the emissions that come from the production of fossil energy in this case that we re talking about oil and i think one of the things that i think if you sort of follow oil markets or a country like saudi arabia they are marketing low emission oil now we could you know we could sort of challenge well what does that you know what does that really mean but you are having you know countries that are now sort of competing to state that they have lower emitting carbon in the production in the production of oil and that s a whole other interesting sort of thing to look at in the context of the geopolitics of oil is to kind of understand the variation across emissions across different countries in the production of oil so we are you know again we are going to be going into cop 28 this fall again we are not seeing you know and we haven t seen a you know reduction in fossil energy demand again lots of people are sort of you know hoping that we ll start to see it sooner rather than later but for the time being and again you know to irina s first question that you know the last fourteen months and with you know with russia s invasion of ukraine it has both shown us that you know europe is sort of seeking to hasten the energy transition by building out more renewable energy and creating more opportunities to buy electric vehicles but there s still big swaths of the world that you know are still and have yet to move towards you know really reducing and that are actually going to see higher demand moving forward as their economies grow faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from jovana vujanic who is a graduate student at lewis university how big of an of an impact will the decision of the saudi energy minister to cut oil production have on the relationship between the united states and saudi arabia kissane love the question thank you so much yeah no it s a great one so my take is that of course this decision came as a bit of a surprise and it wasn t something that the united states you know wanted but i would say that the u s saudi relationship has been very tense for the last ten years and as part of that there are lots of different reasons for that but this is yet kind of another thing that saudi has done and again i think it s also saudi has taken a non alignment policy with relation to its position on russia and ukraine so it continues to you know it continues to have a relationship with russia it also has the relationship with ukraine as we saw you know china just brokered a very significant deal between saudi arabia and iran you know again saudi arabia and iran are two are two important producers for china so china is a large importer of oil so if you go back to world war the end of world war ii that s when the united states established the oil for security relationship with saudi arabia and as we have grown sort of more i wouldn t say independent but our as our own oil production has increased especially through the shale revolution our dependence on the middle east and saudi arabia more specifically has shifted so i think we re seeing a very different saudi arabia today which i think is going to be a challenge for the united states i think it s going to be very interesting to see what the summer holds last summer the biden administration did tap into the u s strategic petroleum reserves the largest the largest take in the history of the reserves which started in 1975 you know taking 180 million barrels out you know not because there was massive supply disruptions but because you know as the administration said it was you know it was it was it was a war it was a war specific decision because the you know russia s invasion of ukraine was causing energy prices to skyrocket and to cushion the american consumer and to better cushion the sort of the global economy the united states withdrew from the spr so i think the summer is going to be very interesting but i think we re going to see definitely much more attention in the years to come between the united states and saudi arabia it s not the relationship of the past this is a kind of a very new relationship that s a great question faskianos thank you thank you let s go curran flynn who has a raised hand q hello faskianos we can hear you but we re getting feedback so you might have two devices open q can you hear me now faskianos yes q that s better ok faskianos that s better thank you thank you so much q so i m here at king fahd university in saudi arabia right next to aramco here with my class from international relations and one of my students has a question nasser al nasir ph here he is q so thank you mrs carolyn my question is how could russia s use of alternative transportation methods such as the east siberian pipeline to china impact the u s market the domestic market and the role of the spr given potential insurance workarounds from russia s side such as ensuring russian tankers through their rdif fund and thank you to mrs irina kissane thank you and dr flynn thank you so much for having your students join this webinar so i m a little so the question is about the east siberian pipeline just could you would you mind repeating it i just want to make sure i have it i m clear on the question q so how could russia s use of alternative transportation methods such as the east siberian pipeline to china impact the u s energy markets i mean domestically and the spr given potential insurance workarounds from russia s side such as ensuring russian tankers to the rdif fund kissane yeah and that s a great question you know i think that you know begs a lot of things that we could be looking at right in terms of you know russia s kind of ability or capacity to sort of work around or find workarounds to the sanctions that were imposed and i think we ve seen sort of new markets so this kind of reshaping of the energy map with oil we see that as kind of in technicolor right whereas you know a lot of russian oil would go west is now going east you know china india being takers and of course you know other countries as well you know what will be its impact on the on the u s market i think that s you know again i do think the sanctions were sort of carefully put into place so that there wouldn t be massive disruptions so we again you know russia produces over 10 million barrels a day and about 7 million of those barrels are exported so you know if we lost all of that that would be a you know that would cause some very significant economic disruption globally we already saw you know impacts to sort of grains grain exports and food security in many different parts of the world so you know russia is finding different ways you have shadow tankers that russia is using to move to move its oil as you pointed out the east siberian pipeline you know i think there s only so much the united states can do or and european countries that are part of the sanctions regime can do to curtail russian exports of oil but i think that you know i think russia again has a has a desire and also you know revenue needs they re funding a very expensive war that they re finding ways to get their to get their oil out i think an interesting question is you know what does this mean in the years ahead the lack of investment for example that s going into russian energy infrastructure a lack of sort of any kind of western investment that is that is going in and what that is going to mean but again you know i think to your question i think we will see some you know we are seeing some impacts right there s a big question as to what you know what the next six months to a year will look like with regards to the reduction from opec and if we were to see a deeper curtailment on russian oil and you know would the united states then tap more into the spr we re now at you know we re down to seven hundred thousand barrels which of course is not insignificant but we also sort of have to be you know judicious about how we use the spr but thank you for the question faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from michael let s see trevett a ph d candidate at the university of southern mississippi china and other countries claim there are petroleum reserves under the south china sea what are your estimates of the potential amount there and has china begun to extract any of this oil kissane michael thank you so much that s a great question so china already is an oil producing country so you do have oil production in china in the south china sea i can t i can t say exactly i know that there have been geological tests that have shown the reserves again you do have you know you do have territorial concerns about sort of where is this you know can china can china tap those or seek to explore and tap those reserves again if there are if there is contention over the territory in which these reserves are located so you know china again one of the things that s very interesting about china is that china is an oil producer but china has seen over the last you know the last decade they have seen that they have experienced peak demand so i mean sorry peak supply so they are not producing as much as they used to and so you re seeing a year on year reduction in the producing capacity you know if you go back maybe five or six years ago there was lots of questions about if china could kind of replicate what happened in the united states around the shale oil revolution i think one of the big challenges for china is that of the you know where the shale reserves are located it s not near water lots of questions as to and some of it basically some of the tests have shown that it s it definitely is proving harder that you know they cannot sort of model the same level of development that we have seen in the united states so yeah no i think in the south china sea again i think we it s potentially possible that we might see it i wouldn t i wouldn t i wouldn t say it s soon faskianos thank you i m taking the next question from rob warren at the anglo american university of prague this question also got an upvote how do you foresee venezuela s role in the global oil market changing moving forward and can it be reintegrated into the global economy kissane oh these are all fantastic questions thank you all so much yeah venezuela is again you know venezuela has they have the largest reserves in the world as part of this webinar right you cfr had a kind of a primer on venezuelan and kind of you know you look at sort of where venezuela is and one of the biggest challenges confronting venezuela is both its politics but it s also it basically you know you don t have you don t have international oil service providers in the country i think the only the only one now that the u s the u s has sort of given a sanctions exemption to is that of chevron but i think yeah i mean if you were to see you know kind of shifts in the political regime and you were to see more openness then i think you could imagine you know venezuela having an opportunity or a pathway forward to be more integrated into the global energy system and the global oil system you know i think one of the big problems that venezuela faces is that most of its infrastructure is really old at this point and it would need a significant amount of reinvestment to get it up to a place that it could sort of meet its potential so you know venezuela is one of these countries that s not producing as much as it could right it has the potential to be producing 2 million plus more barrels per day but you know we ve seen that they really have just they went into freefall so i think that s a big issue and another big issue which god it goes back to an earlier question is that of emissions so the oil that comes out of venezuela is a very very heavy oil so it s it has very large carbon emissions associated with the production of that oil so that i think is again as we you know think about the emissions from oil production in countries that are sort of seeking to kind of market themselves as low emission producers you know venezuela definitely will have a very hard time recouping its where its oil sector was again it has the capacity it has the reserves but getting that getting that oil out of the ground right now you have a lot of significant above ground risks faskianos thank you i m going to go next to clemente abrokwaa raised hand so please unmute yourself q can you hear me please faskianos yes we can q thank you thank you so much for your for your talk i was also very shocked about the amount of barrels that we consume every day laughs i didn t know that but anyway i m from penn state university and my question is you just mentioned about the above ground you know effects and so the movement towards like electric vehicles and so on how do you think it is going to affect the african continent kissane thank you q i am i m thinking you know the economies and then infrastructure it will be very difficult for them to laughs move with the rest of the world in terms of electric vehicles and so on i just wanted your take on that kissane thank you clemente it s an excellent question yeah i mean you have countries across the african continent that not only have oil reserves but are already producing right nigeria is a is an oil producing country also has more capacity but again you have some above ground risks you also have the need for investment of new infrastructure i think one of the things that has been very interesting and i think it s getting it s getting more attention as it deserves is how western governments are some of i think a challenge across africa is that a lot of western governments have sort of said listen we re not going to invest in fossil fuels or also financial institutions western financial institutions we re not going to invest in fossil fuels or new projects that are fossil based and that you know that s problematic when you look across the african continent where you still don t have you know 100 percent energy access you know the idea of the transition to electric vehicles which is taking a very very long time even here across the across developed economies so the need for the infusion of more capital to go into you know across the continent of africa for oil and gas that s for their economies and for their own economic growth i think is really really pivotal and i think this is something that you know is being discussed across multilateral financial institutions and also you know is it hypocrisy right for western banks that have you know kind of funded the oil and gas industry or helped to fund the oil and gas industry in the united states and many different parts of the world and that are now sort of not allowing those funds to flow to africa and they have the again they have the they have the resources so you know is it you know the equity of some of these decisions that are being made i think is one that s is one that s really important and again i you know i said earlier in this talk is that you know all most of the demand for oil is not coming from north america and from europe all of the demand that we re seeing and new demand that we re going to see is coming from asia and is going to come from africa so again you know how are we going to make sure that that demand is met again going back to that idea of energy security so there is there is accessibility so there is reliable sources of energy at affordable prices you know without sort of thinking about kind of a whole of energy approach so i think it s very it s a very complex issue and i think you know western banks who have sort of taken very sharp positions on what they will and will not fund when it comes to new oil and gas projects are getting sort of challenged as to you know what does that mean then for you know countries across africa that are still very much in need of more energy not less and again recognizing that you know evs that again are still are you know we re seeing adoption here in the united states and across europe but it s a big big big adoption in china but it s very uneven so how do we ensure greater energy security for the continent of africa i think is a really critical question faskianos thank you i ll take the next question from kyle bales who is a senior at lewis university in romeoville illinois how is the war between russia and ukraine having an effect on the progress of the european green deal maybe you can tell us what the european define the european green deal for us carolyn give us the context for that kissane yes so again this is another fantastic question yeah the european green deal it s this is this is great yeah i mean a lot of people would say that the european green deal now is that the russia s invasion of ukraine has sort of said hey this is why the green deal is so important this is why we really need to more quickly transition to renewable energy because look what look what happened when we were dependent on russia for over 30 percent of our natural gas and look when russia you know illegally invades ukraine and suddenly weaponizes gas we are left very energy insecure it affects it affects consumers it affects industry across the continent so i think we re seeing not just through the green deal but we re also seeing through sort of european green industrial policy so in some ways akin to what you know we put into effect in this past summer is the inflation reduction act and we re seeing almost kind of this industrial competition around clean energy technologies and so europe is investing you know i think it s about 250 billion the united states it s about 370 billion towards the kind of the energy transition and helping to support domestic industries and companies to you know to be able to you know develop the technologies and to have the you know the opportunity to contribute to the energy transition so i think one thing though whenever i talk about europe it s really important is to sort of recognize that you know when you look across europe you have very different policies and kind of approaches to sort of thinking about energy and how quickly some countries want to transition and can transition whereas others you know are probably going to experience a slower transition so just really interesting example as you talked about the green deal is the eu taxonomy the green taxonomy that went into effect in the january of 2022 and there you had like really a lot of contention between france and germany because france wanted to make sure that nuclear was part of the green taxonomy germany was opposed right but germany wanted to make sure natural gas was part of the green taxonomy so ultimately in the end both natural gas and nuclear and again this was this predated russia s invasion of ukraine but in the eu green taxonomy you have you know you have both nuclear and natural gas in addition to other renewable energies that can make up this taxonomy that includes specific measures towards adaptation and mitigation for climate change so you know i think you re seeing this kind of some people call it a race a competition you know ideally it s you know we re kind of working together to because we re all sort of going in the same direction to you know support the transition and to reduce to reduce carbon emissions and to bring in more sort of cleaner energy technologies into our system faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from dr laeed zaghlami q yes good afternoon this is laeed good afternoon irina good afternoon carolyn i m very pleased to be part of your program just to want to be back to africa and particularly to nigeria how practical the two projects that nigeria is advocating for pipelines one from through algeria and the other one to morocco through western african countries how practical are these pipelines to supply gas to europe and parts of some african countries faskianos and dr zaghlami you are at algiers university correct q indeed irina yes i am professor at university of algiers faculty of information and communication faskianos thank you kissane dr laeed can i can i keep you on for just one second can i ask you what is the what is the status right now is it it s planned under construction where is what is the status of those two pipelines my understanding is that it s they re proposed but q yes well actually in practically the pipeline between algeria and abuja which means through niger and so forth is already in progress whereas the other project through thirteen western african countries they are supposed to be implemented by 2047 but is it is there any political game or something of strategic inaudible how practical how logical how efficiently will be for nigeria to have two similar project s kissane yeah no it s again thank you for the question you know pipelines again that s why i wanted to show the laughs kind of the map of pipelines is because you know a lot of pipelines transverse you know multiple countries right and this is this requires not just you know a lot of cooperation but it requires technically it also can be very complex to build to build pipelines and when you re talking about something like as you as you point out these are you know crossing many countries you know i think one of the again one of the issues is whether or not since you know what already is under construction i think you can you know with confidence that one will be completed anything that s not yet under construction and again the timeline 2047 is way out there a lot of a lot of uncertainty as to what the status of those projects will be moving forward for various reasons in terms of making sure that the investments are there someone i know that studies pipelines he says you know until the steel is in the ground you don t have the pipeline and so until you know that you ve got that you know you ve got all the oks and you feel that kind of security of being able to build it and being able to provide the resources to supply it and to move it i think algeria has been a really interesting case that hasn t gotten enough attention in terms of algerian gas that has that has helped support europe over the last years we ve seen an increase in algerian gas going into europe again a lot of attention on u s lng and the increase of liquefied natural gas exports into europe but also algeria has been you know very important for helping to support european energy security and make up for some of the losses of the of the russian gas and i think we ll see more attention on algeria and algeria s role as a you know as an important source of energy especially you know gas going into going into europe moving forward faskianos so i ll take the next written question from vincent brooks who is at harvard and diamondback energy board of directors how do you view the purchasing of discounted russian oil by india in particular relative to the purchasing by china how are they using the oil purchased and are you seeing more internal usage or external profit making sales in places like africa and what are the implications of all of this kissane right great great question so all of the above laughs in some ways right there is definitely sort of profits that are being made you know i was i was talking about this last week with someone and you know if you sort of put your shoe put yourself in the shoes of india right so india is a is a rapidly growing economy 1 4 billion you know if you had if you have very high energy inflation and high oil prices that s going to have ripples effects across the indian economy and so you know when you have a kind of opportunity to buy you know pretty steep discounted oil which you know they had been able to buy from russia you know for purposes of national security they ve been buying the oil and one of the things that s very interesting about india is that actually india has been building out its refining capacity so a lot of that oil is both for domestic and some of it is being sort of re exported but i think what we ve seen is that they re using that oil to also sort of enhance their capacity and capabilities as a rapidly emerging refining power in asia and we see that in some ways in china too so china even though oil demand was down in 2022 much of the oil that they were buying from russia went into its strategic supplies which you know they now have access to and again i think you know a big question is what we re going to see moving forward around oil demand in china wood mackenzie just published a really interesting piece kind of very bullish on the expectations for oil demand in china so whether or not they re going to continue to buy you know russian oil and again sort of taking advantage of these lower prices you know and i think i think one of the things that it s kind of an inconvenient truth whereas a lot of this oil trading used to happen in europe so european trading houses were kind of the main the main points of russian oil trade a lot of that has been moved out so you know russia has found ways to kind of bypass some of the sanctions and have set up in some cases they ve set up trading houses and some of those trading houses have been sort of set up in places that you know that they can sort of again bypass the compliance to the sanctions and you have some you have some russian oil traders that are making a lot of money laughs selling discounted oil and then reselling it a really interesting case a couple of months ago was out of malaysia malaysia announced or in the you know that they were that 1 5 million barrels were produced and sold but only malaysia doesn t produce that much so those were russian barrels that were sort of being sold under sort of the malaysian under the malaysian barrel so again i think china and india have you know have taken advantage some of this has again as i said has been re exported and some of it you know has been re exported through petroleum products because china and india you know both are building and have refining capacity faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from bhakti mirchandani at columbia university what global trajectory do you see for nuclear the russia ukraine crisis has taken some of the refining capacity offline and nuclear has the potential to change the geopolitics of energy and so what steps can be taken to foster nuclear energy kissane bhakti thank you and i was just at columbia earlier today for the center for global energy policy s conference yeah nuclear is very interesting right so when we re thinking about you know decarbonizing our energy systems you know nuclear plays a very important role because it s zero emitting so in certain parts of the world china being one saudi arabia you know you have a lot of new nuclear build you know in other parts of the world you have a lot of contention about nuclear we saw that even in germany which have you know three remaining nuclear power plants and even in the midst of massive energy crisis over the last year there was still sort of pushback about no those nuclear power plants need to be shut down whereas you would think ok in light of energy insecurity let s keep them open so you know france is an interesting country france had planned to reduce its nuclear capacity by 50 percent but this past year they pivoted and they ve said no we re actually going to build out more nuclear and we re sort of we re totally scrapping that idea of reducing nuclear energy and nuclear is very important for france s electricity system sweden has also announced that they are going to build new nuclear and they re going to increase by i think almost 50 percent again part of this is their to meet their targets of net zero we also see japan japan you know the fukushima disaster really turned japanese the japanese public off of nuclear very very deep opposition to restarting the nuclear power plants but this past year even though there s still safety concerns on the part of the public the public is also very concerned about energy insecurity and higher prices so nuclear being a domestic source of energy so i think when you look at you know net zero pathways i have not seen a net zero pathway that does not include nuclear so here in the united states the net zero america project out of princeton very important place for nuclear we just have a really hard time laughs building nuclear at cost so it s very expensive usually it s significant cost overruns and of course there is the i think they have a really significant pr problem people there s still a lot of concern about the safety of nuclear so i think to your point it s very very important for decarbonizing energy systems but you re going to see i think very disjointed approaches some countries are going are embracing nuclear and other countries are sort of doubling down on their opposition and are not going to allow nuclear to be part of the energy system faskianos we have so many questions and we are just not going to get to them all so i m going to take the next question from christian bonfili who s at torcuato di tella university in argentina so do you think carolyn that the landscape resulting from the ukraine invasion by russia vis à vis securitization of gas and energy between europe and russia could accelerate energy transition toward greener energy kissane great question i think in europe it is and i think you know many analysts would agree that the iea for example you know you had the you know how does europe continue you know to enhance and achieve energy security without the dependence on russia gas and a lot of that is through renewable energy you also have a lot of new attention on hydrogen and the role that hydrogen will play i think i think europe is being cautious and so they are not saying that they are going to completely move away from gas so as earlier questions are they getting gas from algeria or are they getting gas from norway are they getting more gas from the united states in the form of liquefied natural gas and then also an uncomfortable truth is they continue to get liquefied natural gas from russia so we ve seen an increase in lng from russia going into europe that said i think all in you are seeing that you know countries across europe are saying ok you know how can we enhance our energy security how do we build more sort of domestic energy sources solar wind we re seeing you know more rapid deployment you ve got a lot of questions about supply chains and things like that but i think overall i think the answer would be that it s quickening the energy transition faskianos so i will take the moderator prerogative to just ask the final question for you to close on and just to give us your top three what are the major challenges for the geopolitics of oil as you look out over the next five to ten year horizon that you would leave us with to be looking for kissane ok you know so i think what we saw right tensions between saudi arabia and the united states we also have a you know a hot war cold war depending on you know the term you want to use between the united states and china and lots of sort of questions as to what that s going to look like i think there s you know i think there s concern that you know we re not reducing demands but we re seeing tightening supply and so that s going to have you know very significant impacts for economies especially economies that are already very fragile economically fragile politically fragile so that concerns me a lot in terms of you know what happens when you know economies don t have adequate access to energy to make sure that their industries that their that consumers you know are able that the lights can stay on and you can get you know if you re dependent on cars you re depending on trucks like all these kinds of things are really really critical so i think we have to be very cautious moving forward that we don t take more out of the system before we have adequately set up the system to be resilient and to be able to sort of meet the energy security demands that are not are not they re not decreasing i think they are increasing and becoming even more complex so i think there s a lot of concerns and a lot of uncertainty and you know this definitely is going to be an area to watch in the years ahead faskianos carolyn kissane kissane excuse me thank you very much for shaping and sharing this discussion for sharing your terrific insights with us and to all of you for your questions and comments i m really sorry that we could not get to them all

10 things i learnt while living in a hyper inflationary country how to survive when your country hits a sextillion per cent inflation rate tendai tomu follow published in the startup 7 min read jun 27 2019 12 listen share what were you up to in 2008 in 2008 for the first time in history china hosted the summer olympics with the major highlights of this historic event being athletes and spectators falling in love with the spectacular opening ceremonies and the memorable architecture of many of its sporting venues while criticizing beijing s air pollution dmitry medvedev russia s first deputy prime minister and outgoing president vladimir putin s hand picked successor was elected in a landslide victory to become russia s next leader remember the lehman brothers bankruptcy that triggered the global recession the us stock market crashed by the end of 2008 the dow was down 34 closing at 8 816 62 and other indices performed even worse this was the year obama won the us presidency barack obama won the presidency on november 3 2008 and he promised to provide the sorely needed hope to jump start the stalled economy his proposals helped restore confidence in financial markets a year to forget for zimbabweans 2008 is the year most zimbabweans wish they could forget the now deposed despot robert mugabe was the president of zimbabwe at that time but the man who ran the show or the financial circus was the then central bank chief gideon gono he was a rather charismatic fellow who had risen from the humble position of a garden boy to his current position our financial crisis happened under his watch gono s money printing presses ran overtime in 2008 so much that the reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz literally ran out of ink and paper at that time i was a young banker fresh from school working for one of the commercial banks in zimbabwe i remember thinking to myself we have finally hit rock bottom here when we started receiving wet notes literally wet there was no time to wait for the money to properly dry after printing because of the high demand for banknotes a boy holding a load of notes as inflation peaked more zeroes were added and then chopped off it was very common to have a 10 000 000 000 000 dollar note that gets redesigned overnight and becomes a 100 dollar bill more than 23 new different dollar bills were introduced within a space of 7 years we constantly had old bills and new bills in circulation as they overlapped over each other we even went from normal banknotes to bearer cheques to try to cope with the zeros the zimdollar as the currency was known was now worthless prices of basic goods and services soared by astronomical scales imagine paying 100 billion dollars for two eggs owing to the phone company 2 654 287 527 899 on your latest monthly bill or having to buy a loaf of bread with money that you wouldn t be able to fit into your pockets it was wise for beer guzzlers to buy two beers at once because by the time you finish the first the second would otherwise cost you double the hyperinflation also meant schools shutting down because no one was paying the teachers and those who were willing to teach without pay didn t have the bus fare to get to the schools or the buses were stuck in a fuel queue somewhere it also meant no medicine in hospitals as there was no foreign currency to procure them we even ran out of clean drinking water as town municipalities ran out of water treatment chemicals and there was a severe outbreak of cholera the lessons learn to grow your own food when money is worthless food will become hyper valuable in 2008 supermarket shelves were empty and you could have the money but there was nothing to buy and when the shops did finally get supplies disappointingly long winding queues would form within minutes a truckload of sugar would be delivered at a retail price of say 500 billion dollars for each 2kg then a general dealer would grab the whole load and start selling it at double the price each connected people would buy it repack it in cups and start selling it 3 or 4 times more own your home in today s world homeownership is being continuously dismissed as terrible investment advice by some experts but in hyper inflationary environments a house is as good as gold in 2008 zimbabwe most property owners ended up demanding rentals in either usd or food groceries as inflation peaked but these demands were beyond the reach of many people the good thing about it once it happens crazy inflation will eat away any mortgages and loans you might have most people paid off their mortgages for a few dollars at that time never put your eggs in one basket this ancient saying proved true as people lost their lifelong savings as banks and insurance firms collapsed money kept in bank accounts lost value as inflation rose and even those who kept foreign accounts with the banks lost their money when the central bank resorted to raiding those accounts for foreign currency there was no real stock market wiser individuals survived by investing in property and buying physical united states dollars and keeping them in their homes zimbabwe 2008 is the main reason why i was able to embrace bitcoin and cryptocurrencies earlier than most even though i was coming from a world that i would like to believe was far from satoshi nakamoto s world i had seen how the value of fiat currencies can be eroded in the blink of an eye and i had experienced the devastating results of putting the printing press into the wrong hands gideon gono and his casino economics showed me how the world financial systems that we currently rely on are built to fail as what coincidentally happened to the 2008 us led market crash which affected nearly the whole world investments in alternative energy sources do pay off due to the scarcity of foreign currency to import electricity in order to offset our energy deficit the power authority in zimbabwe resorted to incessant power cuts blackouts could be experienced for more than 18 hours a day and this meant that production in industries ground to a halt those individuals and organisations that had made previous investments in solar power biogas etc fended better because they had access to power when the blackouts hit they could work communicate and prepare their food easily charging mobile phones seems easy when you have power but during a blackout it becomes a real hustle have an idea of how to home school your kids as schools shut down due to the economic decay most parents were stuck with their kids at home it is very important to have an idea of how to teach your kids in such instances and access teaching resources some communities teamed up to make sure that the underpaid school teachers were incentivised so that they could continue to work unencumbered learn a trade or two in any difficult environment skills that are in demand will always be worth something in trade i remember salaries being deposited today and losing 50 in value in less than 48 hours by the end of the week your salary wouldn t be enough to cover bank charges alone in such an environment it is imperative that one have a side hustle that can take them to the end of the month in 2008 zimbabwe people who were engineers economists lawyers or teachers swallowed their pride and started side hustles on the streets never forget your diaspora as a country zimbabweans in the diaspora who remitted foreign currency and goods to their families back home became the josephs that kept our country afloat those in the us and uk sent money while those nearby in south africa and botswana dispatched groceries and medicines have your travel documents ready growing up i never witnessed hordes of people leaving my country for greener pastures as i did in 2008 in the past zimbabweans favoured going into the diaspora to study and then returning home after graduation in 2008 they left for good as shop shelves became empty we also turned to our runners people who could travel to south africa to buy goods and bring them back to us for a profit young people would spend days and nights in queues at the immigration offices waiting to get their travelling papers which also became elusive for obvious reasons very few planned for a future in zimbabwe adapt or die for those of us to whom leaving was not an option it became very important to quickly move on with the fast changing times or be left behind and die to those in business time taken in decision making was a crucial determinant as to whether the business could survive or not most smes thrived during this hyper inflationary period due to their ability to quickly decide and adapt to the new conditions of the market big businesses with long bureaucratic chains of command were not so lucky at the end of the day life is all about you and your loved ones companies will shut down during hyperinflation friends will move away and fuel shortages and power cuts mean that you are cut off from the rest of the world even politicians turn to their selfish ways during such times at the end of it all you realise that family is all that you have and it s important

to maximize profit minimize debt and avoid financing woes jewelers must adapt to rising interest rates here s how the industry s top finance wonks see the current borrowing climate the cost of cash is up and jewelers need to adjust the federal open market committee of the federal reserve system determines monetary policy to regulate the economy by adjusting its benchmark federal funds rate which influences interest rates on all types of loans and borrowing for small businesses and consumers among others and while the fed has decided to adopt patience toward further rate increases through the remainder of the year it has lifted them by a quarter percent nine times in its current adjustment cycle effectively raising the fed funds rate from 0 to 2 5 percent for jewelers who haven t been vigilant that s bleeding the bottom line throughout operations from sourcing to selling people may think it s only a couple percent but interest rates have impact across everything we do says abe sherman ceo of buyers intelligence group a napa calif based jewelry consultant in an industry where net operating income is low each tick interest rates go up erodes profit if borrowing costs you a couple extra points it can erase 10 percent of the bottom line jewelers obtain financing from their lenders in the form of either revolving lines of credit or term loans both of which are frequently based on the prime rate normally set 3 percent above the fed funds rate so while an individual jeweler s interest rate depends upon the company s strength the cost of borrowing is rising across the board we have a revolving account with a fluctuating rate explains john hayes owner of goodman s jewelers in madison wis in the past two years we ve only used the line twice and there was a noticeable difference term loans can come with fixed or variable rates and vary in the life of the loan from mid to longer term but they re rising too an even bigger hit can come from a long term perspective the three to 10 year note people would take out for moving to a new location doing a renovation of their store making a capital investment or adding a substantial new line says larry rickert president of jim kryshak jewelers in wausau wis servicing that debt can easily become a larger dollar amount over a longer period of time and rates are likely to go even higher we re still at historically low levels says michael pollak founder and ceo of seven location hyde park jewelers headquartered in denver they could easily bump up even another 100 basis points over the next year or two the inventory albatross among the biggest potential pitfalls for jewelers in this new higher rate environment is overleveraging owned inventory as collateral to secure asset based financing the cost of money has an incredible impact on the carrying cost for inventory says david stone co owner of nancy and david fine jewels in millburn n j we ve gotten to where i don t want to carry the debt what we buy we pay for explains sherman when interest rates were as low as they were people used that opportunity for growth they would go to the bank show a lot of assets and the bank would ask for too much collateral all of a sudden they re over inventoried now that interest rates are going up the short term debt is getting more expensive so the excess inventory is costing the larger issue is why they re taking on debt in the first place he continues they could just borrow the money because it was cheap too often they re using it just to keep up with bills but then their credit is either tapped out or they max out at christmas the line of credit is required to be cleared up once a year but some jewelers maybe never pay it off or only for 30 days or so then it s just a lot of debt rather than actually having a line of credit when that threshold is reached businesses are further burdened by not being able to reorder fast sellers aged inventory is very hard on the bottom line hayes says if you aren t turning it that s going to hurt jewelers need to embrace a strategic approach to incurring debt they should consider converting revolving debt to fixed term say a five year term loan so they can use debt intelligently rather than suffer ongoing increasing cost of servicing the outstanding debt sherman advises then they can use debt when it makes sense to drive growth like bringing on a new line or opening a new location suppressing consumer demand rising interest rates are also likely to slow consumer demand hitting discretionary spending with the double whammy of a heightened incentive to save in tandem with increased costs for making credit purchases as interest rates go up the cost of living goes up hayes explains it costs more for people to get loans for homes and cars that reduces their spendable income and when they see an opportunity to make a little bit by not spending they re going to be more likely to start saving again and that will slow things down further stone predicts the impact will be felt mainly in the middle income sector the affluent customer is resilient they re still spending money he says but we ll probably see mainstream client traffic and sales decline just as we did with the downturn to counter these factors and generate sales rickert urges jewelers to embrace subsidized consumer financing programs such as the one the american gem society offers through wells fargo bank which extends approved customers 0 percent financing for up to a year if they make their monthly payments or 9 99 percent for a five year payoff according to rickert there are two kinds of customers those who have money in their bank accounts but like using other people s money if they can get the 0 percent and the first time engagement customers who are making a substantial purchase but don t want to pay regular credit card rates this way it s more like purchasing a vehicle profiting from a stronger dollar a silver lining to rising domestic interest rates has been a corresponding run up averaging about 10 percent in the value of the dollar versus foreign currencies this presents an opportunity to increase profit on imports while well known watch brands and other similarly large offshore suppliers tend to price their products internationally in dollars smaller manufacturers often sell in local currencies the more favorable exchange rates are making those products more affordable for jewelers paying in dollars the advantage is with smaller boutique manufacturers pollak says ninety percent of the italians are still selling in euros we just got back from vicenza which is reestablishing itself as an important show we definitely did some new sourcing the united kingdom has been especially attractive for u s buyers as the pound has undergone downward pressure stemming from brexit struggles we discovered a sterling silver line out of england and it s sold exceptionally well our turn is tremendous hayes says so we doubled down that puts us in a pretty good spot illustration by michele marconi
the ceo of america s largest consumer fireworks retailer spoke with president donald trump on chinese tariffs in a private meeting just weeks before donating 750 000 worth of fireworks for the salute to america july 4 show on the national mall the ceo of america s largest consumer fireworks retailer spoke with president donald trump on chinese tariffs in a private meeting just weeks before donating 750 000 worth of fireworks for the salute to america july 4 show on the national mall phantom fireworks boss bruce zoldan made his case to trump in a private may 22 meeting with other business executives in washington in a statement to wtop zoldan confirmed the meeting and said he did not specifically discuss fireworks or address the topic of fireworks and tariffs he added i met the president with a group of businessmen who lead a variety of industries and while tariffs were discussed in general we did not equate the conversation to a specific industry discussions about phantom and grucci s donation to this year s fourth of july performance commenced two months in advance of anything relating to tariffs zoldan noted that discussions for the july 4 donation had been going on for months fireworks companies say tariffs in the escalating trade war with china will make fireworks more expensive for consumers local and federal agencies they say their products can t be easily produced outside of china mostly due to stricter u s regulations on the volatile chemicals that go into them the president knows that fireworks are loved by his supporters and most americans on the fourth of july zoldan told bloomberg which first reported the story he also told bloomberg that the industry would lose several smaller companies and that larger businesses would be forced to fire employees as profits decline zoldan told wtop this week that there was nothing political behind the donation the phantom fireworks family and the grucci family are thrilled and honored to be a part of this i know it ll be somewhat controversial i know that there will be some media that will play this out as political he said when i said that people in my neighborhood came to watch the fireworks show at our house we were watching fireworks and everybody was not talking politics they were talking america s birthday the fourth of july and that s why we re doing this in years past july 4 celebrations in washington were handled by garden state fireworks who are still contributing to the 2019 show alongside phantom and grucci this year s fourth of july celebrations won t be hit by trump s import taxes but the pyrotechnics industry isn t the only one that wants trump to back off from chinese tariffs and economic experts have been sounding the alarm tariffs on chinese and mexican imports amount to potentially 190 billion a year in new taxes paid by u s importers and typically passed on to consumers for american households this means higher prices on fruits and vegetables autos electronic components and other necessities what s more exporters especially farmers can expect to suffer retaliation when china and mexico hit back with tariffs or other sanctions on exports from the united states the tariffs inflict other damage that is harder to measure they generate uncertainty for american businesses over where to buy supplies sell goods or situate factories and offices and they rattle investors and undercut consumer and business confidence researchers at investment bank ubs calculate that a 25 tariff on all chinese imports would shave a full percentage point from u s growth over the next year the economy grew 2 9 in 2018 and will likely be weaker for 2019 add a 25 tax on mexican goods they say and the united states could tumble into recession for the first time since 2009 the federal reserve has taken notice chairman jerome powell made clear this week that the fed is prepared intervene likely by lowering interest rates if the trade wars were deemed to threaten the expansion still it s far from sure that trump s trade conflicts even if they escalate will imperil the economy pinelopi goldberg chief economist of the world bank and economists pablo fajgelbaum of ucla patrick kennedy of the university of california berkeley and amit khandelwal of columbia university calculated that the economic loss from the trade wars last year amounted a minuscule 0 04 of gross domestic product the broadest gauge of economic output their figure doesn t include the latest tariff threats one reason is that trade accounts for a surprisingly small portion of the economy exports and imports combined equal just 27 of u s gross domestic products the world bank calculates the share is lower in only seven other countries none of them an industrial power like the u s yet despite its modest economic role trade punches above its weight in american political discourse consider the revamped version of the politically contentious north american free trade agreement that the u s negotiated last year with canada and mexico one of trump s policy achievements trump said the new pact the u s mexico canada agreement would create jobs and restore america s status as a manufacturing powerhouse by drawing factories back to the u s from low wage mexico but the independent u s international trade commission analyzed the new agreement and concluded that it would boost the economy by just 68 billion and add 176 000 jobs over six years negligible gains in a 21 trillion economy and a job market exceeding 150 million people the associated press contributed

with brent d griffiths the ticker president trump may have expected to be the star villain at the first democratic presidential debate on wednesday night instead he ran a distant second to american corporations and the wealthy as most of the candidates competed to outflank each other to the left and capture the angry populist flag the development was a surprise in a field that has divided itself into those seeking to consolidate liberal support versus those chasing the moderate mantle and it suggests corporate interests from wall street and beyond could be in for rougher ride than they expected from the democrats extended primary campaign sen elizabeth warren d mass polling well ahead of her rivals on the stage started the bidding by pushing back on a question about whether her economic plans are too bold at a time when 71 percent of americans say the economy is doing well advertisement warren said the economy is doing great for a thinner and thinner slice at the top drug companies private prison companies and oil giants when you ve got a government when you ve got an economy that does great for those with money and isn t doing great for everyone else that is corruption pure and simple she said we need to call it out we need to attack it head on and we need to make structural change in our government in our economy and in our country the answer was squarely on brand for warren but then sen amy klobuchar d minn who has staked out more moderate ground in her campaign dodged an invitation to repeat criticisms she s made previously of sweeping plans offered by warren and other liberals maybe ahem because she read wednesday s ticker about the risks of attacking last night s frontrunner i do get concerned about paying for college for rich kids she said of a proposal to entirely eliminate student debt and she summed up with another shot at the ultra wealthy if billionaires can pay off their yachts students should be able to pay off their student loans sen cory booker d n j similarly ducked an opportunity to draw a distinction with warren asked why he disagrees with warren s call to break up big tech companies like facebook amazon and google as he has said policymakers shouldn t be running around pointing at companies and breaking them up without any kind of process booker said he doesn t in fact disagree with his colleague from massachusetts i think we have a serious problem in our country with corporate consolidation he said i see every single day that this economy is not working for average americans the indicators that are being used from gdp to wall street s rankings is not helping people in my community advertisement booker name checked halliburton and amazon as companies that pay nothing in taxes and said that needs to change amazon ceo jeff bezos also owns the post and he said he would beef up antitrust enforcement by appointing judges who would make it a priority and ensure his justice department and federal trade commission focus on it too on taxes former texas rep beto o rourke declined to say whether he would support a top marginal rate of 70 percent for those making more than 10 million a year a proposal championed by rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y but he blasted a system that favors those who can pay for access and outcomes that s how you explain an economy that is rigged to corporations and to the very wealthiest he said he favors taxing capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income and would raise the corporate tax rate to 28 percent that would hike it from its current rate of 21 percent to the level president obama proposed in 2012 when the rate was 35 percent advertisement chiming in from the far left edge of the stage and angling to claim the far left mantle in the debate new york city mayor bill deblasio endorsed all of the most liberal policy prescriptions that had been invoked yes we re supposed to be for a 70 percent tax rate on the wealthy he said yes we re supposed to be for free college free public college for our young people we are supposed to break up big corporations when they re not serving our democracy he called the questions central to a battle for the heart and soul of our party later on deblasio had a ready replacement for the immigrants that trump won office in part by demonizing to economically dislocated voters for all the american citizens out there who fear you re falling behind the immigrants didn t do that to you he said the corporations did that to you the 1 percent did that to you trump tracker trade fly

has for more than a year sought to weed out the practice known as transshipment in which chinese exports typically are minimally processed or altered during a brief stop in a third port and then re exported as a product originating from the third port such circumvention threatens to crimp u s plans as it prepares to add tariffs on to 300 billion of chinese exports from toys to electronics
