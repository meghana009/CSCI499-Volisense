america s tariffs against china are already showing signs of undermining the global economy and will create a funding crisis for the federal government when it leads to foreigners no longer buying us treasury debt and selling down their existing dollar holdings a subversive attempt by america to divert global portfolio investment from china by destabilising hong kong will force china into a plan b to fund its infrastructure plans which could involve actively selling down her dollar reserves and hastening the introduction of a new crypto based trade settlement currency the us budget deficit will then be financed entirely by monetary inflation furthermore the turn of the credit cycle made more destructive by trade tariffs is driving the global and us economy into a slump further accelerating all indebted governments dependency on inflationary financing the end result is america s trade policies have been instrumental in hastening the end of the dollar as the world s reserve currency ultimately leading to its destruction introduction for almost two years president trump has imposed various tariffs on imported chinese goods he advertised his tactics as hardball from a tough president who knows the art of the deal taking his business acumen and applying it to foreign affairs he even proudly described himself as a tariff man the real crash americ peter schiff buy new 23 95 as of 05 55 utc details his opening gambit was to impose tariffs on some goods to get leverage over the chinese with the threat that if they didn t cooperate then further tariffs would be introduced the chinese declined to be cowed by threats introducing tariffs themselves on us imports particularly agricultural products to bring pressure to bear in turn on president trump egged on by his trade adviser peter navarro and commerce secretary wilbur ross trump has continued to intensify his tariff policies oblivious to the damage being done to the global economy putting aside panglossian statistics both america and china are now heading for a recession that is increasingly likely to deepen significantly america s consumer driven economy is yet to reflect much of a slow down though producer countries dependent on either or both economies such as germany are already descending into a manufacturing slump china s gdp is registering a growth rate of about 6 low by chinese standards but being no more than a money total this is just a reflection of the quantity of money still being pumped into the chinese economy by the authorities as the world descends into an economic contraction it will not be reflected in government statistics because all economies are having increasing quantities of fiat money pumped into them financial market participants naively believe that changes in gdp indicate an economy s condition if that was the case the german economy in 1918 23 was an economic miracle and not the disaster history has led us to believe the impoverishment of the masses just like today s reported impoverishment of venezuelans and zimbabweans must have been misreported because nominal gdp was increasing ten or a hundredfold then there is the deflator ah the deflator a concoction by statisticians who appear to be under a government cosh to keep it as low as possible that s easy to deal with introduce price controls across the board and use those official prices as a basis for the cpi infinite gdp growth is then assured that is the ultimate logic of perennial bulls and the errors should be obvious at some stage market participants beholden to the system will awaken to the lie that gdp nominal or adjusted has any statistical value even in respectable jurisdictions banks will be rescued and unemployment will rise but gdp will continue to inflate sorry grow the effect on prices so far has been subdued at least if you believe the official cpi version tariffs will end up blowing a hole in inflation targets while the global economy slumps and borrowing costs will then rise inexorably it s time to discover why the america china financial war and trade war will end up undermining the dollar us s deep state strategy is stuck in the cold war era besides president trump s policy on tariffs the permanent staff in the intelligence and military complexes are the driving force behind cold war 2 against china and russia russia has been in their sights since yalta control of the middle east along with libya and afghanistan have been key objectives the western alliance comprising the us and its european handmaidens has been focusing on oil but at its root is the justification of us military spending us taxpayers have been told that the middle east north africa and more recently the ukraine are important to stop russia either dominating global energy supplies or pursuing territorial ambitions russia s military power is not as strong as projected by us military propagandists it has excellent nuclear capability but an underequipped out of date military who can forget the sight of russia s one aircraft carrier the admiral kuznetsov chugging from the baltic to the mediterranean to come to syria s aid breaking down and emitting clouds of black smoke needing tugs to nurse it along it is the naval equivalent of the ghastly trabant motor car of the 1980s the most egregious example of russia s non nuclear might perhaps but indicative nonetheless the same is broadly true of russia s army its capability is limited and american battle failures in the field are their own russia does not even try to punch above its weight choosing to dance round the ring and tire out its opponent that way despite its superior equipment and battlefield technology america usually then succumbs to its own errors as an adversary china is in a different league to russia altogether at least america s military complex knows not to take china on instead more subversive tactics are deployed and this is why hong kong has become the pressure point against china destroying the investment link for international funds investing in chinese infrastructure projects logically america should have accommodated china long ago recognizing the dollar s role as the supreme fiat currency would not then be challenged but that would have led to the entire military complex being downsized over time peace is not good for the war business without doubt it would have been economically beneficial for everyone other than the military american corporations were happily running manufacturing operations in china and south east asia as high quality processors in their supply chains trump s simple world where china steals american jobs was never the case us government s developing funding crisis the statistics in table 1 summarise america s financial problem these figures tell us that since the turn of the millennium 94 of america s accumulated budget deficit is covered by the accumulated balance of payments deficit in other words almost all the budget deficit is financed directly or indirectly by inward capital flows and very little can be attributed to genuine demand for us treasuries by america s savers this result is to be expected since it reflects an accounting identity at the national level the accounting identity tells us that unless there is an increase in national savings a budget deficit will be financed by capital arising from the trade deficit we can also say the money to cover the budget deficit in the absence of capital inflows and an increase in savings can only be through monetary inflation in other words through the debasement of the currency substituting for genuine savings how an economy grows a schiff andrew j best price 1 99 buy new 7 20 as of 11 05 utc details in practice foreign owned dollars do not all go into us treasuries and investment outflows must be taken into account as well since 2000 according to treasury tic figures these are approximately 9 trillion while total investment inflows at about 16 trillion leaves us with net inflows of 7 trillion implying that foreign owned cash and deposits in the us banks will have expanded to fill the gap between investment flows and the total balance of payments deficit and indeed we find that these balances amount to 4 3 trillion accounting almost entirely for the gap between net inflows and the accumulated budget deficit in table 1 obviously there are other flows involved but they are not material to the point in the absence of an increase in savings a budget deficit will always lead to a balance of payments deficit how it is covered by a combination of net inward capital flows and monetary inflation is a separate but important consideration to which we will return later now that the us faces a recession the budget deficit will rise due to lower than forecast tax receipts and higher than expected welfare costs the deeper the recession the greater the deficit which before the recessionary effect is factored in was forecast by the congressional budget office to be just over one trillion dollars for the current fiscal year which is two months in it will obviously be somewhat higher requiring funding by a combination of inward capital flows and monetary expansion if the foreigners don t play ball funding the budget deficit will be entirely down to monetary inflation worse if they reduce their dollar holdings not only will monetary expansion have to make up the funding difference for the government but it will also have to address net foreign sales of existing treasuries and other us dollar assets as well at end june 2018 the total value of those assets including those held before 2000 were recorded at 19 4 trillion plus bank deposits and short term assets of 4 3bn taking the total to 23 7 trillion this is the same approximate size as the us government s total debt and slightly more than us gdp will foreigners sell us assets naturally dollar based capital markets believe in the dollar and its hegemonic status this extends to a belief that foreigners in financial trouble will always demand dollars and the more their trouble the greater their demand for dollars is likely to be it is a mantra that ignores the fact that foreigners are up to their eyes in dollars already look at it from china s point of view the bulk of her foreign reserves of 3 1 trillion are in dollars with about one third of it in us government debt she is helping america to finance its military which aims to contain and crush china it s rather like giving the school bully your baseball bat and inviting him to hit you with it furthermore china s military strategists have their own view of how america uses her currency s hegemonic status and it is not a casual one they know or think they know why america has stirred up hong kong and that is to prevent global portfolio flows being invested in china because america is desperate to have them instead it leaves china with a serious problem she had expected inward global portfolio flows to help finance her infrastructure projects and the americans have effectively succeeded in closing down the hong kong shanghai connect link through which foreign investment was to be directed she is now in a position whereby she may have no alternative but to put her plans on hold or use her own dollar reserves to that end besides her us treasury holdings she is likely to have a further trillion or so in short term instruments and bank deposits to draw on a decision to actively reduce her holdings of us treasuries would not be taken lightly by china the response from america would likely be an intensification of the financial war perhaps including an emergency power to stop china selling her treasury stock if that happened china would have no option but to respond and a dollar crisis would almost certainly ensue while outcomes with a rational opponent are theoretically predictable president trump s actions and how they mesh with the deep state are less so making the consequences of any action taken by china deeply unpredictable we shall have to wait to see how this next stage plays out meanwhile the inflationary outlook in america is already deteriorating fmq confirms a reacceleration of monetary inflation after pausing in its headlong growth since the lehman crisis the fiat money quantity surged into record territory at 15 812bn at the beginning of october figure 1 fmq is the sum of austrian true money supply and bank reserves held at the fed the reason for its renewed growth is the fed s easing by injecting money into the system through its repurchase agreements fmq for the beginning of november is likely to be higher still something is amiss systemically which appears to require continual monetary injections to prevent a financial crisis the us economy having been already flooded with money following lehman this development is deeply worrying and possibly marks a countdown to the next credit crisis price inflation will get out of control to independent analysts it should be clear by now that the world is probably teetering on the edge of a cyclical credit crisis which this time is coupled with the destructive synergy of trade tariffs equally it is obvious that while central bankers and politicians suspect something is wrong they are clueless about the forces involved otherwise they would not have implemented monetary policies that led to the situation today in the short term as we saw with the lehman crisis when a credit crisis hits there will probably be a panic into safety but for the eventual outcome we must look beyond any initial effect america and its dollar are central to how events will evolve as already shown in this article the dollar is over owned by foreigners relative to ownership of foreign currencies by americans the basis of both categories of ownership is commercial assumptions about current and future prospects for international trade for this reason a slump will cause demand for all currencies to contract which in the dollar s case will need to net selling greater than any repatriation of capital from abroad even though most dollars are actually held by foreign governments and their agencies their strategic reserve decisions are ultimately driven by economic factors assuming the global economic slump deepens over the next few years at a time when the american budget deficit will be increasing rapidly foreigners will be sellers of dollars and underlying us assets including us treasuries unless private sector actors in america increase their propensity to save the budget deficit will have to be financed instead entirely by inflationary means broadly other than intertemporal factors there are two ways in which monetary inflation can translate into higher prices a relative desire to reduce possession of the currency relative to goods either by domestic users or by foreigners the two preceding paragraphs describe why foreigners are likely to turn sellers for reasons of trade to which we can add the further consideration that over the last year a combination of a rising dollar and falling us treasury yields have been immensely profitable for them an experience which might not be repeated next year so while domestic users may be slow to see the dollar s purchasing power accelerate in its decline the push to a weakening dollar is likely to come from abroad at least initially all holders of dollars will find that their ownership of dollars relative to goods will be increasing rapidly due to inflationary financing to cover a rising budget deficit instead of consumers and other economic actors associated with main street the banks owe the bulk of their balances and deposits to other financial entities and foreigners therefore the domestic monetary system is potentially more footloose than in the past the risk to the fed is that this deposit cohort is more likely to take its cue from factors such as the foreign exchanges the price of gold and even cryptocurrencies speeding up the fall in the dollar s purchasing power once it begins to slide it is a long time since we have seen it but when the smart money begins to view things negatively everything the fed does with monetary policy or the executive does fiscally leads to failure a falling dollar leads to rising interest rates in the markets and the government s funding crisis will be laid bare for all to see and with the fed and the us treasury staffed with neo keynesians a policy reversal to stabilise the currency by making it sound will be the last thing that happens crash proof 2 0 how t peter d schiff best price 1 50 buy new 3 97 as of 10 46 utc details a world driven to trade isolationism american trade policy under president trump is isolationist and at odds with the role of a reserve currency his mantra of make america great again and his determination to build a wall on the mexican border are testament to his thinking if anything america s introspection towards russia and china has strengthened their partnership as joint asian hegemons their decision to progress their economies without america and its dollars was taken by america for them russia has already turned most of her dollars into gold and continues to do so china s plans to evolve her economy into a more consumer oriented one are underway but she is still too dependent on export oriented trade to disregard ties with her western trading partners consequently china can be expected to accelerate plans for her vision of a consumer driven middle class in order to do so she will dispose of the dollar for trade purposes as much as possible at the meeting of the brics nations in brazil earlier this month a common cryptocurrency was discussed ostensibly to reduce currency volatility but in reality to eliminate the dollar as a common settlement medium between brics members so far china has seen the redundancy of the dollar as a gradual evolutionary process but america s policy of diverting global portfolio flows from china is likely to lead to china drawing down on her foreign reserves particularly her holdings of us dollars to replace expected capital inflows she will still be dependent on imports of raw materials for which some dollars will be needed but so long as she has a trade surplus and she insists on her preferences for trade settlement by other means china s dollar requirements will be minimised china can probably weather the political consequences of a collapse in international trade because for the population american aggression is clearly to blame while china has had to amend its plans and is resisting precipitative action there can be no doubt her determination to do away with the dollar is more urgent together with russia the other brics members and the shanghai cooperation organisation as well as her trade counterparties in sub saharan africa china s policies for trade settlement without the dollar will affect more than half the world s population and when you get establishment figures in the western banking system such as mark carney openly speculating at jackson hole last august about a

briefing highlights what to expect from boc stocks canadian dollar oil at a glance what global pmis show husky scales back spending plans u s retailers in record black friday haul what analysts are saying today required reading boc expected to hold about 40 central banks worldwide have eased up this year but the bank of canada isn t one of them and isn t expected to join them this week the boc is very likely to again leave rates unchanged at its meeting on wednesday as still solid domestic fundamentals and at target inflation are balanced against remaining global downside risks said veronica clark associate u s economics at citigroup the central bank is worried about the global economic backdrop specifically the uncertainty sparked by the trump administration s trade policy and its tariff war with china some economists believe governor stephen poloz senior deputy governor carolyn wilkins and their colleagues may yet trim the bank s benchmark overnight rate from its current 1 75 per cent as insurance against those global issues but not this week there s just too much on the con side of the pros and cons to stop the bank of canada from marching to its own drummer first friday s report on third quarter gross domestic product was lame but highlighted some strong points notably a hefty pickup in business investment while some 40 central banks having eased monetary policy this year we continue to think the boc will remain an outsider by holding rates steady week royal bank of canada senior economists nathan janzen and josh nye said in a lookahead to the decision that view was cemented by gdp report which showed a 1 3 per cent annualized increase in q3 that was bang on the boc s forecast from october they added that s a disappointing pace of growth regardless of expectations but the details were actually slightly firmer than we thought business investment posted a surprising increase marking just the second gain in the last six quarters there s an interesting side point here as well as statistics canada also revised some earlier quarters of gdp readings higher material revisions left canada s growth rate tracking 1 7 per cent over the past year much closer to the bank of canada s estimate of potential than anticipated said cibc world markets senior economist royce mendes so while the headline q3 growth rate isn t anything to write home about the revisions coupled with strength in q3 final domestic demand growth do reinforce the bank of canada s current stand pat view on rates cibc chief economist avery shenfeld also pointed out that it will take some sour reports on the jobs market for the central bank to act soon we ll need to see a climb in the jobless rate over the next two surveys to maintain our projection for a q1 quarter point ease mr shenfeld said referring to cibc s forecast that the central bank will trim the overnight rate by one quarter of a percentage point early next year open this photo in gallery bank of canada senior deputy governor carolyn wilkins and governor stephen polozadrian wyld the canadian press one of those sour jobs reports could come friday when statistics canada releases its november look at the labour market but it s difficult to forecast what these reports will show indeed bank of montreal expects to see that canada created 10 000 jobs last month as unemployment held at 5 5 per cent cibc in turn forecasts a loss of 9 000 positions with the jobless rate rising to 5 7 per cent also at play are a number of smaller factors telling the bank to hold tight said bmo senior economist robert kavcic first housing activity has rebounded smartly in b c and ontario as the plunge in longer term bond yields this year has done much of the work for the bank he added at the same time mortgage credit growth has accelerated again at just over 4 per cent it s not flashing warning signs but the turnaround has reduced the impetus to ease another of those smaller factors is fiscal policy and markets will learn more on thursday in the new liberal minority government s throne speech fiscal policy is poised to add more to growth with the federal budget deficit possibly jumping toward 30 billion in from 19 8 billion this year the throne speech on dec 5 will be the first confidence test and give a good indication of policy measures ahead mr kavcic said economists also don t expect much change in the central bank s statement wednesday and if the market misinterprets anything deputy governor timothy lane can clear it up or just plain elaborate when he gives an economic progress report to a business audience and holds a news conference in ottawa thursday we expect him to continue the messaging that the boc has had over the last few weeks downside risks to the outlook remain from global growth risks and trade uncertainty but fundamentals remain solid in canada with inflation at target said citigroup s ms clark this should continue to be the boc s base case into 2020 suggesting no need for further monetary policy accommodation if it holds she added while the boc would lower rates if a substantially weaker outlook warranted it along with the fed for now it will remain hesitant to do so given the future financial stability risks associated with a further build up of debt given low interest rates read more markets at a glance read more what global pmis

what is city talk city talk allows marketers to connect directly with our audience by publishing content on cityam com brexit 23 answers to investors questions the uk s scheduled departure from the eu is fast approaching many observers are hopeful for an orderly withdrawal but plenty of potential pitfalls between now and brexit day which could result in a chaotic divorce the only near certainty at present is that the uk will cease to be a full member of the eu on 29 march 2019 it is possible that brexit could be delayed a second referendum called or uk parliament abandon the project but at this late stage and as things stand these scenarios seem unlikely negotiators are currently working on a withdrawal agreement to be followed by a transition period to run from the end of march 2019 to the end of december 2020 during the transition period negotiations would focus on the permanent future uk eu relationship including any potential agreement on trade most aspects of the uk s eu membership would remain in place until december 2020 under this scenario including free movement across borders and inclusion within the customs union and single market however in the event of no agreement or a so called no deal brexit what happens after 29 march 2019 is uncertain amid the uncertainty sue noffke uk equities fund manager addresses some of the most pressing questions for investors 1 what are the key dates for investors to watch out for while deadlines for talks are flexible most commentators believe a withdrawal agreement needs to be in place by the end of 2018 at the latest this would allow the individual member states enough time to ratify the agreement once the eu and uk leaders have signed off the final text while the majority of the agreement s text has been settled upon there remains some distance between the two sides particularly around the irish border this has led to questions over whether the text will be ready ahead of october s european council summit there is the potential for a summit in november and the scheduled meeting in december is widely seen as the last practical date for an agreement to be signed off by eu and uk leaders 2 in addition to eu member states ratifying the agreement does uk parliament also need to approve it yes uk parliament will vote on the withdrawal agreement the conservative government lost its parliamentary majority at last year s general election and the market is agonising whether it can rally sufficient support to get an agreement passed an uncertain uk domestic political situation has also added to market fears that the country may end up with a no deal brexit 3 what does the withdrawal agreement cover citizens rights the uk s financial commitments to the eu and the irish border only during the transition period will the details of the permanent future relationship between the uk and eu be negotiated including trade arrangements in the event of no deal in extreme circumstances the uk and eu would revert to world trade organisation wto trade arrangements on 29 march 2019 4 the type of brexit we get will have consequences for the uk economy but how important is the uk economy to the uk stock market for the market overall less than a third of its revenues are derived from the uk so what is going on in the rest of the world is often more important there are sectors that are more exposed to imported goods and or the uk consumer where sterling weakness would be a potential negative 5 how do you look at the uk stock market in terms of brexit and other top down factors we take a bottom up perspective looking for companies that have strong balance sheets enjoy robust market positions and are serving resilient end markets we seek to avoid those suffering the effects of disintermediation the internet is increasingly allowing the manufacturers of products or providers of services to communicate directly with end customers or exposed to structurally challenged markets we then carry out a sense check of top down considerations asking ourselves if a company is too exposed to moves in sterling and political risks say 6 what has been the market impact of brexit to date in the period from mid 2013 through to the end of 2015 the uk economy outperformed the global economy sterling was strong and uk domestic companies outperformed uk overseas earners see below then as brexit fears set in and the uk voted to leave the eu uk domestics significantly underperformed exchange rates were a major driver of this as the market discounted the beneficial translational impact of weaker sterling for companies with significant overseas earnings however it was also in large part due to uk domestic companies suffering a de rating see below for explanation amid fears the uk economy would grow at a lower rate going forward outside the eu 7 has brexit negatively impacted the whole of the uk stock market yes investors have indiscriminately shunned uk stocks as a consequence of brexit and the market overall has suffered a de rating prior to the eu referendum investors had been prepared to pay approximately 15x the uk stock market s expected aggregate earnings for the year ahead today this multiple or rating is around 13x which compares very favourably to the global stock market trading on approximately 15x expected 2018 aggregate earnings the graphic below expresses these same ratings as price to earnings p e ratios being the markets current levels divided by their respective expected aggregate 2018 earnings it also reveals how regardless of their international exposure the majority of uk sectors trade on attractive ratings versus their global equivalents 8 how might sterling react depending on the possible brexit outcomes sterling has been an effective mechanism for either expressing confidence or fear in brexit and the fate of the uk economy our economists have polled a mix of investment banks and economic consultancies and asked where they thought sterling would trade against the us dollar when it became apparent which scenario the uk was heading for no deal brexit or a withdrawal agreement sterling is currently trading around 1 30 and the graphic below illustrates the responses with the majority expecting significant downside in a no deal scenario the average estimate being around 1 10 downside of approximately 15 in the event of a withdrawal agreement the average estimate is for the currency to appreciate to approximately 1 40 9 in the event of a withdrawal agreement how might the uk stock market perform if we did get a withdrawal agreement there would likely be an upwards movement in sterling and a re rating of the whole market particularly benefiting those uk domestics that have been severely de rated over the last two and a half years that would include the uk focused banks property companies housebuilders consumer discretionary areas general retailers and leisure companies food retailers and media agencies because of the brexit related risks the valuations of the uk focused banks lloyds banking royal bank of scotland and barclays are very attractive versus their eu and international peers this is a significant component of the uk stock market roughly 5 which could perform very well 10 in light of the risks of a no deal brexit are banks more robust than they were 10 years ago yes uk banks are financially stronger than they were prior to the global financial crisis gfc given improved capital adequacy standards banks are required to hold more capital to cover possible losses on loans and the definition of what counts as capital is much tighter the regulatory framework governing banks is more robust with a greater number and more diverse range of rules supervised by new oversight bodies and they are subject to regular reviews or stress tests to ensure compliance with latest regulatory standards meanwhile the bank of england boe is better able to step in and provide short term funding or liquidity when required the failure of the interbank lending market where banks with surplus funds lend to those in need of short term funding was a major contributory factor to the gfc 11 would companies have scope to mitigate higher import costs should sterling fall sharply there tend to be lags built into the system which could help to soften the immediate blow companies importing goods whether finished product consumer electronics clothes and food for instance or components vehicle parts for assembly within the uk say have financial methods of shielding themselves in the short term against adverse movements in exchange rates known as currency hedging in addition they will have a certain amount of finished product in stock or inventory which can be run down to be replenished with lower spec product to maintain price points i e new tv models may not have all the bells and whistles companies may also face challenges in terms of disruptions to their supply chains car manufacturers clothing and food retailers particularly retailers of fresh foods may be most at risk in this regard 12 presumably companies will not be able to mitigate the impact indefinitely no and should sterling fall by 15 i am sure that the uk economy would slow down where it is possible for them to do so companies would raise prices or where customers are unwilling to pay up absorb the pain of higher costs themselves at the expense of profits despite the robust uk jobs market and the return of real wage growth it is uncertain how consumers might react as higher prices erode their spending power they have been spending at above average rates as reflected in the low uk savings rate relative to historical levels and we suspect consumers would cut back and make choices 13 which sub sectors of the stock market would be most at risk from the return of inflationary pressures certain parts of the consumer discretionary space within the general retail sector sellers of big ticket items including cars white goods or household fixtures such as kitchens and double glazing units specialist retailers of smaller ticket luxuries such as cosmetics could also be at risk within leisure tour operators might be vulnerable as consumers favour staycations in place of more expensive overseas holidays while restaurant and pub companies would likely see less trade as people eat and drink out less 14 how might a no deal brexit influence uk monetary and fiscal policy in the event of a no deal we would not expect the boe to change interest rates but instead look through the possible negative impact on the economy of sterling weakness and increased inflationary pressures we could however see a repeat of other elements of the central bank s policy response following the 2016 eu referendum result when in addition to cutting base rates to 0 25 the boe injected liquidity into the financial system and used forward guidance to reassure the market over the future path of base rates it may be that fiscal measures are used in place of monetary ones but this year s budget has been moved forward to october so any measures would likely be unveiled at a later date once there is more clarity over brexit measures could include tax breaks in order to stimulate capital investment by companies or stimulate investment into small and medium sized companies the government has also raised the prospect of a significant reduction in the rate of corporation tax in the event of no deal we could also see sector specific policies such as additional support for the government s help to buy scheme 15 what would you expect to happen to uk interest rates should there be a withdrawal agreement in that event we are more likely to see a rise in interest rates the boe increased base rates in august to 0 75 as it judged the slowdown in the uk economy in the first quarter of 2018 to be temporary and related to the very cold weather at the beginning of the year this subsequently transpired to be the case with preliminary gdp data from the office for national statistics revealing growth had bounced back in q2 albeit in part helped by the very warm summer and world cup higher frequency indicators suggest that the positive momentum has continued into q3 all other things being equal should there be a withdrawal agreement we would expect interest rates to move up gradually 16 how important is it to maintain a global perspective and not just focus on brexit more often than not global developments set the tone for the uk stock market at present us china trade relations and fears around the stability of emerging markets ems are key considerations ems have come under pressure as global financial conditions have become tighter since the gfc the world economy has enjoyed the benefits of 10 years of low interest rates and quantitative easing qe qe is effectively central banks pumping money directly into the financial system by way of asset purchases buying mainly bonds to keep lenders lending and corporates spending qe however is now giving way to quantitative tightening qt as central banks globally turn net sellers of bonds to remove money from the financial system 17 why is the health of emerging markets important to the outlook for the uk stock market the financials and materials sectors are major components of the uk stock market and both have significant exposure to ems in addition there are many other multinational companies quoted on the uk stock market which have significant em operations in south africa south america and asia currency crises in turkey and argentina have provoked new questions around the wider stability of ems against the backdrop of a resurgent dollar this is at a time when global financial conditions are becoming more restrictive the us federal reserve is tightening monetary conditions through qt and higher base rates raising base rates by 100 basis points over the past 12 months to a target of 2 2 25 and the european central bank is on course to end qe later in 2018 18 is the backdrop of 10 years of rising markets another consideration yes it is always worth remembering that economic activity waxes and wanes and the period of time in which an economy moves from a state of expansion to one of contraction before expanding again is known as the economic or business cycle since the gfc many major economies have experienced a long period of uninterrupted growth and as a result expectations are rising that they are due a downturn at such a mature stage in the business cycle stock markets also tend to approach their peaks late in the business cycle and so the longevity of the current bull market could also be seen as a potential source of concern 19 merger and acquisition m a activity has been picking up globally with uk quoted companies of particular interest why m a1 often becomes a more prominent feature as the business cycle becomes more mature and corporates start to exhaust their organic growth opportunities while also wanting to make the most of readily available cheap debt financing uk m a has picked up as overseas corporate buyers of assets have exploited the uk s attractive relative valuation and the weakness in sterling this has acted as somewhat of a counterbalance the majority of inbound m a certainly by value has been overseas companies or global private equity investors targeting world leading uk quoted companies there has been a bidding war for broadcaster sky culminating in a blind auction won by us cable group comcast while fellow ftse 100 company shire has recommended an offer from japanese pharmaceutical peer takeda 20 we ve recently seen m a targeting uk domestic companies what can be read into this deals need to be analysed on a case by case basis coca cola s bid for whitbread s costa coffee chain is largely about the us soft drinks group taking the target s machine technology and specialist knowledge of the hot drinks industry and rolling it out globally however the bid for john laing infrastructure fund jlif by infrastructure fund managers dalmore capital and equitix investment management can be viewed in a different context jlif invests in public private partnerships ppps predominately in the uk covering a whole array of sectors from roads rail schools and hospitals jlif has been among the key ppp backers of the intercity express programme which has delivered new high speed trains on the great western mainline running out of london paddington following the bid for jlif many of the other uk focused infrastructure funds bounced back from prior weakness the bid gave comfort that on a longer term view suppressed valuations of more domestic oriented businesses are offsetting the risks related to brexit 21 will london remain an attractive base for global companies after brexit to deal with the potential brexit scenarios many companies with bases in london are establishing footprints in other european capitals whether paris berlin or dublin for example there have however been positive stories in favour of the uk whether that be google pushing ahead with plans to develop its new uk hq at king s cross st pancras or luxury goods makers chanel opting for london as the location of its new global hq while the chanel hq is not going to be create large numbers of jobs the choice of london has potentially wider significance in light of speculation that the company s owners may be preparing to float the business on the public markets chanel cited the uk as important for its central location in relation to end markets the use of english language in international business and strong corporate governance standards 22 how has brexit affected dividend payments over the past couple of years approximately 40 of uk stock market dividends are declared in overseas currencies mainly us dollars but also a significant proportion in euros as a result currency moves can have a major impact on the level of sterling distributions dividends have risen due to a combination of weaker sterling resulting from brexit and good underlying dividend growth in the mid to high single digits the dividend cover of the uk stock market a ratio which measures the number of times the market s aggregate dividends can be paid out of its aggregate earnings has improved over the past couple of years this has occurred against the backdrop of higher commodity prices largely related to the pick up in the global economy which has driven a recovery in earnings of the significant oil and mining sectors 23 and what about the prospects for the other big engine of uk dividends the banks because of the higher capital adequacy requirements future returns from banks are expected to be lower than they have been in the past however as banks pursue more conservative business models and grow more slowly it is likely they will return a greater proportion of any excess capital to shareholders rather than reinvest it into the business this could be returned to shareholders in the form or ordinary dividends special dividends or share buybacks we have seen this happen with lloyds banking and royal bank of scotland has recently indicated that it is in a position to follow suit

the markets continue to seem optimistic the strength of the us flash pmi offered a contrast of most high income regions major the s p 500 and the dow jones stoxx 600 advanced last week after falling the previous week for the first time since early october benchmark 10 year bond yields were mixed asia pacific experienced small declines as did the core in europe the periphery of europe and the us saw modest increases on the month the backing up the peripheral yields was striking italy led the way with a 30 bp increase spain rose by about 18 bp even after trump signed the bills ostensibly to protect hong kong and the subsequent threats by china many still see a trade deal in the making as both sides seem to want it expectations have been scaled back in terms of substance some think an announcement is possible as early as the coming days the market already appears to be pricing in the end to the escalation of the tariff battle the key to the response could be the extent of the roll back there is some hope after last week s unscheduled talks between the us canada and mexico that the us house of representatives could signal the intention of bringing the usmca to a vote this would likely mean that the democratic leadership thinks it has the vote to approve it the us dollar was mixed but the underlying tone remains firm it finished last week near key levels against the yen jpy109 50 euro 1 10 and swiss franc chf1 0030 sterling remains supported by speculation that the tories can secure a parliamentary majority at the december 12 election the australian dollar bled lower and has fallen for four consecutive weeks dragged down especially by latin america the jp morgan emerging market currency index fell nearly 0 4 last week its fifth straight weekly decline dollar index the dollar index reached its highest level 98 55 since mid october before reversing lower in the waning hours of the last session of november thin markets and month end considerations may have exaggerated the decline it nearly wiped out the week s gains leaving the dollar index three thousandths of an index point higher on the week initial support is seen near 98 00 and a break of the 97 70 area would warn that of a corrective phase rather than just consolidation on the other hand a move above 98 70 would signal a test on the october 1 high around 99 50 the slow stochastics did not confirm last week s high though the macd continues to trend higher the dollar index gained a little less than 1 in november after losing 2 in october euro the single currency posted a potential reversal ahead of the weekend by making new low since october 10 1 0980 before rallying through the previous session high a little below 1 1020 and closing near the highs in candlestick terms it may be a bullish hammer however thin markets and month end flows caution against reading too much into it news of the change in spd leadership has increased the risk that the german government falls but on balance it seems more likely to renegotiate the terms of the coalition the party will take a formal vote at the end of next week for the week the euro finished three hundredths of a cent lower and 1 2 weaker on the month it fell by 2 3 in october the euro has not been above 1 1030 since november 25 the month s downtrend line starts december near 1 1060 the macd and slow stochastics are above

higher on the week the greenback rose 1 35 against the yen in november the macd and slow stochastics give no reason not to look for a further advance with jpy110 00 being the next important chart point the cautionary note comes from the upper bollinger band which begins the new week near jpy109 60 sterling the british pound gained 0 7 last week completely recouping the 0 5 lost the previous week it was virtually flat in november losing 17 100 of a penny after gaining 5 3 in october since the middle of october it has chopped between 1 28 and 1 30 sterling recorded an outside up day in the middle of the last week but did not signal a break of the range many investors appear to be confident that the tories will win the december 12 election and that the uk will leave the eu by the end of january the broad sideways movement has neutered the momentum indicators after the election is out of the way investors attention may turn to the economy which is weakening canadian dollar the us dollar spent last week within 20 25 pips of cad1 3300 neither the end of the rail strike in canada nor the optimism about the usmca had much impact the technical indicators suggest the next move will be a weaker greenback the macds have flatlined near its highs and the slow stochastics are rolling over the us dollar rose almost 1 in november after falling by about 1 in the previous two months initial support is seen near cad1 3250 the bank of canada is widely expected to restate its neutrality after its policymaking meeting on december 4 however the jobs data a couple days may help investors locate the bar to a cut australian dollar the australian dollar could not distance itself from the 0 6770 support area it fell 0 35 to extend its losing streak to the fourth consecutive week the price action and the technical indicators give little reasons to think that low is in place though the slow stochastics is overextended a test on the lower bollinger band still allows lower levels 0 6735 the early august and october lows were set near 0 6670 and are increasingly coming into view mexican peso the us dollar rose against the mexican peso for the fourth week in the past five its 0 8 rise last week accounted for half of its gain 1 55 for november the momentum indicators suggest there is scope for more gains a convincing break of the mxn19 64 area which was flirted with last week and houses the upper bollinger band would complete a potential rounded bottom it projects toward mxn20 20 though the october high around mxn19 86 may be the first hurdle the peso partly serves as the liquid accessible proxy for emerging markets and now latam currencies brazil and chile s central banks intervened last week to support their currencies those two and the colombian peso were suffered the largest losses among emerging market currencies initial dollar support is seen near mxn19 40 chinese yuan the dollar drifted lower against the chinese yuan last week posting losses of less than 0 1 in four of the five sessions for the entire month of november the dollar was barely changed even after trump signed the hong kong bills volatility did not rise and the yuan did not weaken the dollar has traded in cny7 00 cny7 05 range over the past couple of weeks the stronger than expected official pmi may be more of an equity than a currency story the shanghai composite rallied earlier this year but november was the third consecutive monthly decline while the losses have been modest 1 2 of this run in stands in contrast most other markets the msci emerging market equities index slipped about 0 2 in november but over the past three months is up about 5 5 gold gold edged about 2 an ounce higher last week support around 1450 has been tested several times and although the downside momentum has been exhausted the has been little interest in the upside a move now above 1468 1470 could spur some technical buying the 1480 area corresponds to the neckline of a potential double bottom which would project toward 1510 the macd has flatlined in oversold territory the slow stochastics are curling up from higher levels oil thin markets may have exacerbated the drop in crude prices before the weekend the little more than 5 decline was the largest in two months the unexpected rise in the us inventories did not help matters but it seemed to have been the saudi s complaint on the eve of next week s opec meeting that sent prices reeling saudi arabia indicated its frustration of bearing the cost of supply cuts this may be a negotiating ploy even as prices climbed over the last couple of weeks we have read the technical indicators as favoring caution the macd and slow stochastics continue to gradually rollover a break of the 54 70 area could signal another dollar decline before stronger support is found us rates the us 10 year yield traded in about a 6 5 bp range last week 1 73 1 795 it was the narrowest range in at least six months the yield rose by 8 5 bp last month it was the third monthly increase the momentum indicators of the december note futures contract favors the downside of prices warning of the risk of yields may test the recent highs a little below 2 the us yield curve 2y 10y looks poised to re steepen it peaked near the middle of november near 27 bp and fell a little below 15 bp by late in the month s p 500 the s p 500 rose about 1 last week despite the 0 4 decline before the weekend to bring the monthly advance to 3 4 the small gap created by the higher opening at midweek was closed after thursday s thanksgiving holiday we continue to suspect the market is getting ahead of itself and still see the momentum indicators as stretched the s p 500 gapped higher to start the week and that gap 3112 9 3117 8 filling that gap would require taking out the two month uptrend line 3125 on december 2
the scandals the leaks the outrages and the bizarre tweets of the last three years can distract from an important fact about president donald trump he has changed policy in ways that affect the lives of millions of americans some of the trump agenda is standard for a republican president white collar criminal prosecutions have hit a 33 year low the justice department defends state laws that could kick thousands off the voting rolls the national labor relations board is now more sympathetic to employers than unions and military spending is on track to reach the same levels as during the height of the iraq war but he s gone further while the media understandably focuses on trump s many scandals his administration has quietly enacted a far more aggressive agenda than his republican predecessors big boosts to fossil fuel production have come at the expense of an unprecedented deterioration in air quality tens of thousands of people have lost health insurance by administrative fiat and millions are in the process of losing their nutritional assistance through the same mechanism he s remade the judiciary installing conservative judges at twice obama s pace and he s consolidated a conservative majority on the supreme court that may endure for decades tax changes were trump s biggest legislative accomplishment creating a huge windfall for wealthy shareholders and small gains for the middle class with revenue losses much larger than initially forecast he s also undertaken significant but little noticed alternations in supervision of wall street that increase the riskiness of the banking system plus drastic changes to immigration policy that go far beyond wall construction the immigration changes align with trump s main campaign themes even if they don t line up in detail with what he promised but much of this amounts to delivering for big business and the wealthy in a much more dramatic way than his populist positioning would indicate promises to voters to protect clean air provide better health care crack down on banks and tax the rich have fallen entirely by the wayside as 2020 approaches trump s achievements are a reminder that trump and his team are doing real things that have real impacts on real lives his successes explain why the conservative movement is solidly behind him despite its considerable doubts from four years ago regardless of what trump tweets or says or does during the election it s worth remembering there s more to him than the trump show more oil and gas production less environmental regulation a major trend of trump era policymaking has been to roll back environmental regulation this involves going through the process of promulgating new rules that are far more lax than those they replace the new york times has identified 53 separate rules that have completed the rollback process and 32 more that are still in the works it s not unusual for republican administrations to take a more skeptical view of environmental regulation but the trump administration really has been more uniformly aggressive on this front than its predecessors as seen by criticism of the trump environmental protection agency by several of the agency s reagan and bush era chiefs this reflects the growing polarization of environmental policy issues which used to be less strictly aligned with larger left right policy disputes but it also reflects one of the key themes of trump era policymaking in general a tendency toward recklessness with regard to politics and public opinion obscured in part by the large volume of coverage dedicated to trump scandals and trump s personal behavior as a candidate trump was vocally skeptical of climate change regulations but specifically vowed to promote clean air and water which are overwhelmingly popular causes but trump has moved to roll back dozens of rules on these subjects without the changes ever becoming a focus of sustained public debate most of these rollbacks impacts will be felt primarily in the long term but already particulate pollution is getting worse reversing years of progress a team of researchers at carnegie mellon estimates that 9 700 more americans died due to air pollution in 2018 than in 2016 in part due to regulatory changes but the trump administration is moving to restrict the range of evidence used to demonstrate air pollution s harms hoping to forestall the promulgation of new standards that would lead to stricter regulation in tandem with the regulatory rollback trump s goal of boosting america s natural resource extraction industries has been largely successful there is no broad based revival of the coal industry but employment in coal mining has stabilized and is rising slightly in a reversal of recent trends american oil output has soared to the point where net imports of crude oil and petroleum products are at their lowest level in generations and the country is likely to become a net exporter in the near future natural gas output meanwhile has soared to record highs continuing a rapid growth pattern that began during the obama presidency the reasons are more technological than regulatory but policy has made a difference at the margins trump values boosting extractive industries over environmental protection and energy production has increased substantially while the air gets dirtier and carbon dioxide emissions rise paring back the welfare state trump speaks frequently albeit somewhat vaguely about his business deregulation activities but there s a sphere of regulatory activism he speaks about much less the paring back of the social safety net efforts to repeal the affordable care act failed in congress and while house republicans briefly tried to mobilize around a program for cuts in a broad array of non health safety net programs their senate colleagues weren t interested in taking it up more recently however a more modest version of this agenda has been pursued through regulation that starts with allowing states to impose work requirements on their medicaid programs arkansas was the first state to take this step and nearly 20 000 people lost insurance as a result before a federal district court judge put the waivers on hold kentucky also received a work requirements waiver but andy bevin s election as governor means his state will reverse course despite the district court ruling against the administration it is likely to prevail at the higher levels of a judicial system that is increasingly dominated by gop appointees beyond the specifics of the medicaid waiver fight the uninsurance rate has risen steadily under trump despite an improving labor market seemingly because of the administration s lack of interest in vigorous implementation of the affordable care act he s also acted to re legalize skimpy insurance plans that don t cover prescription drugs or maternity benefits the trump administration has also launched a three pronged rulemaking effort to limit federal spending on the supplemental nutrition assistance program snap that started with tougher work requirements that could cost 755 000 people their benefits and was followed up by rule changes that would make about 3 million beneficiaries of a different anti poverty program ineligible for snap most recently the administration proposed some technical changes to how utility costs are calculated that will generate slightly higher benefits for 13 percent of snap recipients and larger benefit cuts to about 16 percent of snap recipients the scale of these changes is tiny compared to the massive cuts to the safety net once envisioned by former house speaker paul ryan to say nothing of ryan s vision of cutting federal spending on the elderly but the impact on the lives of several million people is substantial and striking in light of the fact that reducing federal spending or narrowing the deficit don t appear to be goals the administration is seriously pursuing trump reshaped the tax code the trump administration has only one really big legislative accomplishment to its name the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 which initiated a range of changes in both individual and business taxation in the united states republicans both in the administration and on capitol hill insisted that the tax cuts would pay for themselves through faster economic growth which predictably hasn t happened what s not as well known is that corporate tax revenue actually fell by more than anticipated in 2018 and has only marginally rebounded in 2019 in part as a result the budget deficit has been rising faster than the congressional budget office thought it would even though lower than anticipated interest rates have helped the government save money the big issue is that the investment boom boosters promised didn t come to fruition any more than republicans delivered on the promise of a tax code simple enough that you can file on a postcard at the same time while many democrats fumed about the huge increase in the deficit tcja was sure to set off it s very difficult to find any evidence that the increase in public borrowing has been a problem not only do the government s borrowing costs remain low global macroeconomic conditions have been weak enough that the federal reserve ended up reversing course this year and slightly cutting interest rates under the circumstances fiscal stimulus delivered by trump in the form not only of tax cuts but also higher spending on both military and non military categories has been economically useful whether or not you think his specific fiscal ideas make sense beyond cutting rates trump has also reshaped the tax code in important ways by substantially increasing the standard deduction tcja has reduced the number of families who itemize tax deductions and thus in effect made all deductions less valuable and economically important pairing this with a reduction in the amount of home mortgage interest that is eligible for tax deductibility has in particular narrowed the scope of the mortgage interest tax deduction long seen as a sacred cow of the tax code and done so without notably disrupting the real estate market tcja also famously capped the deductibility of state and local taxes a change that s unfavorable to blue states and has sparked some half hearted efforts by congressional democrats to restore full deductibility reverting to the pre trump treatment of state and local taxes would however be a big tax cut for the rich and it s noteworthy that none of the democratic presidential candidates have embraced this rollback taxes are always changing and if democrats do well in 2020 it s predictable that taxes will go up especially on the rich reversing much of the fiscal and economic impact of trump s bill but the reshaping of the deductions landscape is likely to be a somewhat enduring and arguably progressive part of his legacy a bonanza for banks as a candidate and at times in the early days of his administration trump espoused the idea of bringing back glass steagall regulations that would have required the breakup of large financial services companies that kind of talk evaporated quickly however and in office one of trump s most significant areas of policymaking has been a big step back from the more stringent financial regulations enacted in the wake of the financial crisis the clearest manifestation of that trend was a 2018 bill authored by sen mike crapo r id and backed by many moderate democrats there were a bunch of moving parts to this bill but its key provision was raising the threshold for the highest level of regulatory scrutiny from banks with at least 50 billion in assets to banks with at least 250 billion in assets but legislative action is just the beginning of a much broader push trump s federal reserve appointees promulgated a more tailored version of the obama era supplementary leverage rule allowing the biggest banks to take on more debt and more risk the securities and exchange commission has brought 40 percent fewer regulatory actions his financial stability oversight council has removed the obama administration s designation of non bank financial institutions as systemically significant and subject to stricter regulatory oversight dodd frank requires large banks to maintain updated living wills that detail a plan to safely wind down operations in the event of a failure trump has relaxed the rule allowing banks to update their plans once every four years rather than annually sparing banks some hassle but raising the risk that outdated plans could blow up the banking system the law also requires banks to submit to stress tests that simulate their stability in the event of economic problems trump s appointees have made the tests less frequent and also easier to pass the upshot of all this has been to make banks more profitable which in turn has contributed to strong trump era stock market performance and unlike in the pollution case nothing bad necessarily happens when bank regulation becomes more lax financial crises are inherently rare but in a quiet behind the scenes way a banking system that was made safer after the crisis is getting riskier again trump has reshaped immigration immigration has been at the heart of trump s politics from the moment he descended the elevator at trump tower and announced he was running for office and once he took office he immediately set about changing immigration policy with the first version of his travel ban but outside of the losing skirmish over funding for a border wall there have barely been any efforts to get congressional action on immigration despite the brief surge of attention to the family separation policy the bulk of these changes have taken place with relatively little debate though the cancellation of daca currently under review by the courts will doubtless attract considerable attention if it does ultimately get approved by the supreme court as vox s nicole narea has detailed for example the trump administration built up layer by layer a series of impediments in central america at the border in detention centers and in the immigration courts that have made obtaining asylum nearly impossible but many of trump s changes have involved legal immigration rather than the hot button topic of illegal immigration or the gray area of asylum seeking trump has cut refugee resettlements by over 80 percent he s made it more difficult to get h 1b visas for skilled technology workers and is in the process of stripping their spouses of work permits most recently he is proposing new regulations that according to the migration policy institute could bar hundreds of thousands of legal immigrants per year from the country by denying visas to would be immigrants who cannot prove to a consular officer that they will obtain health insurance within 30 days of their arrival in the us this has been put on hold by a district court but like the medicaid waivers issue the decision will ultimately be made by higher courts that are stacked with republican appointees a remade judiciary trump speaks frequently about his judicial appointments in part because he has genuinely had a large impact here and in part because so much of the rest of his policy impact is inherently tied up with the courts with relatively little legislation under his belt trump s policymaking has largely consisted of aggressive use of executive discretion that s what obama did during his second term and conservatives found a means to counter it by identifying friendly jurisdictions to sue in and getting district courts to stay obama s actions pending further litigation democrats have responded in kind under trump and consequently many of his biggest regulatory changes have not yet fully taken effect the difference is that from day one trump has enjoyed a gop senate majority and the new rules whereby judicial nominees cannot be filibustered by the minority consequently trump has seen federal judges appointed and confirmed at a record rate he s put 46 circuit court judges on the bench in three years compared to 55 across eight years of obama meaning a bit over a quarter of appeals court judges are now trump appointees if these judges ultimately rule in his favor the short term consequences for both immigration and the safety net will be large over and above the obvious longer term impact of the judiciary but the extent to which judicial nominations loom large in trump s policy résumé underscores how thin it is the senate has had ample floor time to consider his nominees because members simply haven t done much legislating that s left trump with executive actions that have certainly been consequential in spots especially in his key areas of rhetorical focus around energy and immigration but still a considerably smaller impact than his recent predecessors who all signed several major pieces of legislation

has been confined to about a cny7 02 cny7 0450 range since mid november europe the manufacturing pmi for the eurozone improved from the flash reading of 46 6 to 46 9 and 45 9 in october this was a function of german and french reports being revised up germany s stands at 44 1 from the 43 8 flash reading the manufacturing pmi may have bottomed in september at 41 7 the french reading ticked up to 51 7 from the 51 6 initial estimate and 50 7 in october it bottomed in july at 49 7 italy slipped to 47 6 from 47 7 its low was in march at 47 4 spain bounced from its cyclical low of 46 8 in october

but remains below the 50 boom bust it stood at 49 6 in october and fell to 48 9 not 48 3 in november it had bottomed in august at 47 4 the german social democrats chose new leaders that have been more critical of the grand coalition with merkel s cdu still it would be an exaggeration to see this a left tilt for example the new leaders walter borjans and eskek propose a minimum wage in germany of 12 euros which is less than what is being proposed by uk prime minister johnson the spd is ill prepared drawing less than 15 support in recent polls vs 20 5 in 2017 for an election so leaving the coalition now does not seem particularly likely a vote this coming weekend will likely confirm this but new leaders may seek to re negotiate the 2018 coalition agreement the cdu is in an awkward position as well it does not want to re open the coalition agreement while the spd is being challenged by the greens from the left the cdu is being outflanked to the right however the transition to a post merkel era has been anything but smooth it too would likely see its support fall in a snap election were to be held now the euro remains mired in a narrow range of a little more than 15 pips today it has held above 1 1010 and has not been much above 1 1025 there nearly 1 3 bln euros of options between 1 0995 and 1 1000 that will be cut today ecb president lagarde s first speech to the

inspiring the atlanta gdp tracker to jump to 1 7 in q4 from 0 4 however the ny fed s model was less impressed and ticked up to 0 8 from 0 7 the bank of canada meets in the middle of the week and is widely expected to keep rates steady 1 75 the november jobs report will be released at the end of the week employment is expected to have gained 10k after a small decline in october the highlight for mexico this week maybe today s pmi both the manufacturing and non manufacturing readings are expected to have remained below 50 the intervention that chile announced last week begins today the dollar fell 2 2 against the peso before the weekend as positions were adjusted the greenback still rose almost 1 5 last week to extend its streak to the seventh consecutive week the chilean central bank will sell 200 a day this week and place 200 in the forward market is well the central bank meets on wednesday and despite the currency s weakness many still expect it to cut the official cash rate by 25 bp

its role as a proxy for other emerging market currencies especially in latam recently have worked against it it reached almost mxn19 66 last week and fell to mxn19 4250 ahead of the weekend
abstract since 2010 there has been a discernable expansion of global health financing forms using private equity bonds and facilities to finance international development and humanitarian endeavors i present the logics of the pandemic emergency facility pef a world bank device that lashes together a bond cash and swaps to lie in reserve for an infectious disease outbreak i explain how the pef is emblematic of financial devices that have the potential to fund global health aid while offering investors a chance to make money reckoning with the pandemic bond means that we take account not only of the pef what does it organize and by what logics but also of the relationships it cultivates what does it bind together and reproduces what does it aim to multiply and what does it forsake i use reckoning with as an analytic concept to help us think about measures and futures of global health in both economic and ethical registers as well as to take account of how death data is used reckoning with something lets us pause to take account of where we are and where we are going and helps us think about what we want is it necessary to translate the ethical obligation to help those who are suffering into financial devices that make people money a trend we are clearly in the initial stages of are there conditions when the suffering of others as the source of financial speculation becomes desirable as government funding for public health care becomes increasingly forsaken and as global investors elect to pick up where nation states have left off practical and ethical questions emerge about the mechanisms through which collective health futures will be financed reckoning with these questions is urgent because new financial mechanisms to fund health are being established now mostly outside of public view the devices are complex and born of multiple and competing interests and perspectives they force a reckoning if money for pandemic emergency response is not otherwise available should investors be able to make money speculating on pandemics what does pandemic investability mean for our collective health futures as part of my research on the financialization of global health i reckon with these questions through the emergence of the pandemic bond which is the money making part of the world bank s pandemic emergency facility pef a financial device designed to provide money for pandemics my ethnographic entry point into this bond is the 2014 2016 ebola outbreak in sierra leone where i have worked for decades my interest in the bond emerged from a first research project conducted coincidentally at the same time as the ebola outbreak in which i was following health data which led me to a second project in 2016 to follow the money the pef appeared on the global health financial scene in 2017 decades after governments around the world chose austerity driven cutbacks in health care or had them imposed upon them weakening or underbuilding health care infrastructures the governments of sierra leone liberia and guinea and their respective health care systems were severely challenged when the ebola virus killed thousands of their citizens from 2013 through 2016 but health care response ability haraway 2016 had been circumscribed in those west african nation states for decades domestic political strife and war had depleted treasuries making monies far less available for health education and welfare the world trade organization and international financial institutions such as the world bank and the international monetary fund also hobbled the implementation of a sierra leonean health system and curtailed its capacity to respond kentikelenis et al 2015 zack williams 2012 see also pfeiffer and chapman for health impacts from structural adjustment and basu carney and kenworthy for post 2008 impacts resulting from austerity policies don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free in this context jim yong kim a physician anthropologist and the then world bank president promoted the pef as a response to those failures in october 2014 kim began publicly advocating for a new pandemic emergency facility that would deliver money to countries in crisis during future disease outbreaks world bank 2014a it was a message he repeated three months later at the world economic forum in davos switzerland where he won over global financial thought leaders many of whom had complained for years about the aid industry s inefficiencies typically after a disastrous event donors pledge funds but fewer than half fulfill their commitments grépin 2015 shifting pandemic emergency response from bilateral and donor funding to wall street financing is meant to fix a central problem of crisis financing money is unavailable at the optimal time to stop or contain a threat wall street is meant here in the metonymical sense inclusive of global capital market sites where people institutions and corporations can buy and sell financial instruments to make money kim backed the pef saying that if it had existed in 2014 during the ebola outbreak in west africa we could have mobilized 100 million dollars months before money actually flowed at a time when the epidemic was only one tenth as severe instead it cost 10 billion dollars for emergency response recovery efforts and in economic losses to the affected countries world bank 2016b the next year in his 2017 american anthropology association keynote address kim aaa 2017 championed the pef as a way to insure the poor against pandemics we went to the capital markets and we actually raised 450 million now it exists we have pandemic insurance so the 74 poorest countries in the world including liberia sierra leone and guinea now when ebola happens with the first case we have a bunch of cash that will go right out to try and stop it thank you emphasis added to be clear the pef does not insure poor people per se it is not health insurance in the conventional sense and despite what kim said the pef money raised in the capital markets is not available at the first case of ebola or even the 249th until the official death count reaches 250 no money is released and even then there are other criteria to meet in what follows i explore the pandemic bond portion of the pef in more detail but first offer some thoughts on the work that reckoning with can do when a device like the pef augurs new ethical economies of global health aid influenced by nelson 2009 i use reckoning with as an analytic concept to help think about measures and futures of global health in both economic and ethical registers reckoning with is a process a way of taking account of where we are and where we are going it is a pause that gives a chance for the unnoticed to be noticed reckoning with is not an undoing but rather a reflection in the moment it makes space for some contemplation and understanding before condoning or condemning we can consider does this financial device shape a world we want in this case reckoning with the pef means considering not only the financial device what does it organize and by what logics but also the relationships it cultivates what does it bind together and reproduces what kinds of relationships are strengthened and which are forsaken reckoning with the pef raises simmelesque questions about the obligations and exchanges between people who have much and people who have too little reckoning with the means of financial and health inequities is important which brings up a second way i reckon with i take account of the counting of the global health data that triggers the pandemic bond should a poor country s health care failures become sites of wealth speculation and accumulation which would be one way to merge poor people s right to health with the obligation of wealthy people and countries to alleviate suffering in embracing this new financing what do societies give up an economist editorial suggests that the bond means becoming less queasy about putting the words profit and human suffering in the same sentence 2017 68 but the ethical heft of what the pandemic bond sets in motion is graver than overcoming an upset stomach the pef is a harbinger of future global health finance what do we want to do about that maybe nothing maybe something that s what reckoning with means governments shaped the public health successes of the last 150 years but this is changing as they draw back under austerity dictates before deciding to endorse or denounce the fact of the pandemic bond let s stay with the trouble haraway 2016 long enough to see the world in which the privatized securitization of and for healthy futures is used to justify financial accounting mechanisms that create interest bearing bodies see baucom 2005 let s reckon with living in worlds where it may be necessary to translate the ethical obligation to help those who are suffering into financial devices that make people money a trend we are clearly in the initial stages of one important data point to reckon with everyone i interviewed who had worked to create the pef to the person believed it was a moral good of a high order so let s consider whether in our current and future worlds investors deserve the right as pef advocates phrase it to potentially make money off other people s suffering because other remedies will not be paid for by governments by ideological design are there conditions in which making money from the suffering of others is desirable and should be scaled up what is the pef with the pef the world bank brings together more than sixty diverse groups to frontload money for quick future disbursement if a qualifying pandemic occurs in any of the seventy seven international development association ida countries deemed the world s poorest by the world bank according to the world bank 2016a the pef will deliver timely faster and more cost effective pandemic response more private sector money involvement improved transparency and accountability a strengthening of health systems and a new market the pef covers several diseases including the lassa and rift valley fevers coronaviruses like sars and mers and influenza because the pandemic bond covers ebola a disease that devastated a country whose economy i know well ebola is the disease i use as a touchstone reference throughout this article don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free to clarify the pandemic emergency facility is not a facility in any kind of bricks and mortar sense and although it is sometimes described as insurance it s not insurance in the classic sense that a person pays a premium and then receives money to cover losses from an event and despite the fact that most of its money raising capacity was offered to investors by the world bank as a bond it is not a conventional or vanilla bond with vanilla bonds people or countries buy in that is loan their money for a predetermined duration of the bond while something gets built or funded at maturation a guaranteed principal and interest is paid out instead the pef is a multiaspected largely speculative financial device part insurance part bond part swaps part cash grant that is structured by contractual arrangements many of which are legally binding among the groups involved these arrangements are detailed in a 386 page prospectus world bank 2017c the pef works as a container see figure 1 the world bank pef account holds donor contributions the pandemic bond and swaps an exchange derivative that total us 450 million it also hosts a cash window bestowed with a 50 million euro donation from germany to which australia added us 7 million in 2018 and augmented by other world bank money pots on an as needed basis cash window money can be disbursed on request and operates like old style bilateral aid but with all decisions on payments from the cash window made by a pef steering body world bank 2019 3 rather than a country s department of state or ministry of foreign affairs in this article i focus on the pandemic bond not the cash pot because the pandemic bond is a sign and symbol of the big change in humanitarian finance as governments draw down and capital markets rise up to take over obligations for human health of course these governments and capital markets are peopled and the social life of the bond is the story i tell here as well for the insurance part of the pef the world bank pays insurance premiums with donated money from germany and japan to reinsurance companies on behalf of the seventy seven ida countries covered by the pef the reinsurance companies swissre and munichre pocket those premiums paid by the donors in the future the world bank expects that countries facing pandemic threats will find a way to pay their own premiums that s the insurance part the bond part of the pef launched in july 2017 when twenty six investors bought into a three year bond designed to raise us 320 million for pandemic response investors give their money to the world bank to hold for three years some investors paid us 250 000 the minimum qualifying amount some invested us 50 million if there is a pandemic during those three years the world bank 2019 3 gives some of the investors money to responding agencies to administer emergency care pef funds can be used to finance the cost of response efforts during an outbreak in line with what is described in the country response plan this includes but is not limited to deployment of human resources drugs and medicines essential and critical lifesaving medical equipment including personal protective equipment logistics and supply chain non medical equipment essential life saving goods minor civil works such as setting up temporary care centers services transportation hazard payments communication and coordination etc don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free there are restrictions the maximum payout for example for filoviruses of which ebola is one is capped at us 150 million also pef funds cannot be used for preparedness funds will only be made available in times of crises when countries have been affected by an outbreak world bank 2019 4 and the standing pre vetted pef accredited responding agencies have been limited to four world health organization who united nations children s fund unicef united nations population fund unfpa and food and agriculture organization fao ida countries and aid organizations can apply to become a pef responding agency by submitting an application a world bank chaired steering committee of no more than seven voting and five nonvoting members decide which organizations qualify as responding agencies and get pef funds world bank 2017a 9 if there is no pandemic during the three years the investors get back their money plus interest if they invested in the higher risk portion of the bond they will get back the money they put into the bond plus annual interest of about 14 percent if a pef bond investor invested us 50 million there were reportedly such investors they would receive annual interest of about us 6 81 million over the three year life of the bond they would earn about us 20 43 million in addition to getting their us 50 million back an investment of us 50 million becomes approximately us 70 5 million in three years if there is no pandemic event semiannual interest payments are paid to the investors with the money donated by the german and japanese governments an aspect of the bond s design that stein and sridhar 2017 suggest is unsustainable that donor money which is earmarked as humanitarian aid could otherwise go directly to pandemic relief this has prompted criticism about whether the money should be given directly as aid an opinion that has gained some traction in european and north american aid circles if you find the pef s operational mechanisms confusing so far it s not you the pef is confusing i found even to people working in the finance industry at the world bank i met people who understood singular silo ed elements of the pef very well but were not able to answer questions about other parts part of the problem is that the pef combines aspects of many different financial products so that a public health expert may not fully understand the insurance elements and vice versa as a financial device it is clever but also confusing and i was not surprised to learn it took more than two and a half years to design it had to be made up laboriously combining features of the finance industry with pandemic public health measures the design element that took the longest time to create was the payout triggers money is released or not for emergency care depending on the number of confirmed deaths in the event of a future ebola outbreak in sierra leone for example no money from the pandemic bond is released for a single case or for any cases up to the 249th when the 250th death is officially counted and other criteria are met us 45 million becomes available which is 30 percent of the money designated for filoviruses of which ebola is one sixty percent is available when 750 deaths are documented one hundred percent us 150 million of the bond money designated for filoviruses becomes available when the official count reaches 2 500 deaths other qualifying criteria are written into the bond contract too no matter how many deaths occur within a country payout is only permitted when cases occur in two bordering countries or in a total of eight noncontiguous countries see table 1 note 100 percent payouts do not equal the total us 320 million paid in because no single qualifying epidemic event such as filoviridae viruses like ebola can claim all the bond money raised further as in the recent ebola outbreak in the democratic republic of congo drc which began 1 august 2018 there is also a growth rate threshold that is a number and case growth calculation that must be met for the investors money to be released world bank 2017c pt 32 as of this writing there are more than two thousand confirmed deaths with a few additional deaths over the border in uganda but the growth rate threshold is still being analyzed in later sections i take up the practices and politics of the death counts but first i provide a genealogy to explain the pandemic bond as a logical outcome of changing humanitarian aid practices the pandemic bond is born a genealogy the world bank expanded its bond family when it issued its pandemic bond in 2017 with its first green bond issuance in 2008 and its first catastrophe bond issuance in 2014 world bank backed bonds have become more complex with each generation green bonds work in the conventional way of raising money a bank issues a bond on behalf of for example a government goal investors buy in and if the goal is met by a certain deadline the life of the bond usually three to twenty years the bank for a fee pays investors back the money they put in and the government pays them interest during interviews world bank economists referred to green bonds designed to build environmentally sound green facilities and programs as vanilla bonds for their lack of complexity world bank officials consider green bonds a precursor to the more complex world bank issued catastrophe bonds which in turn inspired pandemic bonds with the issue of the pandemic bond the world bank hopes to catalyze a pandemic bond market in the way that the world bank fostered the development of the green and catastrophe bond markets the world bank is considered at the forefront of innovative financing for development but it is not alone the united nations 2009 has been promoting financial innovation for almost a decade and the rockefeller foundation has made a hard push for an innovative finance revolution madsbjerg and keohane 2016 advancing universal development goals through the breathtaking power of innovation nabarro and schroeder 2016 100 is a concept already well embedded in some international development and humanitarian aid circles the gates and clinton foundations have advocated financial innovation since about 2010 in rich and poor countries alike something was needed to make up for the tax revenue shortfalls in health education and social welfare provisions resulting from the neoliberal austerity schematics introduced in the 1980s market remedies have become the prescriptive fix ushering in the current era of what is called impact investing if investors are willing to risk their money on the chance that their money may be lost the logic goes then they deserve to make money taking on financial risk for the public good should be rewarded according to this view paying for success has become the mantra of impact investing and financial devices known as social impact bonds sibs and development impact bonds dibs have proliferated in earnest sibs got off to a precarious start beginning with the first one issued in england in 2010 the peterborough prison sib did not meet its goal of reducing recidivism but it set a financial precedent nevertheless because the bond device was considered a success this raises a key critique of impact bond logic the social goal need not be fully met if the bond device works to deliver financial returns to investors the first sib issued in the united states was launched in 2012 to reduce the number of sixteen to eighteen year olds returning to new york city jails within twelve months of their release the goal was to cut recidivism rates through a brief cognitive behavioral therapy intervention goldman sachs who operated as both the bank and the investor put up us 7 2 million and stood to make between us 500 000 and us 2 million if predetermined benchmarks were met city of new york 2012 the therapy program failed and goldman sachs lost some of its money the us 7 2 million loss was reduced to a us 1 2 million loss by a us 6 million backup guarantee paid by bloomberg philanthropies the failure of the bond to meet its goals is well known among sib advocates critics and fence straddlers alike see for example rudd et al 2013 cohen and zelnick 2015 dodge 2015 respectively but the bond device worked as designed and a model was born since then the number of sibs has grown as of 2018 there were 108 sibs in twenty four countries rosenberg 2018 most have not yet come to maturity development impact bonds dibs followed applying sib tenets to international development the first the educate girls development impact bond a three year bond that raised us 270 000 to improve educational outcomes for girls in rajasthan india was launched in 2015 and matured in june 2018 the investor ubs optimus foundation stood to make money even if results fell short instiglio 2015 15 projections were that if education targets were fully met the investor would get back its principal investment of us 270 000 plus us 89 085 even if the outcomes met only 86 percent of the projected performance the investor would get an additional us 36 657 a 13 percent return on investment instiglio 2015 5 the interest payment was paid by the children s investment fund foundation a charity created by a former hedge fund manager who would be able to write off the paid interest as a tax deduction when the bond was initiated the investor was speculating on trial outcomes three years in the future their payout was determined by calculating student learning outcomes using standardized tests in clustered randomized control trials see table 2 outcomes would eventually trigger the amount of investor return putting the debates about standardized testing and randomized control trials in education aside this sib example highlights how outcome data was used to make the investor money an issue that affects the pandemic bond as well results from its first two years suggested that the dib was unlikely to meet its education and inclusion goals fully idinsight 2018 8 but by year three the educate girls development impact bond had officially exceeded its enrollment and learning targets the investor got their principal back plus 52 percent interest us 270 000 us 144 085 us 414 085 as was directed by the bond contract but measurement challenges troubled this bond which comes to light in the eleven pages of footnotes and appendixes to the final evaluation report half of the twenty two page report idinsight 2018 numerous dubious and debatable decisions made by the working group highlight just how central data is to bond investing working group members needed the bond to work as an investment that is they needed it to succeed in paying out to investors decisions about the data reflect this the data machinations were extensive questions about what to do with age grade dissonance for example prompted footnotes like this an 8 year old child in grade 3 during year 3 endline is shown as a 6 year old child in grade 1 in this table idinsight 2018 16 debates within the working group about how to count learning gains inspired this decision the working group agreed to err on the side of overestimating learning gains for this group by assuming that the effect of the educate girls program on students not assessed at baseline in grade 5 were the same as the effect on students assessed at baseline idinsight 2018 19 some of the descriptions of what counts were simply nonsensical measurement qualifiers especially in the third year were copious newly enrolled girls were omitted from all analyses idinsight 2018 20 students dropped out a few schools closed some schools were dropped by the working group in year 3 after years 1 and 2 were less than promising the service provider increased remedial tutoring sessions for some students to twice a day along with home visits the service provider reported spending us 12 per student per year when less than us 5 per student was usually spent on students in that region brookings 2018 16 the point is not to belittle the measurements but to point out that behind the conclusion that dibs are successful lies sometimes dubious and often debatable data analysis decision making serious questions of long term population wide applicability and sustainability abound and are cause for concern for example who will educate students who do not measure up in any given year when investors only pay for success there is one more essential precursor in the pandemic bond s genealogy the rise of catastrophe bonds called cat bonds introduced in the mid 1990s cat bonds are bonds of one to three years sold by banks and purchased by private investors willing to hold the chance that an insurance company will have to pay out claims if a catastrophe happens investors make money when they hold the bond for an event that does not happen and that insurance companies do not pay out for natural disasters like hurricanes earthquakes wildfires meteorite impacts and volcanic eruptions fall into this category of investment device extreme mortality bonds were introduced in the mid 2000s to protect insurance companies against losing too much money to life insurance claims in the event of a catastrophe investors bet on bonds speculating on the where the magnitude and the timing of the catastrophe in june 2014 as the ebola pandemic raged the world bank had just issued its first cat bond raising us 30 million covering earthquakes and cyclones in sixteen caribbean countries although the bank was about twenty years late to the party its new cat bond was hailed as innovative and a milestone world bank 2014b the then president of the world bank jim kim took credit for putting the two the ebola pandemic and the cat bond model together aaa 2017 the pef with its catastrophe bond like device and a 50 million euro cash pot became a signature contribution of kim s tenure it is important to reckon with this part of the genealogy the pandemic bond grew out of a neoliberal milieu in which earlier precursors sibs dibs catastrophe and extreme mortality bonds were hailed as the remedy to bad slow government the pandemic bond is a manifestation of larger trends away from direct investment in health care systems infrastructure and toward pay for performance financing soucat et al 2017 and accountable care systems mcclellan et al 2014 never mind that governments have orchestrated astonishing public health improvements over the last 150 years rosling 2010 innovative global health financing eschews governments and making money on disease is considered a problem solving win win by many of the people i interviewed at the world bank i encountered a widespread embrace of development projects and products that provide return when i asked my interlocutors there about future developments and whether to expect a pandemic bond 2 0 one of them said that the pandemic bond 1 0 issuance was a test to see if it functioned as imagined it s proof of concept it s a pilot and we ll see how it goes to a large extent depends on whether the 1 0 triggers or not part of me is like i hope there isn t another public health outbreak with pandemic potential but another part of me says well until that happens we can t really test it in the summer of 2019 the world bank announced it is working on a pef 2 0 finance sociality relationships strengthened relationships forsaken the development of the bond portion of the pef was by many reports a creative iterative and exciting process for some it was completely nerve racking it was my life for two years a financial analyst said sounding both proud and exhausted a core group of officers from world bank departments treasury health and development finance developed the bond using various exemplars from successful green and catastrophe bond issuances as the pef developed the world bank brought in reinsurance companies a bond brokerage company and a data modeling company to structure the bond when it came time to solicit investors the world bank turned to a familiar bond broker the guy carpenter company a cat bond investor told me is a typical kind of investment banking relationship needs to turn to some expert who deals with us as investors every day knows the whole universe of investors who have bought bonds before what they re thinking who would care or not care that s their value to the world bank the whole universe of investors as it turns out is a rather stable group of people no mom and pop investors are allowed only institutional investors approved by the us security and exchange commission sec will do an sec accredited investor has to have earned at least us 200 000 in each of the prior two years and have a net worth over us 1 million banks partnerships corporations nonprofits and trusts may be accredited investors if their total assets exceed us 5 million or if all of the equity owners are sec accredited investors sec rules specify that an investor must be sophisticated meaning that the must have sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and business matters sec 2013 who is an accredited investor during an interview a world bank officer mentioned going on a roadshow to look for investors sle the roadshow i m sorry but i don t know what that would mean for the world bank to wb oh so that would just mean we went to some cities you know to london zurich tokyo new york where we spoke with the bond investors and explained to people who were potentially interested in investing in this pandemic bond we explained it to them sle and at any point did you seek investors or share the model in sierra leone liberia or guinea wb no we have a steering committee for that from the world bank s perspective the pandemic bond needs to work and to work it needs to draw the right kind of attention from the right people this meant getting investor buy in from wealthy established capital networks more than 80 percent of the investors covering the ebola portion of the pef are in europe with dedicated cat bond investors 35 percent and pension funds 42 percent making up the investor type artemis 2018b sierra leoneans liberians and guineans and people from other qualifying recipient countries are imagined only as the intended recipients of a pandemic payout they were not consulted in the making of the bond in 2016 about fifty senior health and national security officers from africa north america and europe met near london three g7 governments hosted the meeting to share lessons learned from the ebola outbreak i was invited to explain the financialization of ebola after i finished explaining how the pef works as a new form of pandemic financing a high ranking african officer immediately commented we re not in this i have never heard of this that officer and others around the room were visibly upset at issue was the lack of consultation with african leaders in the making of the bond later when i joined a lunch table where several country officers were eating and discussing the pandemic bond the general tone had shifted to one of resignation by the end of lunch i left the table with the impression that during a national emergency like the one posed by the west african ebola outbreak it did not matter much where the money came from just that some came but in a pandemic is it always the money that matters most this presumption begs reckoning with yes of course money is absolutely necessary to respond to pandemics but during the ebola outbreak nonfinancial factors also severely affected disease containment see wilkinson and leach 2014 shepler 2017 most of which were minimized in my findings when compared with the world bank s aggrandizement of the pef and what of the big development banks responsibilities for economic structuring failures in sierra leone those that stunted the growth of a health care system capable of thwarting early cases of ebola kentikelenis et al 2015 might the pandemic bond be part of a contemporary impact bond juggernaut that is a dramatic expansion of economic rationality and its penetration into new areas of human life when best practices like local consultation fall away in pursuit of capital cooper and konings 2015 2 making what global health becomes among the people i interviewed there was a widespread belief that the pef was a moral good and that the financial performance of the pandemic bond would set in motion the future conditions of global health in making the pandemic bond development banks reinsurance companies data analysis firms and investors aim to design anew what the field of global health becomes for centuries governments unceremoniously and often unprofitably held our collective disease security risks but now we are in an era of private takeover of and profit from that obligation the global financial powerhouses who made the pef believe the private sector should take over government tasks by their logic investors who buy the risk of a pandemic deserve to make money and they aim to cultivate a pandemic bond market that will establish and provide pandemic response financing in perpetuity they may be wrong but increasingly they hold the power to shape global health futures to their liking and advantage they design humanitarian devices structure processes and determine triggers they do this outside the realms of democratic processes without constituents constitutionally empowered to complain critique or improve reckoning with their imagined global health futures means reckoning with the neoliberal logics and metrics that are taking us there making the pandemic bond is not only about constructing a vehicle in which both investors and pandemic responders share the chance to make money it s also about constructing another capital market for investors including the reinsurance companies and development banks themselves to diversify their portfolios diversifying investment portfolios is a common investment strategy as different kinds of investments are not likely to lose money all at the same time an investor summed up for me the world bank s leadership role in the promotion of the pandemic bond market the bond relies heavily on the world bank without their credibility and stamp of approval on this it wouldn t have been issued so it s very important that everyone agree to what the deal is that they re entering because god forbid something happens everybody s got to be on the same page because otherwise the market doesn t grow the world bank understands that the market they are trying to cultivate with the pandemic bond is not something found out there but rather something that must be painstakingly constructed the bond s designers aim to catalyze the future conditions of a global health field that will be able to rely on capital markets for funding it took two years to develop the pef bond and it was created with the hope that it would create a new market a market for transferring the risks of outbreaks and pandemics from governments to private investors officially according to the world bank the pef is expected to play a key market development role by helping create a new market for pandemic risk insurance the private sector may take this forward on its own in a few years it is likely that over time as the market matures the pef will scale up and pricing will become more competitive as has been seen with catastrophe risk insurance facilities world bank 2016a iii the world bank is counting on the pandemic bond to perform well enough to establish a pandemic bond market much as the green and cat bond markets have over the last ten to twenty years the growth of the green bond market established a solid faith in development bonds but it was the catastrophe bond market that mechanism for investing in natural and climate disasters that set the sights and expectations for the pandemic bond market the cat bond market took about fifteen years to mature and stabilize now it is thriving valued at us 40 billion artemis 2019 as of 2 september 2019 pensions are invested in the cat bond market with regularity an investor pointed out from the investor perspective many years went by where there wasn t a loss in the cat bond market so that helped a lot if investors regularly lose the money they put into the pandemic bond the market will cease to exist and the pandemic bond will be considered a market failure but it is completely possible that pandemic bond devices may successfully yield profits that will build a market but not correlate to disease containment and improved health outcomes this is because only the data has to meet the contracted measures to profit much like dumit 2012 and sunder rajan 2012 found with pharmaceutical profiting well bodies and populations can become secondary in essence investors do not need to care about disease containment only about the data representing disease containment and if the pandemic bond performs and makes money for investors that success will spawn other instruments like it and a new market will be born speculative finance is now poised to catalyze what global health becomes caring about data that supports investor return may not necessarily correlate with well body outcomes we need to reckon with health data and health care systems that may soon need to be even more investor friendly many people say we can do both but let s interrogate that declaration starting with an examination of how the data that determines returns on the bond actually works reckoning the dead i of ii modelling ebola risk if there is a single element that could shake investors faith in the pandemic bond and undermine a future pandemic bond market it s the triggers the numbers the assignation of financial risk the counting of the dead it made sense when a world bank officer told me the investors asked a lot of questions about the data and the veracity of the data and the trigger because for them that s what matters the most the triggers took the most time to set up in conversations about the pandemic bond and ebola there was a lot of slippage between the 250 750 and 2 500 death triggers and the counting of the dead but they are not the same the triggers work on two registers this section takes up how risk is defined and assessed by modelers and how investors assess their financial risk via the triggers the next section takes account of how the dead are counted and not counted relative to the trigger thresholds the pandemic bond s parametric triggers were assessed relative to the risk of a pandemic for investors that is the risk that they would lose their money rather than the risk of pandemic for the people who would experience it data modelers hired by the world bank assess this risk statistically they start with retrospective who population health data and add data from other sources parametric measures are data points projected for a given population using historical inputs and conditions chosen by the data modelers it is a biostatistical exercise employing biostatistical conventions that include sampling and projection what data modelers bring to the project are models that help investors determine how risky the bond is that is the chance that they will lose their money this is central to the bond as a speculative enterprise one data modeler explained probabilistic modeling to me this way data modeler dm no one claims that whatever s presented is 100 percent representative of what s going to happen that s why we do five hundred thousand years because we want to consider all the feasibilities some things we can t see some things that are very severe some things that are less severe and that s why we do probabilistic modeling sle five hundred thousand years of modeling dm pick january 1 as your start date to december 31 what could happen from a pandemic or a large scale epidemic or something like that if you resimulate whole calendar year five hundred thousand times it s the same thing as if i roll the die five hundred thousand times you d have lots of outcomes of that you can run the probabilities many many many times until you see convergence that s why we selected five hundred thousand times to be able to figure out what might happen based on the historical data and possibilities that we have using the triggers as a guide investors figured out the chance that they would lose their money or make a profit the risk of death and therefore of financial loss is translated into financial risk for the investors details on this are deep in the fine print of the prospectus supplement also called the term sheet world bank 2017c appendix ii thinking about the triggers as absolute thresholds is misleading i was told because they are meant more as intermediaries as modes of thinking about risk a modeler explained with the outbreak bond you have the person selling the risk and the person buying the risk when we were on the investor roadshow we were not necessarily trying to sell them that the 250 is right or the 750 is right our objective is to say our model can estimate these various numbers with reasonable accuracy we operate as this third party thing trying to not be biased in one s favor or another we re trying to create what we believe is a reasonable estimate of the risks we have to just go with best available data to get there like the making of a market establishing a parametric trigger takes serious effort the modeler continued the parametric model is kind of a weird structure you could do a myriad of different ways that the structuring can get made and our objective is to give quantifiable risk against a lot of different assessments when they ask a question we might provide just that one oh you asked about a here s the risk or we might do a few different things and say here s a few options based on what you said or they might sometimes just say before we do a and b have at it and figure something out for us and then we ll come up with an option and then they ll look at it and then be like we wanted to do some more stuff around it then you do that kind of stuff so it s this back and forth process another modeler joked all the models are wrong but some of them are useful in the end data modelers used their pandemic risk model to help write conditions that were not likely to result in too much investor loss the world bank s 2017a 6 operations manual lists these conditions which need to be met before investors lose their money in an ebola outbreak event at least 12 weeks have passed from the start date of the event the outbreak is in more than one country with each country having greater than or equal to 20 confirmed deaths the growth rate of disease needs to be greater than zero to ensure that the outbreak is growing at a specific statistical confidence level the total confirmed death amount needs to be greater than or equal to 250 the rolling total case amount needs to be greater than or equal to 250 the rolling confirmed case amount needs to comprise a minimum percentage of the rolling total case amount regional outbreaks affecting two to seven countries would activate payments at three stages as the number of total confirmed deaths increases global outbreaks affecting eight or more countries also activate payments at three stages but at higher funding levels at the first two triggers in talk about the pandemic bond as a financial device there is regular and unself conscious slippage between risk to investors and risk to people who are likely to experience the disease many people i interviewed talked about the two kinds of risk as if they were one and the same when of course they are not a deep reckoning with the pandemic bond forces an essential confrontation for some people the stakes are about losing or gaining money for others the risks are death or long term disability the numeric triggers obscure that difference thereby creating another risk losing sight of which risks to prioritize reckoning the dead ii of ii taking account of the counts in world bank documents investor synopses and bond blogs the numeric triggers of the pandemic bond table 1 are characterized as clear cut and uninfluenced parametric triggers use publicly available and observable data to determine the payment amounts as these triggers are based on observable data they provide more transparency increase the speed of payment and allow for an objective benchmarking of risk bonds would be constructed around the same transparent and indisputable activation criteria world bank 2016a 13 14 what is striking in conversations about the pandemic bond with reinsurance data modeling and finance personnel is the enduring faith they place in the triggers even when data limits are acknowledged the prevailing sentiment was they re the best we ve got and we ve got to use something counting the dead is beset by a similar sensibility the pandemic bond uses counts published in who disease outbreak news or situation report and there is faith in that data when i interviewed one world bank manager of the bond i found that my knowledge of data collection in sierra leone was more granular than theirs wb it s data that who puts out who puts out those numbers in the moment sle by the month or wb no they take it in real time you should talk with the health team because they re the ones who gave us the assurance that who is doing this really in real time sle thank you yes i ll follow up in my research though i travel around with the people who collect the numbers for who i mean i know the guys who collect the numbers in sierra leone wb okay alright well i m a third party receiver of the numbers i don t know whether it is a suspected case or a probable case or a confirmed case i don t track that that s not my job it is who s job so we entrusted them with that responsibility that is the data that we go on there was sufficient comfort you know in the data the who provides during research in sierra leone in 2014 our team collected ethnographic data on how health data is generated in freetown the capital city of sierra leone and in small cities in the eastern and northern provinces we met with interviewed and observed the work of people involved with health data generation in the process we learned that sierra leonean freelance enumerators are the most significant group of data collectors in the country a cohort of mostly men and a few women in their twenties and thirties these enumerators work on short term contractual bases for any organization that needs numbers for example an enumerator is hired to collect data in twenty villages from people who suffer from a disease their job is to travel to these villages in for example two weeks time collect disease data and usually fill in a survey on a smart phone or tablet that may sound straightforward but in actual practice it is not it s precarious wage labor complicated by language in sierra leone there are about twenty different languages spoken in an area the size of scotland and further by work schedules often put together by people who have never been to sierra leone or driven on its roads see images in figure 2 nor do they understand the precarious rhythms of labor and labor mobility during the dry and rainy seasons collecting health data in sierra leone is physically and socially demanding work and during an epidemic be it cholera measles or ebola even more so one enumerator described the challenge the last time i went to kailahun district i walked twenty one miles to go to a village and twenty one miles to come back when you go to the field your very first problem is how far it is just imagine walking twenty one miles to go and twenty one to come back and you have four villages to cover another sierra leonean enumerator mentioned similarly enumerators

travis lupik both used with permission to enhance data security employers track enumerators via the global positioning system gps in their phones there is not always enough time to complete all the villages assigned and do all the paperwork one enumerator s statement summarizes what several others also said i have heard that sometimes people will send their smart phones with lorry or motorcycle drivers to a village while they fill out the questionnaire because there is just not enough time to do everything they want see also kingori and gerrets and biruk on the moralities and realities of data fabrication by fieldworkers but there are risks to this strategy as noted by another enumerator the last time i went gave us pdas to know if we went to the communities they knew the gps coordinates of the village so now you have the questionnaire and also a gps now they detect you if they detect that you have not gone they will send you back there and maybe charge you with the full punishment of the law for giving them wrong information they will retrieve your money they paid you certainty about the health data down to the last digit is not possible investors potentially will lose money when the official data show 250 people dead responding agencies and countries potentially get money for the same yet 249 deaths yield dramatically different results people on both sides of the ledger are hedging their bets ministry officials in sierra leone have told me that they need bad numbers to get foreign assistance i found in earlier research that one of the ways they accomplish this is by not collecting health data from clinics known for their good outcomes on the investor side deflating death rate data would be as easy as hiring enumerators for more lucrative work thereby delaying data collection or hacking into smart phones to alter data there are many creative ways to play with data triggers if that s what stands between money for investors or money for receiving countries so much money is riding on the counts that i too must reckon with the potential impacts of my research an investor told me if the event happens and investors feel like it wasn t fairly calculated or there was some monkey business going on then the market isn t going to be around for long my work pulls back the curtain to show how the data is collected counted analyzed and applied will the real time wobbliness of the data deter potential investors will it derail the pef maybe in the investor worlds i entered though i found that investors are mostly agnostic they go where the money is to be made if not with pandemic bonds 1 0 then maybe with 2 0 or 3 0 or they will go elsewhere completely this is another risk to reckon with in a possible future where pandemic risk management has been turned over to capital markets after government aid drops to historic lows how will pandemics be funded if investors flee insuring futures whose for some time now the performance and even the viability of the world bank has been in question no friend of the bank the financial times regularly questions its relevance see for example financial times 2014 along with other powerful north american and european international development and finance establishments the development economist jeffery sachs 2012 argues that the world bank has lacked a clear direction solved far too few global problems and completely fumbled the exploding pandemics of aids tuberculosis and malaria during the 1990s in a more recent article in which he took a direct swipe at the world bank s wall street and davos leanings sachs 2018 pointedly praised funding that used outright grants not wall street loans fighting aids in poor countries was not viewed as a revenue generating investment needing fancy financial engineering likewise an article in the new york times explored the link between the world bank s organizational viability and private investor profit in a search for relevance the bank s president is altering its approach he is pushing private investors sovereign wealth funds private equity firms and insurance companies to pony up trillions of dollars for projects they can reap rich returns by putting their money to work alongside the world bank thomas 2018 reckoning with the pandemic bond means sorting out who has what to gain from its success as a financial device in early 2015 the world bank invited some of the largest reinsurance companies in the world to help build the pandemic bond a world bank interlocutor told me several expressed interest and we had conversations with them but then ultimately they started dropping out i mean at that time we didn t know what the pef would look like but we said we were interested in partnering with the private sector to put together some sort of mechanism that will help insure countries against the next disease ultimately there were just two that remained interested they had some comfort in working with the bank because they also worked with the bank on the cat bonds i was told that the world bank paid out about us 1 million to build the pandemic bond and that the reinsurance companies worked pro bono because they were very interested in developing the pandemic bond instrument since the 2017 pef bond initial offering they have already made us 37 million per year on pef bond premiums one economist told me that the reinsurance companies involved in the pef are expecting to make over 100 million on the pandemic bond premiums alone they have a lot more to gain financially if a pandemic bond market becomes established along the lines of the green and cat bond models reinsurers were in it to develop and influence a market that they would be able later to invest in their financial security and profit depend on them being able to diversify their own portfolios and spread around their own risk much as they have done in the cat bond market a reinsurance executive bluntly explained that just making the pandemic bond alone would not have been worth it the amount of effort that we had to invest into it it was very long and intensive time of work with many many experts involved lots of discussions going on it s only worth it against the hope that this effort would create a new market otherwise the costs involved in developing these types of solutions would be too high but a well known european economist familiar with the pandemic bond s mechanics put the reinsurance companies interest in a different light it really doesn t make much sense when the world s resources for health care for people in poor countries are very scarce so adopting the design where half the money on average goes to an insurance company is kind of crazy dead reckoning dead reckoning is a navigational method that uses known plot points to set a direction blowditch 2002 it is an apt metaphor for anticipating whether pandemic bonds will establish and continue what has the pandemic bond launched is turning back possible given the years in the making the socialities between the world bank the bond brokers the donor countries and the reinsurance and data companies and these parties investments of time and money and all the favors asked all the chits called in and all the objections overcome to make the device to set the stage for a new market to get the job done i ask is the future of pandemic response aid open or do the creation and the processes of the pandemic bond foreclose alternatives could pandemic security be returned to governments is it stubborn naïveté to continue to imagine worlds where investments in good government produce less financially motivated care could the bond as a global health finance device ever fail completely given that there is so much from the so powerful at stake is there an equivalent here to too big to fail too much time spent too many favors too many promises too many concessions too much exchange can any level of reckoning undo the bond making double entendre intended of the pandemic bond the ethical stakes of this reckoning ratcheted up a notch when the world bank invited the reinsurance industry to the pandemic bond design process the insurance industry s role in black atlantic capitalism in the eighteenth century and its production of interest bearing bodies is instructive baucom 2005 tells of a british merchant vessel the zong that sailed the atlantic ocean in 1781 en route to jamaica with 440 west africans who would be sold as slaves in caribbean slave markets the ship went off course extending the voyage food and water ran low to compensate and knowing he could claim insurance for lost cargo the captain directed that 132 men women and children from west africa be thrown overboard a premeditated mass murder at sea when the ship arrived in jamaica its captain and owners claimed loss of insured property at 30 per person the insurers refused to pay the captain and owner sued the insurers were ordered to pay the case was taken for appeal in a higher court whose chief justice was intent on building england s economy through his insurance law project krikler 2007 35 the judge had found english commercial law inadequate to the task of improving the efficiency of a burgeoning capitalism and ensuring the security of property and the integrity of business transactions including the slave trade krikler 2007 42 eschewing murder charges the judge upheld the insurance contract by the late eighteenth century british insurance companies were insuring marine contracts including covering ships carrying enslaved africans worth around 100 000 000 a year which would be billions of pounds today krikler 2007 32 britain s shipping industry and navy are widely considered essential to england s nineteenth and early twentieth century capital accumulation and domination the association between insurance and profit for some who uses insurance for what why and how much is a historied and racist one when i learned of the 2018 ebola outbreak in the drc my involuntary first thought was of the number dead and whether the pandemic bond had been triggered for aid i checked the numbers the death data hadn t triggered the bond investors did not lose their money two weeks after the first ebola cases in the drc were confirmed the pef cash pot mechanism not the pandemic bond kicked in in may 2018 us 12 million from the cash pot was disbursed the world bank congratulated itself for moving the dial away from panic and neglect evans 2018 it took credit for the money being there at the ready another us 20 million was disbursed in february 2019 us 10 million more was disbursed in may 2019 deaths mounted but no matter how many people die in a single country the pandemic bond money cannot contractually be released as aid until the disease crosses the country s border a colleague wrote to me saw the pef numbers are at trigger level but still waiting for the border jump what a bizarre and twisted situation then in june 2019 ebola was confirmed in uganda but for the bond to trigger there are still more conditions there must be at least twenty deaths and the growth rate threshold must be met in august 2019 us 300 million was released for ebola care from the cash window and other world bank accounts two thousand dead and still the bond did not trigger i continue to track the death data from the drc outbreak and reckon with the role of the data just as i continue to reckon with the bond i am skeptical i am not there in the congo i do not know if more people may have died only to elude count i am not privy to the conversations in the ministries or to the whisperings of community members i am not hanging out with the enumerators do they have gasoline for their motorcycles are they allowed into villages where people are dying from ebola what kind of data collection schedules are they on and then i catch myself the death data is both the mainstage and the sideshow in the pef schematic splitting off data from the actual health of populations is normal practice now erikson 2012 and care need not even be delivered for a financial device to succeed counting the dead has long been a political act of states and now it is becoming a special interest of global financiers are pandemic and development impact bonds the future of global health and humanitarian aid all things considered maybe they are and if they are let s prepare and reckon with how we as a global community will pay for care during pandemics and other crisis events if investors flee and governments can t or won t pay is this the future we want let s reckon with this now before the global health bond slot becomes a financial juggernaut government coffers atrophy further and pandemic problem solving becomes more circumscribed

progressive taxes make good neighbors photo elijah nouvelage getty images a cosmopolitan elite is eroding the integrity of america s borders and the sovereignty of its citizens this numerically small but economically powerful band of globe trotters use their outsize political influence to preempt popular policies that they don t like or else sabotage the enforcement of those they can t block the resulting lawlessness and illicit cross border flows beggar middle class taxpayers and strain the finances of our welfare state and everyone who dares to object to this state of affairs or to demand a crackdown on those who flout our nation s laws and make a mockery of its claims to self governance are derided as naïve know nothing demagogues or worse you ve heard this story before donald trump and his allies have deployed variations on it to demonize undocumented immigrants and cast their xenophobic movement as a populist majoritarian cause whose only real opposition is a cabal of unpatriotic elites and yet virtually all of the right s non explicitly white nationalist complaints about our government s failure to enact and enforce restrictions on internationally mobile labor ring far truer when applied to internationally mobile capital this reality is reflected in the current debate over wealth taxes critics of elizabeth warren and bernie sanders s schemes for soaking the superrich have martialed a variety of arguments against them but the most prominent is an appeal to fatalism even if annual levies on great fortunes or confiscatory top income tax rates were desirable the u s government would remain incapable of effectively enforcing them a wide variety of economists and billionaires have offered versions of this warning you finally have some politicians who are so extreme that i d say no that s even beyond bill gates recently said qualifying his support for stiffer taxes on his class you do start to create tax dodging and disincentives and an incentive to have the income show up in other countries and things this argument asks americans to accept a stark limitation on their nation s sovereignty it stipulates that in a world of globally mobile capital the effective limit on top tax rates is set by our superrich not our democratic polity why this diminution of the nation state s authority should be acceptable even as a minuscule amount of undocumented immigration is regarded as a crisis of the rule of law is difficult to explain there have been times in american history when immigration restriction was a popular cause but we re not living in one according to gallup s most recent polling only 27 percent of americans believe that immigration levels should be reduced by contrast elizabeth warren s plan to levy a 2 percent wealth tax on households worth over 50 million commands 61 percent approval in politico morning consult s polling with a large plurality of republicans endorsing the idea public support for alexandria ocasio cortez s 70 percent top marginal tax rate is similarly robust and yet such steeply progressive tax policies are widely considered politically untenable and logistically unenforceable largely because of the outsize political influence and innovative unlawfulness of the cosmopolitan elites who bankroll the republican party the costs of our government s inability to police every inch of our 1 933 mile border with mexico and thus perfectly enforce our legal restrictions on labor mobility are miniscule if not nonexistent far from burdening middle class taxpayers and straining the welfare state s capacity undocumented immigrants contribute an estimated 13 billion to social security and 3 billion to medicare each year despite their ineligibility for those programs benefits meanwhile america s undocumented population also increases our nation s productive capacity and thus the size of the economic pie that can be diverted to publicly beneficial ends these facts combined with the undocumenteds greater propensity for abiding by our nation s laws means that the imperfections in our immigration enforcement system have gifted our country a lower crime rate higher economic growth and a smaller federal deficit by contrast the costs of uncle sam s failure to enforce existing taxes on the rich let alone to enact rates commensurate with popular preferences have been exorbitant by the irs s estimates tax evasion costs the federal government roughly 450 billion in lost revenue every year much of this is achieved through underreporting but a good chunk is attributable to the illicit movement of wealth across borders globally upwards of 6 trillion in untaxed earnings are stowed away in tax havens according to the estimates of economist gabriel zucman a leading authority on the subject the one percent s refusal to abide by our nation s tax laws is all the more remarkable given how much influence they ve exercised over their content for decades a large majority of the american public has said that taxes on the rich are too low and yet policymakers have bucked that consensus with republican administrations reducing the tax burdens of the rich by far more than their democratic successors have increased them in 1980 america s wealthiest 400 families paid an average effective tax rate of 47 percent today that figure is 23 percent which is slightly lower than the average rate paid by those in the bottom half of america s income ladder the dollar s privileged status as the global reserve currency combined with persistently low interest rates has mitigated the consequences of our inability to subject the superrich to progressive taxation instead of fully offsetting the costs of tax breaks for billionaires with cuts to social spending uncle sam has been free to run higher and higher deficits but demagogy about the national debt has still forced bouts of austerity and persistent underinvestment in social programs and infrastructure that would benefit ordinary americans meanwhile in the absence of robust federal funding for various state level programs many states have steadily increased taxes on their poor in sum just about everything conservatives say about immigration policy and enforcement in the u s applies with much greater force to tax policy and enforcement our inability to hold internationally mobile capitalists accountable to our lenient tax laws undermines one of the most basic aspects of national sovereignty the freedom to democratically determine our polity s distribution of economic rights and responsibilities and does so in a manner that materially harms ordinary americans happily a few on the right are beginning to understand this the latest issue of american affairs a policy journal founded by a trump supporter who wished to add some intellectual sinew to the skeletal frame of the mogul s nationalist ideology features an excellent meditation on tax sovereignty in the age of global capital in the essay michael cuenco a graduate student at the munk school of global affairs and public policy articulates some of the arguments i ve outlined above while endorsing a far more sophisticated conception of national sovereignty than one is used to encountering in a conservative publication drawing on the work of the political philosopher and economist peter dietsch cuenco argues that the westphalian concept of national sovereignty defined by the illegitimacy of one state interfering in another s internal affairs has become outmoded in an age of footloose capital in an economically interdependent world the extremes of tax competition and the absence or relative weakness of tax cooperation mean that as countries struggle to preserve their westphalian sovereignty through strategic attempts at attracting and retaining globally mobile capital arbitrage becomes possible and the erosion of results dietsch proposes that as things are westphalian sovereignty is no longer adequate or even logically possible if the policies of affect other states in ways that although not directly exercising authority over their policies nevertheless indirectly undermine the effectiveness of these policies then westphalian sovereignty is compromised furthermore the continuing rise in capital mobility might necessitate new forms of institutional cooperation between states that could further conflict with the ideal of westphalian sovereignty dietsch makes a comparison with individual liberty and appeals to the idea that sovereignty just as much as liberty entails not only rights but obligations dietsch is thus able to formulate tax sovereignty as having a twofold conditional nature consisting of a state s right to fiscal self determination bundled with a responsibility to respect the fiscal self determination of other states in other words safeguarding america s national sovereignty and building effective institutions of global governance are not conflicting objectives the second is a precondition for the first in the absence of an international system for monitoring and policing cross border capital flows no nation can exercise genuine sovereignty over its own fiscal policy fortunately constructing such a system is well within our collective capacity in fact we ve already broken ground on the project as cuenco notes one need look no further than the united states which is already far ahead in getting other nations to respect its fiscal self determination in 2010 the united states unilaterally imposed the foreign accounts tax compliance act fatca that requires foreign financial institutions ffis to submit the financial accounts information of american citizens and resident taxpayers to the internal revenue service with the threat of a 30 percent withholding tax on u s source income to be imposed on ffis that fail to comply this historic piece of legislation and its global consequences serve as a concrete example of a state demanding that other states recognize its sovereign right to collect revenue from its tax base albeit in a rather heavy handed way by compelling foreign actors to provide assistance to its revenue agency more could be done to improve fatca but it s a start one can envision a near future where sovereign states are endowed with newfound fiscal capacities and powers of enforcement that would allow them to effectively track and tax the globally mobile segments of their tax base america s power on the world stage may be in decline but between our coveted consumer and financial markets and military supremacy we retain a lot of leverage over how global commerce is conducted if a sanders or warren administration chose to make the restoration of fiscal sovereignty a top tier priority of its foreign policy the superrich s taxable assets would have nowhere to hide or at least fewer places to hide some of the logistical challenges of wealth taxation might persist but the ceiling on how much revenue our government could realistically extract from the tiny fraction of its citizens who ve been hoarding the gains of economic growth would rise meteorically to this point progressives have largely framed their tax plans as measures for combating inequality and advancing economic justice and these are surely potent themes but truly comprehensive tax reform and the revamped enforcement apparatus it would entail would also represent a reassertion of the rule of law and the sovereignty of our nation state trump s republican party meanwhile exists to subordinate such sovereignty to the whims of its globe trotting benefactors sanders and warren might be wise to point that out
the issue providing clean water and sanitation will be one of the greatest global challenges over the next decade due to population growth and urbanization today 785 million people lack access to clean drinking water and over 2 billion lack access to a toilet 1 2 today 785 million people lack access to clean drinking water and over 2 billion lack access to a toilet additional sources of finance are needed in order to reduce the investment gap for water and sanitation programs the world bank estimates that current investment levels will need to at least triple in order to meet sustainable development goal 6 which aims to ensure that people in all countries have access to sustainable water and sanitation 3 the world bank estimates that current investment levels will need to at least triple in order to meet sustainable development goal 6 which aims to ensure that people in all countries have access to sustainable water and sanitation through development agencies like usaid and opic the united states can leverage additional private capital and increase the efficiency of existing water and sanitation programs reducing conflicts over water and ensuring stability in developing countries benefits u s development security and economic interests abroad introduction gaining access to potable water has been a challenge in developing countries for centuries according to the global risks 2015 report by the world economic forum global water crises are the biggest threat facing the planet over the next decade 4 globally 785 million people still lack even basic drinking water services and at least 2 billion people are using drinking water sources that have been contaminated with feces 5 as a result 485 000 people die each year from diarrheal diseases related to contaminated drinking water 6 cities in particular have found it difficult to provide drinking water and sewage systems for their residents as urban populations skyrocket and groundwater runs dry according to the world bank around 4 billion people live in urban areas accounting for over 50 percent of the global population 7 of these urban residents 500 million live in coastal areas that are subject to flooding and contaminated ground water as a result of saltwater intrusion which causes increased cases of diarrhea cholera and malaria 8 9 there are two competing challenges 1 the demand for clean drinking water is increasing as the global population soars and 2 fresh water resources are increasingly scarce development programs focused on water sanitation and hygiene wash have gradually shifted from rural areas to focus more heavily on urban contexts as well according to the un inequalities in the access and cost of wash services are most prevalent in urban areas 10 the challenges to delivering potable water and providing adequate sanitation facilities in cities include poor quality infrastructure scarce natural resources pollution and high cost of transportation the u s agency for international development usaid found that poor access to sanitation and hygiene costs the global economy approximately 220 billion per year 11 water sewage system in monrovia liberia source christopher metzger august 2018 many cities around the world have been forced to support populations with millions more people than ever intended originally constructed in 1824 monrovia the capital of liberia now has to provide public services like clean water sanitation and housing for over 1 5 million residents 12 building new infrastructure for water and sewage systems in cities like monrovia can be extremely difficult as many of the existing underground water distribution networks were built using wooden or lead pipes and are difficult to map maintenance for some systems has been deferred for years leading many to be at risk of collapsing in the next few years in addition vulnerable groups such as women low income families and refugees are more affected by issues related to water and sanitation in urban areas than others women are often responsible for collecting water for the household and spend an estimated 200 million hours every day collecting water 13 lower income families in urban areas have less access to services and are often forced to pay 10 to 20 times more than their more affluent neighbors for wash services because the utilities in low income areas are poorly managed 14 exacerbating the problem many of these residents are not included in the official service statistics because they do not pay taxes and their housing arrangements are part of the informal economy 15 many of the challenges related to clean water and sanitation can be linked to pollution and climate change big metropolitan areas are often built over existing water sources and along the coast allowing trash chemicals human water and saltwater to contaminate groundwater india is one example of a country where rapid urbanization and demographic changes have contaminated and depleted the country s natural water systems according to india s central pollution control board 63 percent of the sewage flowing into rivers in urban areas every day is left untreated 16 as a result 70 percent of india s water has become contaminated and india s water quality ranked 120 out of 122 countries according to niti aayog an indian think tank 17 some have even gone as far as to claim that 21 major cities in india will run out of groundwater by 2020 which would affect around 100 million people 18 dramatic steps need to be taken now in order to protect what groundwater remains for the future another place that exemplifies the challenges associated with providing urban water is jakarta the capital of indonesia which is home to over 10 5 million people 19 jakarta is sinking faster than any other big city on the planet mainly due to its citizens digging illegal wells for groundwater due to the scarcity of drinking water 20 the new york times estimated that about 40 percent of jakarta was below sea level in 2017 and some of the coastal districts have sunk as much as 14 feet in recent years 21 as a result of the city sinking infrastructure has suffered roads have been destroyed pipelines contaminated and rivers polluted especially in the north of the city closest to the java sea jakarta is prone to flooding which spreads diseases from contaminated groundwater septic tanks and improperly disposed sewage according to the financial times if the current rate of sinking continues 95 percent of north jakarta will be underwater by 2050 affecting 1 8 million people 22 even further 96 percent of jakarta s population does not have a wastewater system dumping waste and sewage directly into the ground or into septic tanks that contaminate groundwater 23 the situation has grown so bad that president joko widodo has decided to move the capital to the east kalimantan province on the island of borneo 24 on april 30 2019 president joko widodo announced in java the population is 57 percent of the total for indonesia or more than 140 million to the point that the ability to support this whether in terms of the environment water or traffic in the future will no longer be possible so i decided to move outside of java 25 jakarta is sinking faster than any other big city on the planet mainly due to its citizens digging illegal wells for groundwater due to the scarcity of drinking water action for water and sanitation access despite these challenges global progress is being made to provide access to clean water and sanitation for everyone one of the un s 17 sustainable development goals sdgs is specifically on water goal 6 calls nations to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all sdg sections 6 1 and 6 2 aim to achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end open defecation by 2030 paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations 26 many of the sdgs especially goal 9 industry innovation and infrastructure goal 11 sustainable cities and communities goal 13 climate action and goal 14 life below water cannot be achieved without also addressing the challenge of clean water and sanitation in order to achieve the sdgs countries around the world must further strengthen these efforts to provide sustainable drinking water and sanitation services for their populations figure 1 sdg 6 clean water and sanitation source data from sustainable development goal 6 united nations un water was established in 2003 to help coordinate the water and sanitation programs across 30 un organizations un water played an important role in making sdg 6 a priority in the 2030 agenda for sustainable development the 2015 2030 sendai framework for disaster risk reduction the 2015 addis ababa action agenda on financing for development and the 2015 paris agreement within the un convention framework on climate change 27 28 29 30 un water has also raised the profile of water and sanitation issues by celebrating world water day on march 22 and world toilet day on november 19 each year as a result of the sdgs and widespread attention to the problem the proportion of the people globally using safely managed drinking water services increased from 61 to 71 percent from 2000 to 2017 and the proportion using safely managed sanitation services increased from 28 to 45 percent over the same period 31 however these numbers do not tell the full story since access to water and sanitation differs greatly by region for example only 24 percent of the population of sub saharan africa had access to safe drinking water in 2015 and only 28 percent had basic sanitation facilities that are not shared with other households 32 according to the glaas 2019 report by un water and the who 20 countries and territories reported a funding gap of 61 percent between identified needs and available funding to reach national wash targets 33 in addition to the work done by multilateral organizations the united states has been a leader on supporting clean water and sanitation in developing countries for years figure 2 number of individuals gaining access by year source data from usaid s annual water and development reports through the water for the world act of 2014 and the water for the poor act of 2005 box 1 the united states has prioritized wash programs which have been mainly implemented by usaid the state department and the millennium challenge corporation mcc in fy 2017 usaid invested 449 6 million in water sanitation and hygiene activities in 41 countries 34 from fy 2008 to fy 2017 usaid s programs helped 42 million people gain access to an improved drinking water service and 27 2 million gain access to improved sanitation service 35 usaid s level of funding for water and sanitation has remained relatively consistent over the past few years usaid s partnerships with the private sector donors academia and host country governments on wash programs accounted for over 103 million in 2016 36 this does not include local private capital leveraged through guarantees from usaid s development credit authority dca or projects like the philippines water revolving fund the financial institutions reform and expansion debt and infrastructure fire d project in india suwasa in africa and wash fin see below which have additionally mobilized hundreds of millions of dollars other u s government efforts include those by the department of treasury which supported for example the 2017 local currency municipal bond in pune india for 24 7 water service provision 37 launched in october 2016 the usaid water sanitation and hygiene finance wash fin project aims to close financing gaps and improve governance structures that enable countries to become self reliant by accessing reliable sources of capital for sustainable climate resilient water and sanitation infrastructure 38 implementation of the project is led by tetra tech with support from open capital advisors segura consulting and global credit rating 39 wash fin works with national governments development partners private capital market institutions service providers and local governments and community stakeholders in eight countries 40 usaid should continue to support wash fin and look to build on its early success in leveraging additional financing for sustainable water and sanitation solutions box 1 u s legislation on global water strategies following unanimous consent in both the u s house of representatives and senate the senator paul simon water for the world act was signed into law on december 19 2014 under president barack obama 41 the law s two main points are 1 water and sanitation are critically important resources that impact many aspects of human life and 2 the united states should be a global leader in helping provide sustainable access to clean water and sanitation for the world s most vulnerable populations 42 by investing in better water and sanitation services the united states hopes to decrease the number of child deaths reduce poverty and boost the number of girls attending schools 43 more than 75 ngos and various other faith based organizations supported this legislation 44 the water for the world act requires that the united states produce a global water strategy every five years starting october 1 2017 and ending october 1 2027 45 the 2017 global water strategy laid out a framework for how usaid the state department and development agencies could improve water and sanitation conditions around the world the objectives include promoting sustainable access to drinking water and sanitation services encouraging the adoption of key hygiene behaviors propagating sound management of freshwater resources reducing conflicts over shared waters and strengthening water sector governance financing and institutions 46 the 2017 global water strategy states that our vision is a water secure world where people have sustainable supplies of water of sufficient quantity and quality to meet human economic and ecosystems needs while managing risks from floods and droughts 47 the law built off the success of the senator paul simon water for the poor act of 2005 which had required the secretary of state in consultation with the usaid administrator to submit a report every year from 2006 to 2014 updating congress on the progress made toward tackling water and sanitation issues 48 this law established the provision of safe drinking water sanitation and hygiene as a priority for u s foreign policy opportunities for financing water and sanitation the un general assembly and the human rights council first recognized the human right to access safe drinking water as part of binding international law in 2010 49 the human right to access sanitation was explicitly recognized as a distinct right by the un general assembly in 2015 50 this has led to a debate among international organizations about whether drinking water should be considered free since it is a human right in 2009 catarina de albuquerque un special rapporteur at the time said that water can have a price as long as people are not excluded and encouraged the private sector to have a role 51 most urban water systems in developing countries fall under the responsibility of national and local governments and lack sustainable financing traditional wash financing comes from a number of sources including tariffs and fees paid by the wash users domestic tax revenues passed from the central or local governments to the wash sector and grants from international donors charitable foundations and non governmental organizations interested in supporting the sector 52 investing in clean water and sanitation offers significant returns for development actors a report by the who found that the benefit cost ratio was 5 5 and 2 0 for improved sanitation and drinking water respectively 53 yet many cities are dependent on outside development actors to support services and fee collection remains an issue for many local governments and municipalities funding from ngos and foreign governments is neither sufficient nor sustainable and efforts should be focused on strengthening developing countries capacities to manage and finance their own urban water systems a lack of funding and financing is a critical bottleneck to achieving the sdg wash targets for vulnerable groups luis andrés and ye rin um of the world bank54 traditional methods of development finance will not be enough to achieve universal access to water and sanitation systems for the first time since 2011 official development assistance for wash declined in 2017 to 4 9 billion 55 development partners in the wash sector have identified a lack of blended finance and an inadequate amount of resources focused on the poorest and most vulnerable groups as the main challenges 56 the world bank estimates that the annual cost of meeting the first two targets of sdg 6 would require 114 billion each year which is about three times the current investment levels 57 this number does not include the cost of operating and maintaining the infrastructure over time 58 development finance institutions dfis can incentivize local private capital through financial institutions and spur domestic and international private companies to invest in water and sanitation systems by reducing the financial risk involved with investments blended finance aims to crowd in private capital by managing transferring or mitigating the risk inherent or perceived in the developing world while also producing a return and creating jobs and growth through investments that would otherwise not exist 59 for large scale projects dfis like the overseas private investment corporation opic which will soon become the u s international development finance corporation dfc and include usaid s dca guarantees program could offer specialized financial products such as loan guarantees direct lending and possibly equity for water and sanitation finance including in local currency the first usaid partial credit guarantees issued in 1999 were for wash and usaid has since provided dca guarantees to utilities municipalities companies and finance facilities for commercial bank loans and bonds for wash these transactions are typically tied to technical support and a bilateral assistance project to ensure bankable investments are developed and the guarantee is utilized in order to provide these guarantees opic must identify a financial institution with interest and liquidity after which opic backs up the investment per project opic can typically guarantee up to 250 million 60 in 2018 opic entered into a contract with befsea desalination developments ghana limited a company in accra ghana looking to upgrade their reverse osmosis desalination plant by desalinating seawater the plant is able to provide cleaner and more sanitary water for residents around accra opic agreed to provide 50 million in loans and guarantees for up to 18 years for the project 61 there is also significant demand for loans and financing toward small scale household solutions to water and sanitation issues such as water filtration systems the bill and melinda gates foundation reports that there is a 12 billion demand for affordable financing that could help 565 million people gain access to quality wash systems 62 increasing the amount of financing available to citizens in low and middle income countries will allow them to take out loans in order to purchase toilets and water purification systems for their homes one of the leaders in providing these microfinance solutions is water org box 2 through the watercredit initiative and waterequity platform water org has provided more than 21 million people in africa asia and latin america with safe water and sanitation 63 every dollar invested in watercredit creates 59 worth of impact 64 box 2 microfinance solutions offered by water org and waterequity water org has a long history of providing grants for microfinancing institutions to improve water and sanitation systems in households originally founded in 2009 by gary white and matt damon water org starts by identifying a region that is in need of microfinancing and carefully selecting local institutions to partner with and help establish water and sanitation loans in their portfolio of offerings 65 through the watercredit initiative water org provides technical assistance connections and resources so that these local microfinance partners can provide small and affordable loans that can be used to put a tap or toilet in households 66 waterequity was launched in 2017 by water org as an independent non profit focused heavily on investing in microfinancing institutions and mobilizing capital in low and middle income countries to end the global water crisis 67 matt damon and gary white were inspired to launch waterequity after seeing that the vast number of families in need of 200 300 loans were overwhelming lenders capacity 68 these loans could be used to buy a household s first ever toilet or install a water catchment systems in march 2019 waterequity officially closed the 50 million watercredit investment fund 3 wcif3 which invests in microfinance institutions as well as small sanitation related businesses in india 45 percent cambodia 30 percent indonesia 20 percent and the philippines 5 percent 69 70 the fund offers high net worth investors financial institutions and foundations a modest target return of 3 5 percent over its seven year term and aims to provide 4 6 million people with safe water and sanitation at the same time 71 to be safe 5 million in first loss guarantees were set aside in the unlikely scenario that the fund suffers a loss 72 investors in the fund include opic bank of america conrad n hilton the skoll foundation and niagara bottling 73 as of july 2019 wcif3 had completed seven loans to microfinance institutions resulting in 60 000 microloans to families living in poverty 93 percent of the borrowers were women 74 the fund also had a significant impact with 224 100 people gaining access to sanitation and 39 700 people gaining access to water 75 every dollar invested in watercredit creates 59 worth of impact going forward recommendations for u s agencies the united states remains a global leader on water and sanitation issues this does not mean that it is exempt from the challenges of supplying clean drinking water as seen through the water crisis in flint michigan 76 many historic cities in the united states suffer from outdated underground water distribution systems and contaminated groundwater for example over 80 percent of new orleans 1 500 miles of water pipes were installed at least 80 years ago and are under threat of saltwater intrusion 77 st petersburg florida is another city where rain and flooding has overwhelmed stormwater systems forcing the city to pump partially treated sewage into tampa bay boca ciega bay and the clam bayou nature preserve 78 federal state and municipal governments should work to build more resilient cities increased flooding growing urban populations and saltwater intrusion along coastal towns will only exacerbate the challenges to providing sustainable wash systems in cities driven by climate change and unpredictable weather water and sanitation challenges are becoming more and more difficult to address and the united states must remain committed to strengthening wash systems at home and abroad if the united states limits its engagement to just domestic efforts wash systems in cities around the world will deteriorate beyond repair and contribute to increased global instability through the water for the world act the united states has demonstrated its commitment to supporting clean water and sanitation services abroad increasing access to capital for wash programs in developing countries saves lives helps strengthen the resilience of cities and reduces dependency on donor agencies reducing fragility in developing countries also supports u s security and economic interests abroad 1 mobilize private capital to support increased water and sanitation in cities in order to address the 114 billion in financing needed scarce resources from the public sector must leverage private capital to crowd in all available forms of funding and financing 79 ideally the private capital mobilized will be from dfis and capital markets and in local currency this is more sustainable for practical reasons as it engages local institutions and also for financial reasons as local currency debt is better matched to the revenues of the service providers and does not carry foreign exchange risk there may be an opportunity to engage further with local pension funds looking for low risk long term investments dfis should play a bigger role in crowding in capital for wash systems when opic transforms into the new dfc it should use the new investment tools at its disposal to support urban water infrastructure projects opic was a debt investor for the wcif3 blended finance fund but through the 2018 build act the new dfc will have the capacity to make debt and equity investments including in local currency offering a new opportunity to further leverage private sector financing 80 81 the dfc can benefit from the connection with usaid and the dca legacy as the dfc has a mandate to deliver results in the least developed countries partnering with bilateral and multilateral dfis can help alleviate risks and costs increasing access to capital for people in low and middle income countries will allow households the ability to purchase their first toilets and tap water systems microfinancing is another way to expand the amount of private capital available for households to get the loans they desperately need and on favorable terms dfis like opic should continue to support funds like waterequity s watercredit investment fund 3 through debt financing and equity investments partnering with other dfis through co investments also gives a certain level of credibility to investment opportunities because investors know that the u s government is supporting the fund so far 99 percent of watercredit s cumulative loans have been paid back 82 2 increase the efficiency and improve the performance of wash systems part of bridging the finance gap should also be to increase the efficiency and performance of existing water and sanitation systems building new infrastructure is needed in many instances but many of the problems that utility providers face are related to management and governance service providers struggle with collection or lose money due to non revenue water from spills or leaks strengthening urban water systems should be a part of smart cities initiatives and leverage new technologies when appropriate cities wash systems could be greatly improved by access to reliable data and information seeing where the leaks are on a map would go a long way to fixing them and preventing them in the future technology should be used to map complex underground piped networks and monitor collection points however without addressing the governance and enabling environment challenges no amount of new technologies will be able fix all the problems that systems face a good example of technology that support water systems is mwater a free data management platform used by over 40 000 people in 158 countries to map and monitor water and sanitation sites conduct surveys and collaborate with local governments 83 since being launched mwater has been used by 40 000 different researchers from ngos and governments 84 another example is the innovation hub that usaid has developed in india focused on water and sanitation issues so far it has been focused on supporting innovations related to service delivery and technological developments the hope has been that by encouraging these innovations there will be a greater number of homegrown solutions to water and sanitation problems in india 85 usaid should build on the success of its past wash interventions and continue to focus efforts on collecting data surrounding water and sanitation systems and protect the supply and availability of safe drinking water special attention should be paid to urban water systems moving forward as more and more people leave rural communities for cities lack of reliable performance information often leads to policy decisions which are not based on any sort of hard data and lead to problems with the financial viability of utilities if data collection and management were improved at the local levels some of these issues might be resolved 86 3 invest in domestic resource mobilization and develop municipal bond markets to help finance urban water solutions usaid administrator mark green has recognized the potential of domestic resource mobilization drm reforms and has made it a central theme of usaid s new journey to self reliance framework 87 a part of usaid s wash fin project is focused on supporting drm by helping service providers leverage domestic resources and build local capacity to track investment 88 rwanda s tax intake as a percentage of gdp has increased by roughly 6 percent over the past 17 years 89 improving drm efforts and prioritizing water and sanitation will help local and national governments finance their own drinking water and sanitation services when drm systems are strengthened local governments will be able to finance more water and sanitation systems an example of this is the usaid indonesia urban water sanitation and hygiene iuwash project from 2011 2016 and the iuwash plus project from 2016 2021 both implemented by dai iuwash brought reliable water supply to more than 3 million people and safely managed sanitation services to more than 230 000 city dwellers 90 through the iuwash project usaid and dai partnered with indonesian government agencies central provincial and local local government owned water utilities pdams ngos communities universities and the private sector 91 if governments in low and middle income countries can increase drm then governments can begin financing a larger portion of the wash programs in their urban communities and rely less on the international community providing utilities and quality infrastructure for urban populations will remain a challenge for developing country governments as people migrate from rural contexts to cities local authorities are under increased pressure to provide sustainable and reliable public services to their constituents such as water transportation sustainable energy and housing 92 the development of local currency bond markets especially municipal bonds can help local governments address numerous challenges to urban economic growth yet this will not be an easy endeavor developing bond markets will require tackling weak wash institutions and regulations substandard account keeping practices and poor fiscal practices usaid supported the first municipal bond in india in 1994 and capital market laws and regulations likely require reforms recent reforms include allowing foreign portfolio investment and municipal bonds were recently removed from following corporate bond requirements 93 94 through the fire d project in india usaid was able to provide a loan guarantee system that supported the local municipal bond market 95 the project lasted from 1994 to 2011 and focused more broadly on mobilizing resources and increasing cities abilities to finance water and sanitation systems in 16 states in india 96 4 ensure the sustainable use of water at the supply and at the collection point as part of the journey to self reliance framework all development organizations should be working themselves out of a job and toward a point where communities in low and middle income countries no longer need to rely on the international community for assistance this applies to the wash sector as well in order for governments in sub saharan africa or southeast asia to house feed and provide services for their urban populations it is critical that they have sustainable access to clean water and sanitation systems the support from the international community toward achieving sdg 6 is having a tremendous impact in communities around the world but concerns remain with the long term sustainability of these newly constructed infrastructure projects donor agencies and ngos should not only fund the initial construction of new wash systems but also help communities receive the training necessary to maintain the systems over time development programs may introduce new ways of collecting groundwater but fail to help communities develop maintenance plans to deal with malfunctions new technologies like pumps and filtration devices will not have the intended impact if locals cannot maintain the devices or use them properly the international institute for environment and development iied reported that up to 360 million had been spent on constructing boreholes and wells in africa that then became useless because they were not maintained or fixed when they broke down as a result 50 000 water supply points were not functioning across sub saharan africa in 2009 97 in order to have sustainable financing some communities should consider charging a small fee for access to water collection points this money could be used to support drinking water systems even after ngos and development agencies leave communities teaching communities the importance of protecting groundwater and preventing leaks and saltwater intrusion are important ways of improving the sustainability of wash systems as well according to the chicago council on global affairs groundwater has the highest rate of extraction of any raw material on the planet and rates of withdrawal are increasing at nearly twice the rate of population growth 98 strong country ownership and governance reforms are needed in order to achieve sdg 6 conclusion new sources of financing are needed in order to provide clean water and sanitation for citizens around the world the challenge is particularly acute in cities where population growth and urbanization are stretching resources and deteriorating living conditions the united states and its development agencies must further leverage private sector capital for wash programs and increase the efficiency of existing wash systems unless significant progress is made water and sanitation will be the greatest global challenge of the next decade daniel f runde is senior vice president director of the project on prosperity and development and holds the william a schreyer chair

advertisement president trump renews tariff threat on brazil and argentina share copy link copy president donald trump announced monday that the u s will restore steel and aluminum tariffs on brazil and argentina citing a massive devaluation of their currencies brazil and argentina have been presiding over a massive devaluation of their currencies which is not good for our farmers therefore effective immediately i will restore the tariffs on all steel aluminum that is shipped into the u s from those countries trump tweeted early monday morning from washington he also called on the federal reserve to act so that countries of which there are many no longer take advantage of our strong dollar by further devaluing their currencies formal notices of the tariffs were not immediately announced by the treasury or commerce departments or the office of the u s trade representative both brazil and argentina were exempted from 25 steel and 10 aluminum tariffs last year when trump was attempting to avoid a trade war with those countries brazilian president jair bolsonaro said monday that he has an open channel of communication with trump according to state news agency agencia brasil bolsonaro said he would meet with brazilian finance minister paulo guedes monday to discuss the issue and make a call to trump if needed argentina s production and labor minister called trump s decision to impose the tariffs unexpected there was no sign given to our government to the brazilian government or to the public sector that there would be a change in the deal with the united states dante sica told state run news agency telam on monday sica said he met with foreign minister jorge faurie after seeing the tweet in order to analyze the course of action and told telam that he had contacted the u s embassy in argentina as well all contacts in washington d c to get more clarity on the situation the president s decision amounts to retaliation against two countries that have served as alternative suppliers of soybeans and other farm products to china grabbing market share away from american farmers a key constituency the president will need to win reelection in 2020 but bolsonaro contended during a radio interview on monday that he doesn t view the tariffs as retaliation their economy does not compare to ours it is 10 times bigger than ours i don t see this as retaliation i m going to speak to him to see if trump doesn t over penalize us bolsonaro said i m certain he will be open to the conversation trump has prided himself on imposing tariffs and hammering trade deals to bolster his america first economic agenda but the biggest deal at the center of the trade war a u s china trade agreement has yet to be signed additional tariffs on chinese imports are expected to go into effect on dec 15 as china now the world s top steel producer has ramped up its steel production u s steel jobs have declined the president has promised to reinvigorate u s steel jobs but last year the steel industry added 2 400 jobs an increase of just over 1 employment in the industry is still down about 43 since 1990 the united states has bought more steel from brazil than any other country besides canada during the first nine months of this year making up nearly 11 of all steel imports according to census bureau data it relies on argentina much less for steel which made up less than 1 of imports brazil and argentina have also benefited from trump s trade war with china which has hurt american farmers in other ways brazil is the second biggest soybean producer in the world and it s where china s farmers have been getting a lot of their soybeans since beijing imposed retaliatory tariffs on u s agriculture argentina recently made a deal with china that will allow it to import soymeal starting next year in recent weeks however brazil and argentina have seen the values of their currencies drop the brazilian real is down more than 8 against the dollar this year and the argentine peso is down 37 as the country wrestles with an economic crisis that is more than other major emerging market currency including the south african rand mexican peso and south korean won the turkish lira is also down 8 this year in its latest report in may the treasury department had noted the u s dollar had appreciated against some emerging market currencies including the brazilian real amid intensifying economic crises in argentina and turkey but refrained from flagging it as a currency to watch during bolsonaro s visit to the white house earlier this year trump announced that the u s would be designating brazil as a non nato ally and recently a joint communique from the u s brazil ceo forum in late november described joint recommendations for enhancing the u s brazil economic relationship the statement on the forum which was attended by u s commerce secretary wilbur ross and u s director of the national economic council larry kudlow did not hint at any changes to the state of brazil s steel tariff exemption monday s announcement is not the first time that trump has accused a major trading partner of manipulating its currency in order to win a competitive advantage against the united states in june he attacked the european central bank for what he said was unfair manipulation of the euro and has sharply pointed in the past to japan and china as examples of countries that use monetary policy to pursue devaluation in order to gain a trading advantage over the u s in august amid tit for tat retaliation between the world s two largest economies trump directed treasury secretary steven mnuchin to label china a currency manipulator ratcheting up fears by investors that a currency war might ensue

advertisement president trump renews tariff threat on brazil and argentina share copy link copy president donald trump announced monday that the u s will restore steel and aluminum tariffs on brazil and argentina citing a massive devaluation of their currencies brazil and argentina have been presiding over a massive devaluation of their currencies which is not good for our farmers therefore effective immediately i will restore the tariffs on all steel aluminum that is shipped into the u s from those countries trump tweeted early monday morning from washington he also called on the federal reserve to act so that countries of which there are many no longer take advantage of our strong dollar by further devaluing their currencies formal notices of the tariffs were not immediately announced by the treasury or commerce departments or the office of the u s trade representative both brazil and argentina were exempted from 25 steel and 10 aluminum tariffs last year when trump was attempting to avoid a trade war with those countries brazilian president jair bolsonaro said monday that he has an open channel of communication with trump according to state news agency agencia brasil bolsonaro said he would meet with brazilian finance minister paulo guedes monday to discuss the issue and make a call to trump if needed argentina s production and labor minister called trump s decision to impose the tariffs unexpected there was no sign given to our government to the brazilian government or to the public sector that there would be a change in the deal with the united states dante sica told state run news agency telam on monday sica said he met with foreign minister jorge faurie after seeing the tweet in order to analyze the course of action and told telam that he had contacted the u s embassy in argentina as well all contacts in washington d c to get more clarity on the situation the president s decision amounts to retaliation against two countries that have served as alternative suppliers of soybeans and other farm products to china grabbing market share away from american farmers a key constituency the president will need to win reelection in 2020 but bolsonaro contended during a radio interview on monday that he doesn t view the tariffs as retaliation their economy does not compare to ours it is 10 times bigger than ours i don t see this as retaliation i m going to speak to him to see if trump doesn t over penalize us bolsonaro said i m certain he will be open to the conversation trump has prided himself on imposing tariffs and hammering trade deals to bolster his america first economic agenda but the biggest deal at the center of the trade war a u s china trade agreement has yet to be signed additional tariffs on chinese imports are expected to go into effect on dec 15 as china now the world s top steel producer has ramped up its steel production u s steel jobs have declined the president has promised to reinvigorate u s steel jobs but last year the steel industry added 2 400 jobs an increase of just over 1 employment in the industry is still down about 43 since 1990 the united states has bought more steel from brazil than any other country besides canada during the first nine months of this year making up nearly 11 of all steel imports according to census bureau data it relies on argentina much less for steel which made up less than 1 of imports brazil and argentina have also benefited from trump s trade war with china which has hurt american farmers in other ways brazil is the second biggest soybean producer in the world and it s where china s farmers have been getting a lot of their soybeans since beijing imposed retaliatory tariffs on u s agriculture argentina recently made a deal with china that will allow it to import soymeal starting next year in recent weeks however brazil and argentina have seen the values of their currencies drop the brazilian real is down more than 8 against the dollar this year and the argentine peso is down 37 as the country wrestles with an economic crisis that is more than other major emerging market currency including the south african rand mexican peso and south korean won the turkish lira is also down 8 this year in its latest report in may the treasury department had noted the u s dollar had appreciated against some emerging market currencies including the brazilian real amid intensifying economic crises in argentina and turkey but refrained from flagging it as a currency to watch during bolsonaro s visit to the white house earlier this year trump announced that the u s would be designating brazil as a non nato ally and recently a joint communique from the u s brazil ceo forum in late november described joint recommendations for enhancing the u s brazil economic relationship the statement on the forum which was attended by u s commerce secretary wilbur ross and u s director of the national economic council larry kudlow did not hint at any changes to the state of brazil s steel tariff exemption monday s announcement is not the first time that trump has accused a major trading partner of manipulating its currency in order to win a competitive advantage against the united states in june he attacked the european central bank for what he said was unfair manipulation of the euro and has sharply pointed in the past to japan and china as examples of countries that use monetary policy to pursue devaluation in order to gain a trading advantage over the u s in august amid tit for tat retaliation between the world s two largest economies trump directed treasury secretary steven mnuchin to label china a currency manipulator ratcheting up fears by investors that a currency war might ensue
washington president donald trump said today that he would impose tariffs on steel and aluminum from brazil and argentina a move that would shatter previous agreements with those countries and widen a global trade war that the president had appeared ready to scale back trump in a message on twitter accused brazil and argentina of manipulating their currencies and hurting american farmers therefore effective immediately i will restore the tariffs on all steel aluminum that is shipped into the u s from those countries the trump administration cannot restore tariffs because it never imposed them on brazilian and argentine metals though it did force them to limit shipments to the united states under a quota system last year the united states exempted brazil argentina and other countries from the president s sweeping metal tariffs in march 2018 with the united states saying it would continue negotiations with those countries to improve their trade terms in may 2018 the united states announced that it had reached an agreement with the countries that would cap their metal shipments at a specific volume each year but the president s move suggested that neither previous agreements nor political alliances could protect a country from sudden trade confrontations with the united states economic struggles such as those confronting brazil and argentina also appeared to be no defense trump s announcement was particularly jarring to brazil s conservative populist president jair bolsonaro who had gone to great lengths to strengthen ties with the trump administration with little to show for it aluminum bolsonaro asked when reporters presented him with trump s tweet if that s the case i ll call trump i have an open channel with him dante sica argentina s minister of production called the move completely unexpected i was in washington last week and i talked to a lot of people and there was no sign whatsoever that there would be any kind of change he said it is unclear what prompted trump to reverse previous agreements but last week the brazilian currency the real fell to a record low against the dollar after the country s economic minister signaled that he was not concerned about exchange rate fluctuations argentina s peso has weakened with the country in the midst of an economic crisis both economists and government officials have rejected the idea that brazil and argentina are manipulating their currencies but those currency movements have made brazilian and argentine goods cheaper to purchase abroad a dynamic that is particularly important for the agricultural sector and the u s china trade war china is a major purchaser of u s pork soybeans and other agricultural goods as the united states and china have slapped tariffs on each others products in a yearlong trade war china has shifted to purchasing products from brazil and argentina instead a move that has rankled trump and other u s officials i gave them a big break on tariffs but now i m taking that break off because it s very unfair to our manufacturers and very unfair to our farmers trump told reporters monday our steel companies will be very happy and our farmers will be very happy as of this morning neither the office of the u s trade representative nor the commerce department had issued the formal notices that would put tariffs on brazil and argentina into effect if they are imposed the tariffs stand to do considerable damage to south america s two biggest economies at a time when argentina is in recession and brazil confronts high unemployment and anemic growth stocks on monday fell after economic reports suggested that the u s economy continues to face significant headwinds the latest gauge of manufacturing activity from the institute for supply management a trade group showed activity in the sector contracted for the fourth consecutive month in november the s p 500 was down nearly 1 shortly after 11 a m putting the benchmark index on track for its worst day since oct 8 the trade sensitive tech sector was the worst performing part of the index falling about 1 7 sica scoffed at the claim that brazil and argentina have been deliberately devaluing their currencies our currency has a flexible exchange rate and adapts itself to global changes he said brad setser a senior fellow for international economics at the council on foreign relations said neither brazil nor argentina are manipulating their currency he added that argentina is in a full blown economic crisis and is close to running out of foreign exchange reserves after selling foreign currency to try to support the value of the peso over the last year the announcement monday was the latest escalation in trump s global trade war trump has also threatened new tariffs on products from china mexico the european union vietnam and elsewhere with next year s election approaching the trump administration appeared to be working toward a resolution on several of these fronts it reached an agreement to lift metal tariffs on canada and mexico and declined to impose devastating car tariffs on the european union it has been trying to seal a first phase trade deal with china though the two sides are continuing to grapple over terms and the administration has been pushing for congress to approve its revision of the north american free trade agreement which would check off a major campaign promise for trump but the tariffs on brazil and argentina suggest that trump has not abandoned his confrontational approach today he said on twitter that u s stock markets are up as much as 21 since he announced the metal tariffs on march 1 2018 and that the united states was taking in massive amounts of money in tariff revenue any new tariffs would likely face legal challenges however the president imposed the tariffs to stop a flood of imported steel and aluminum that his administration has claimed threatens american producers and thus u s national security the idea has been disputed with several countries bringing cases against the united states at the world trade organization and in a recent decision the u s court of international trade a federal court ruled that trump could not raise tariffs on steel exports from turkey because a 180 day deadline set for that decision had already elapsed jennifer hillman a senior fellow for trade and international political economy at the council on foreign relations said the law that the president had used to issue the tariffs section 232 of the trade expansion act of 1962 did not give him the authority to alter tariffs outside of certain time limits trump cannot legally convert the current quotas to tariffs she said changing a quota to tariff more than a year and a half after the original action is outside those limits supporters of trump s tariffs say they have provided some protection against cheaper metals imported from abroad but other economic factors have continued to weigh on the industry in the meantime including china s large scale production and a weakening manufacturing sector in the united states and abroad the tariffs have also angered american manufacturers of automobiles machinery food packaging and other products who must pay more for the metal they purchase the brazil steel institute which represents the interest of steel exporters said in a statement that it found the new tariffs perplexing and warned that it would harm companies in both countries the decision will end up harming the american steel producing companies which need the semifinished products exported by brazil to operate its plants the institute said

president donald and first lady melania trump walk to board air force one for a trip to london to attend the nato summit monday dec 2 2019 at andrews air force base md ap photo evan vucci washington president donald trump revved up his global trade war on two fronts monday announcing tariffs on industrial metals from brazil and argentina while eyeing tariffs of up to 100 percent on dozens of popular french products the administration said the moves were necessary because u s trading partners were acting unfairly to disadvantage both the country s traditional economic pillars as well as its best hopes for future prosperity in a pre dawn tweet trump said he was ordering new tariffs on steel and aluminum from brazil and argentina to counter what he called a massive devaluation of their currencies at the expense of american farmers the unexpected announcement upends the latin american countries 2018 agreement with trump to accept quotas on their shipments to the u s in place of the import taxes hours later robert lighthizer the president s chief trade negotiator released the results of a five month investigation that concluded a french digital services tax discriminated against american internet companies and should be met with tariffs of up to 100 percent on 2 4 billion in products such as cheese yogurt sparkling wine and makeup the proposal which awaits a presidential decision threatens to intensify simmering trans atlantic trade friction coming with trump already accusing european car makers of enjoying government protection from american competition the french tax discriminates against u s companies is inconsistent with prevailing principles of international tax policy and is unusually burdensome for affected u s companies lighthizer said in a statement monday s protectionist flurry came as the president s america first trade policy remains bogged down at the negotiating table and on capitol hill less than a year before the 2020 election even as the president flew to london for a north atlantic treaty organization summit all the essentials of trumpian policymaking bold action debatable economics and sparse details were on display back in washington advertisement fallout from the president s renewed embrace of tariffs could cloud prospects for future or ongoing talks with countries in asia and europe it ought to make a whole lot of people nervous said william reinsch of the center for strategic and international studies it kinda makes people wonder what s the point of negotiating if this is going to happen the administration s action against france is designed to create leverage for just such a negotiation at issue is a 3 percent tax france introduced last year which the administration says would unfairly target the american stars of the digital economy french lawmakers call the levy les gafa an acronym for google amazon facebook and apple companies that french officials accuse of paying insufficient taxes on revenues earned in france amazon founder jeff bezos owns the washington post administration officials worry the french tax could set a precedent for other countries lighthizer said he may open investigations into similar taxes in austria italy and turkey industry groups welcomed the recommendation with some such as the information industry technology council calling for both countries to work out a lasting tax policy resolution at the organization for economic co operation and development today ustr is defending the internet which is a great american export said a statement from the internet association an industry group apart from the specifics of monday s order trump s tweets amounted to a robust defense of his unconstrained use of import taxes u s markets are up as much as 21 since the announcement of tariffs on 3 1 2018 trump wrote in an apparent reference to the technology heavy nasdaq index and the u s is taking in massive amounts of money and giving some to our farmers who have been targeted by china the president s enthusiasm for tariffs is not shared by federal reserve chairman jerome powell who has said they are making executives so uncertain about the outlook that companies are delaying investments and slowing the economy likewise the 28 billion in tariff revenue that trump has earmarked for farmers hurt by his trade war is effectively a tax paid by other americans and now amounts to more than twice the 2009 bailout of the u s auto industry trump s action against brazil and argentina took officials in both countries by surprise typically the u s provides businesses with some warning of tariff changes delaying their effective date to allow goods in transit to arrive at american ports without being taxed but the president tweeted that his tariff order was effective immediately in a sign of how abruptly trump had acted his own administration was unprepared to provide details the white house referred questions about the new policy to the commerce department which referred a reporter back to the white house officials at the customs and border protection agency which collects tariffs from importers referred a reporter to lighthizer s office which did not respond to a request for comment commerce secretary wilbur ross told fox business even our friends must live by the rules our best allies must live by the rules what the president was concerned about was deterioration of the brazilian currency that is a fair factor to take into account it s a real factor the lower their currency the cheaper products coming in he felt he had to do something about it they are not the only one where there are currency issues for the moment i don t know that china is such a bad problem with currency but they have been in the past it s not clear what rules the president believes brazil or argentina has violated brazil s economy over the past year has barely grown advancing at an annual rate of just 0 2 percent the brazilian central bank has cut interest rates three times since august in a bid to jump start growth as a consequence the brazilian currency the real has fallen about 8 percent this year against the dollar argentina meanwhile is mired in a financial crisis that has left its economy smaller today than it was four years ago and resulted in a humiliating rescue from the international monetary fund as investors fled the currency this year lost 37 percent of its value the argentine central bank has hiked its main interest rate to 63 percent in a bid to halt the decline advertisement everybody is moving their money out of argentina said desmond lachman an economist at the american enterprise institute and a former imf official i m not sure what he wants the government to do there is no evidence that either country s currency moves are designed to gain an unfair trade edge according to economists and financial market experts these things are signs of a very sick patient not signs of a robust economy said marc chandler chief market strategist for bannockburn global forex the whole region is on fire brazil s 4 9 billion in exports to the u s over the past two months were almost 2 percent lower than during the same period in 2018 the president also renewed his assault on the federal reserve on monday tweeting that it should likewise act so that countries of which there are many no longer take advantage of our strong dollar by further devaluing their currencies falling currencies abroad act like a price increase on american exports this makes it very hard for our manufactures farmers to fairly export their goods lower rates loosen fed the president tweeted for months the fed has been the target of the president s ire for raising interest rates as the economy strengthened but fed chairman jerome powell reversed course at the end of july citing the effects of the president s trade war on business confidence and investment negotiations with china over a partial trade deal are only crawling forward almost two months after trump called reporters to the oval office to announce he had reached an agreement in principle with beijing likewise a new north american trade deal awaits congressional approval months after the administration hoped it would be finished advertisement the washington post s david nakamura and jeanne whalen in washington and heloisa traiano in rio de janeiro contributed to this report

the discipline of economics is going through some well deserved turmoil from queen elizabeth s plaintive why did nobody notice it query to british economists regarding the 2008 financial crisis to the long overdue recognition of gender and racial imbalances within our ranks to the admission that we don t know within a policy relevant interval many of the economy s key parameters economists have realized we have a great deal of work to do there s been a spate of recent books and articles trying to understand where economics went wrong and to offer a new path forward in the sense of structuring the economy in ways that have greater potential to improve overall social well being as i ve been paging through these analyses i ve been struck by what i think and hope is the promise of a fundamental change in the practice of economics simply put it is possible though far from inevitable that a new economics one i ll call can do economics could evolve in opposition to can t do economics advertisement when a few decades ago i began my career as a washington political economist it quickly became clear that a big part of the job of mainstream economists was to explain to well meaning progressive policymakers why they couldn t do the things they wanted to do initiatives such as raising minimum wages pursuing very low unemployment strategic government investments in certain industries running federal budget deficits regulating financial markets or reducing post tax inequality through progressive taxation would all backfire wage mandates undermine market equilibriums leading to massive unemployment too low unemployment triggers spiraling inflation if the government tries to pick sectoral winners it will distort the market s allocative efficiency public sector budget deficits will crowd out private borrowing and push up interest rates regulating finance will thwart its innovations taxing the wealthy will kill their motivation thereby hurting investment growth and jobs all of this has turned out to be wrong and now we have the potential to move from can t do to can do economics minimum wage increases budget deficits low unemployment industrial policy and so on not only can have their intended effects they are necessary to offset structural economic inequalities that s not to say we can set wage floors with no regard to potential job losses or that historically large budget deficits and low unemployment will never pressure interest rates or inflation but the evidence shows that we can t assume the old negative outcomes and thus must constantly test the waters advertisement in contrast with the old school can do economics firmly rejects the assumption that the private economy will automatically settle into optimal conditions that policy actions can only distort the central economic assumption must flip from equilibrium to disequilibrium for example we cannot assume the market will deliver full employment in fact while can t do economics was obsessed with preventing inflation can do economics is obsessed with getting to and staying at full employment it begins from the recognition that power imbalances and excesses of unregulated capital will leave out large groups of people often based on racial differences inflate credit bubbles and pollute the environment in can do economics market failures are not the exception they re the rule this is all 40 000 feet up so let s get granular can t do economics argued that unemployment below 6 percent then 5 percent then 4 percent would lead to spiraling inflation advertisement can do economics recognizes that we cannot reliably identify the lowest unemployment rate consistent with stable inflation so we should allow the jobless rate to fall as low as it can and carefully monitor price and wage inflation share this article share can t do economics argued that public budget deficits crowd out private borrowing and lead to worse investment outcomes can do economics recognizes that low interest rates relative to growth rates and global capital flows seeking safe u s government bonds significantly lower the economic costs of budget deficits thus the government can often safely borrow to make productive investments can t do economics argued that inequality was a function of meritocratic outcomes and to offset such outcomes through the tax code would dampen the incentives of the successful advertisement can do economics recognizes that racial discrimination past and present housing segregation unequal access to the pathways of upward mobility the fall in unionization and labor protections and the rise of concentrated employer power means that market outcomes themselves are a function not of meritocracy but of power imbalances can t do economics argues that free trade is always worth pursuing can do economics recognizes that there is no such thing as free trade see for example patent protectionism that big pharma lobbyists got into the new nafta trade is managed by rules set up by trading partners and these rules have winners and losers now for the caveats of which there are many whenever paradigms shift there s a danger of going too far in the opposite direction as i noted the relationships between unemployment and inflation or deficits and interest rates aren t dead and must be monitored trade deals may be often corrupt but trade flows can be highly beneficial not just to us but to developing countries that need capital to grow in other words avoiding protectionism is a value of both the old and the new economics while lower fiscal costs support deficit financed productive public investments that doesn t mean dysfunction governments will spend wisely advertisement there s also a risk that i m leaning too far over my skis i ve long argued that what keeps the old economics alive despite its constant empirical failures is the deep pocketed power structure that supports it that s why we keep getting trickle down tax cuts that fail to pay for themselves or boost investment as advertised but simply exacerbate inequality that power structure remains solidly in place and it will use its entrenched power its media access bought and paid for politicians and a think tank network to continue to elevate can t do economics but there is a new cohort of can do economists to meet some of us see these links and policymakers regarding the latter i know they re out there because every week i get an email from one of them asking in so many words why can t we do x where x is an idea prohibited by can t do economics i won t name names because these are private communications
with politically unpopular reforms consigned to the too hard basket immigration likely will continue propping up economic growth until it too reaches its limits time bomb or otherwise australia s demographic clock is definitely ticking population growth driven by immigration has helped power australia to a record breaking 28 straight years of economic expansion yet government warnings of an aging time bomb have sparked alarm that the good times cannot last forever even in the lucky country australian treasurer josh frydenberg raised the alarm in mid november when he suggested the nation s increasing aged population could represent an economic time bomb it is a great development that people are living longer but we must be prepared for the implications if we don t remain fiscally disciplined today the next generation will have to pick up the bill tomorrow he told the committee for economic development of australia in sydney the treasurer warned of a growing fiscal burden on both the revenue and spending side particularly amid stagnating productivity growth among its estimated 25 million population baby boomers those born between 1946 and 1964 now number more than 5 million with their retirements constituting a structural headwind for the economy the baby boomers are forecast to cost the government budget some a 36 billion us 24 billion a year by 2028 more than it spends on the national health insurance scheme medicare at around 15 percent australia s elderly defined as those aged 65 and older as a proportion of the overall population is well below other oecd nations such as japan 25 percent and germany 21 percent according to the oecd s 2014 data yet key demographic indicators such as the dependency ratio are deteriorating from nearly eight working age persons for every australian aged over 65 in the 1970s the proportion has now halved and could drop to as low as two by 2066 depending on immigration levels the proportion of australians aged over 85 could triple in size to reach around 1 5 million over the same period accounting for 4 percent of the total population meanwhile the number of those not paying income tax could reach 22 percent of the population up from 15 percent currently the older the population is the more people are on welfare benefits we need more health care and there s a smaller base to pay the taxes professor ian harper of the melbourne business school told the abc s 7 30 program an older population is also seen lowering consumption and increasing savings contributing to deflationary pressures as seen in advanced aging societies such as japan government debt is also likely to rise due to governments reluctance to cut pensions and raise taxes for political reasons the reserve bank of australia has slashed official interest rates to a record low of 0 75 percent amid low inflation and sluggish economic growth curbing savings income for retirees and forcing many to work longer while the current retirement age is 66 it is scheduled to reach 67 by july 2023 although plans to raise it to 70 were axed in the face of public opposition declining birth rate australia s demographics since the 1970s have been a tale of declining births offset by increased new arrivals since 1976 australia s total fertility rate tfr has been below the estimated replacement level of 2 1 babies per women in 2017 the tfr was 1 74 well down on its postwar levels above 3 percent abs data reveals the prospect for a turnaround appears limited given the downward slide in developed world birth rates and domestic factors young australians are facing a hell of a hill they are coming out of universities with a much larger debt than their parents did and they are going to have to buy in the most expensive housing market in the world all against a backdrop of negative income growth economist gerard minack said it s a trifecta that s pretty tough for them making up the difference has been high levels of immigration according to abs data nearly two thirds of population growth in the year to march 2019 was from net overseas migration particularly in the populous eastern states of new south wales victoria and queensland high immigration levels have become increasingly important to the economy adding an estimated 0 5 and 1 percentage point annually to gdp growth migrants are typically also younger than the resident population with around 84 percent of those arriving in fiscal 2016 less than 40 years old compared to 54 percent of the resident population more than a quarter of the nation s population was born overseas led by former british residents who accounted for 5 percent of the population in 2016 however those born in asia now outnumber those born in europe with people born in china now accounting for 2 5 percent india 2 2 percent and the philippines 1 1 percent the tendency of such new arrivals to settle in the major cities of sydney and melbourne has sparked concerns of increasing pressure on infrastructure and housing costs together with rising pollution and quality of life issues congestion in australia s state capitals is estimated to cost the economy a 25 billion a year in lost productivity with driving still the dominant form of travel yet any move by canberra to turn off the immigration tap could tip the economy into recession population increase is estimated to have contributed around 1 66 percent to annual gdp growth in the decade since the global financial crisis gfc compared to 1 24 percent in the prior period the latest gdp data showed the economy slowing to a 1 4 percent annual expansion its weakest pace since the gfc amid sluggish household spending and weak business investment in a per capita sense the economy went backwards in the last 12 months westpac economist bill evans told abc news reform push could reforms help alleviate australia s demographic pressures accounting group pwc suggests increasing workforce participation rates among younger workers females and elderly could lift potential gdp by as much as 12 percent it argues that australia ranks only 14th of 35 countries in labor market performance below the oecd average realizing the potential economic gains from greater participation will need a mix of policies to overcome discrimination in the workplace boost vocational training including retraining for all age groups and improve childcare and flexible working arrangements said pwc chief economist jeremy thorpe successive australian governments have certainly made progress over the last two decades but our analysis suggests more needs to be done for australia to match international best practice and drive economic growth amid a backlash over any move to raise the pension age the australian government has proposed measures including encouraging migrants to settle in regional areas and developing alternative employment hubs in major cities as well as providing funding to alleviate urban congestion and strengthen infrastructure growth in the working age population is still seen giving australia an advantage through to 2025 along with other immigration friendly countries such as the united states canada and britain according to nikko asset management s chris rands yet as australia s frydenberg admitted productivity is the most important source of income growth over the long run contributing three quarters of real gross national income growth over the past 30 years with politically unpopular reforms consigned to the too hard basket immigration likely will continue propping up economic growth until it too reaches its limits time bomb or otherwise australia s demographic clock is definitely ticking
is crypto in africa popular increasingly so and you could argue that parts of the continent are world leading back in april google trends data revealed that lagos in nigeria has the world s highest volume of online searches for bitcoin btc a lot of this is driven by frustration toward existing payment solutions with the likes of paypal actually barring nigerians from receiving international money transfers because of the country s reputation for fraud millions of innocent consumers are suffering as a result because they have no choice but to use alternatives which charge high fees some tout cryptocurrencies as a perfect solution which enable enterprising africans to receive payments as they form business connections around the world surveys have also revealed that africa a hub for m commerce is a hotspot when it comes to owning crypto about 5 5 of adult internet users worldwide own some form of digital currency but three african nations lie above this average according to hootsuite s 2019 global digital yearbook 10 7 of south africans possess crypto the highest of any country surveyed nigeria also makes the list at 7 8 with ghana at 7 3 why is africa so keen on cryptocurrencies the reasons behind its popularity are multi faceted and fascinating cross border payments are a contributing factor especially given how remittances are often sent from countries like south africa to 15 other countries on the continent in what is known as the southern african development community unpredictability in local fiat currencies is another issue this year the south african rand returned to form as the world s most volatile currency prompting consumers to seek protection for their money africans living in other countries on the continent have also been losing faith in their central banks just look at zimbabwe where levels of hyperinflation have been rife bitcoin has become so popular there that demand is dramatically outstripping supply meaning btc sometimes trades at a sizeable premium to prices in the rest of the world back in june the country reinstated the zimbabwean dollar after a 13 year absence and simultaneously banned united states dollars british pounds and other foreign currencies wary of shortages and instability that have blighted the economy in the past zimbabwe has become one of the continent s biggest crypto markets because some consumers believe the likes of bitcoin and ether eth are more trustworthy what could crypto as well as blockchain solve advocates say there are many issues beyond currency volatility where crypto and blockchain could make a difference aside from remittances and currency volatility financial inclusion is another hot button topic in africa research from the world bank suggests that many of the world s 1 7 billion unbanked are on the continent while 2 in 3 adults in sub saharan africa do not have access to a bank account in some ways africa is better prepared for a move to crypto than other continents mobile money has already been a key driver in reducing the numbers of unbanked adults and the world bank says the continent is home to all eight countries where more than 1 in 5 adults solely rely on a mobile only account given how many consumers are already open to using this technology crypto exchanges and wallets that offer fully functional apps for mobile users are set to benefit immensely blockchain is also showing plenty of promise as a recent cointelegraph article explained stakeholders in the region say distributed ledger technology will be instrumental in solving long standing developmental issues and unlocking much needed economic growth nigerian politicians believe that blockchain will drive the world s fourth industrial revolution and for the first time africa has the opportunity to have a seat at the table fintech companies across the continent are growing substantially hotspots include cape town where the number of startups being established has risen 23 and nairobi where there has been a 28 rise there is also hope that blockchain technology can help bring around dramatic improvement to the infrastructure in africa in nigeria companies are working together to see whether blockchain can be implemented in a push to make the nation s roads safer the west african nation of sierra leone has been working on the development of a blockchain based id system for its citizens amid hopes it could enable financial institutions to verify identities and build credit histories in a way that wasn t possible before uganda has also teamed up with a blockchain startup to clamp down on the supply of counterfeit drugs nationwide with reports suggesting that up to 10 of prescriptions result in fake medicine how are things looking in terms of regulation many african countries aren t happy about crypto s arrival a handful of african countries have banned crypto altogether including morocco algeria libya zambia and namibia others have created substantial amounts of uncertainty by failing to offer a clear stance leaving consumers in a gray area south africa has been somewhat of a bright spot on the continent where regulators have expressed enthusiasm about crypto s potential official bodies have actually been working in concert with crypto companies and financial institutions to find the best way forward this year work has been underway to develop an intergovernmental cryptocurrency regulatory framework but the report is yet to be released many crypto advocates continue to be buoyed by an upbeat position paper released by the south african reserve bank all the way back in 2014 in which it said increasing merchant acceptance integrating existing conventional payment instruments with decentralized convertible virtual currency and promoting the advantages inherent in such systems thus there is potential for real growth of bitcoin in its current operational environment
washington president donald trump announced plans monday dec 2 to resurrect tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports from brazil and argentina stunning political and industry leaders in those countries and extending the white house s adversarial trade tactics to new fronts trump took aim at both nations on twitter claiming that the devaluation of their currencies was hurting american farmers though it was unclear what specifically triggered the announcement he then directed his attention to the federal reserve which he has frequently slammed for not cutting rates brazil and argentina have been presiding over a massive devaluation of their currencies which is not good for our farmers trump said in an early morning tweet he added that the u s s central bank should act so that countries of which there are many no longer take advantage of our strong dollar by further devaluing their currencies this makes it very hard for our farmers to fairly export their goods lower rates loosen fed reserve should likewise act so that countries of which there are many no longer take advantage of our strong dollar by further devaluing their currencies this makes it very hard for our manufactures farmers to fairly export their goods lower rates loosen fed donald j trump realdonaldtrump december 2 2019 advertisement the surprise announcement came after it appeared as though the white house was preparing to dial back its aggressive trade approach in the lead up to next year s election the administration appeared close to a deal with house democrats to revamp the north american free trade agreement and tensions with china had eased in recent weeks trump s tweets were not accompanied by any announcement from the commerce department or the u s trade representative announcing the change more formally the tariffs took aim at one of the most vital industries in brazil at a particularly vulnerable moment unemployment is above 10 percent and the economy has stalled the steel industry long one of the nation s economic engines has been looking increasingly wobbly as well slashing growth projections earlier this year brazilian steel exports to the u s accounted for roughly 2 6 billion last year making the united states one of brazil s biggest markets for steel and analysts expected the tariffs to be painful in argentina where steel and aluminum exports represent roughly 700 million the unexpected news comes as the nation is undergoing a transition of power if the tariffs persist they will be one of the earliest diplomatic tests to face the incoming presidency of alberto fernández a leftist politician who will take office within a week before leaving the white house for a trip to a nato gathering in london trump told reporters he had given brazil and argentina a big break on tariffs but now i m taking that break off it s very unfair to our manufacturers and very unfair to our farmers trump said our steel companies will be very happy and our farmers will be very happy advertisement in brazil the tariffs announcement stunned officials who for nearly a year have sought to develop closer ties with the united states particularly brazilian president jair bolsonaro nicknamed by some as the trump of the tropics bolsonaro has repeatedly praised trump mimicked his rhetoric and even tried to install his son as the ambassador to the united states but on monday bolsonaro appeared taken by surprise i m going to speak with paulo guedes he told several reporters outside the presidential palace referring to the country s finance minister aluminum i m going to speak with paulo guedes now if necessary i ll call trump i have an open channel with him later in the day the brazilian foreign ministry issued a statement saying it acknowledged president trump s declaration over the possible imposition of tariffs and that the government was in touch with officials in washington the brazilian government will work to defend brazilian commercial interests and facilitate commerce with the united states with a view to widen the commercial exchange and deepen the bilateral relationship to the benefit of both countries the statement said the news was met by confusion in the brazilian steel sector the brazilian steel institute which represents most of the country s steel companies said it was perplexed not only by the tariffs but by trump s accusations that the government was trying to artificially devalue the brazilian currency related at least 19 killed as mexican cartel battles police and army south of u s border mexico s

ratchets up trade tensions david wessel director of the hutchins center on fiscal and monetary policy at the brookings institution said the markets have been hopeful that the trade war may soon end making the timing of trump s announcement all the more surprising rattling the trade war saber which may play well with his base seems to me like it is likely to hurt the markets wessel said by midmorning monday the major u s indexes were in negative territory the dow jones industrial average was off roughly 0 7 the standard poor s 500 was 0 7 in the red and the nasdaq composite was down roughly 1 percent trump also appeared to push for a two pronged approach to weakening the u s dollar through action by the fed and by dealing hits to foreign countries the president doesn t seem to see any contradiction between his frequent assertions that the u s is the strongest economy in the world and his insistence that in such circumstances the u s dollar should be going down wessel said some analysts in washington suggested that trump s punitive actions on brazil and argentina were rooted in the president s larger trade war with china which has become central to his reelection effort as he seeks to negotiate a trade deal with the world s second largest economic power in 2020 yet china has reacted to trump s higher tariffs on u s agricultural products by importing more soybeans from those two south american nations the analysts said and the president is now attempting to exert leverage on brasilia and buenos aires in a bid to limit their cooperation with beijing i don t think this has a whole lot to do with steel this is a china issue said fernando cutz a western hemisphere expert at the cohen group who served on the national security council under both president barack obama and trump if ustr wants to maximize a trade deal with china they need to put pressure on china but if china figures out how to replace the u s markets with brazil and argentina that s not creating pressure advertisement the treasury department twice each year issues a report that looks at the currency policies of all major economies to determine whether any nation is improperly manipulating its currency this is at least the second time that trump has made a declaration about another nation s policies that did not mesh with his own treasury department s formal assessment in august he declared that china had been manipulating its currency forcing treasury secretary steven mnuchin to scramble and assert the same even though treasury had not found china to be manipulating its currency in its official evaluation and in the latest report released in may treasury did not allege brazil or argentina had done anything improper in handling their currencies instead that report said that the u s dollar had strengthened against the currencies of brazil and india as external pressures on many emerging markets intensified in the midst of crises in argentina and turkey monday s directive marks the latest twist in trump s trade war which has become a major fixture of his foreign and economic policies trump has said he looked to clinch a trade deal with china this year but those talks have unraveled on multiple occasions trump is now focused on a partial trade deal which he has referred to as phase one and which would include large purchases of u s farm products by beijing the next potential deadline that could bring the united states and china to the table comes dec 15 when trump s next round of tariffs is scheduled to affect about 160 billion in chinese goods a deal could make those levies disappear according to sources familiar with the talks earlier in trump s presidency in march 2018 top steel suppliers including brazil south korea and japan complained that the office of the u s trade representative had yet to establish a process for countries to apply for tariff exemptions just days before tariffs on foreign made steel and aluminum were scheduled to take effect at the time brazil was the no 2 steel supplier to the united states in 2017 the u s imported 34 6 million metric tons of steel from 85 countries trump imposed the steel and aluminum tariffs after his commerce department found that the large amount of these imports posed a threat to the national security of the united states trump has tried to use these and other tariffs as leverage against other countries to change their trade policies with mixed success in june trump threatened to impose tariffs on mexican goods and even shut down the u s border if more wasn t done to crack down on migrant crossings this did prompt mexico to negotiate and make some changes a response white house officials felt validated the hardball tactics advertisement initially the steel and aluminum tariffs trump imposed seemed to lead to a brief revival of the domestic steel industry leading companies to expand hiring as prices increased but there are signs that this renaissance was short lived and some plants have begun cutting workers amid a slump in stock values and steel prices trump and bolsonaro have shared a particular bond that spans their shared antagonism of the news media to massive fires in the amazon rainforest recently trump pledged to take brazil s side as bolsonaro said the powerful group of seven countries were criticizing his government s response to the fires when french president emmanuel macron announced in august that g 7 member nations had approved a 22 million emergency aid package to help combat the fires the trump administration did not give its support saying that any solution should be done in consultation with brazil trump later praised bolsonaro for working very hard on the amazon fires and in all respects doing a great job for the people of brazil this article was written by rachel siegel david nakamura and terrence mccoy reporters for the washington post the washington post s david j lynch in washington and heloisa traiano in

if deflation is coming sell your gold from 2009 the debate over inflation versus deflation has been going on in hard money circles since about 1973 the debate has gone on within academic circles for well over a century the economists are as confused as the general public but they are confused in a far more sophisticated way they turn confusion into a science i follow the austrian school of economics on monetary theory the most important study of the theory of money within the austrian school camp was published in 1912 the theory of money and credit written by ludwig von mises you can download it for free here more popular and more readable books have been written on this by his disciple murray rothbard his book what has government done to our money is the clearest exposition ever written you can download it here i have also written a short book on the topic mises on money download it here finally there is my more detailed book honest money austrian school economists define inflation as follows an increase in the money supply all other schools of thought define inflation as follows an increase in our favorite price index austrian school economists define deflation as follows a decrease in the money supply all other schools of thought and define deflation as follows a decrease in our favorite price index price indexes you don t buy a price index you buy a specific product or service it does not matter what the price index says if you can t afford to buy much what is a price index it is a statistical construct that is created in terms of a theory of how an economy operates it is supposed to measure increases and decreases in prices it does this the question is which prices retail wholesale both how many prices are there far more than the number of retail products and services in a recent estimate of the number of products not services 60 of the u s economy in the new york city area one economist offered this number at least 10 billion eric beinhocker the origin of wealth p 9 this does not include discounts for which new york city is famous now add los angeles chicago dallas and atlanta get the picture begin here a price index is a statistical illusion some illusions are more accurate than others nobody knows which ones economists meaning a committee of economists try to come to some agreement about which products and which services in an economy are representative of the largest number of people living in this economy there is no real agreement here but they have to come up with something in addition to deciding which products and services are most representative they also have to come up with a system of assigning relevance or weights for example they have to decide which is more important for the supposedly typical resident food or fuel there is no agreement here either economists do their best to examine statistics of how much money was spent last year on which items then they come to an agreement of sorts regarding the products and services to be used in the index and how much importance to assign to each of them then the economists turn their theory over to statisticians statisticians hired by the government create sophisticated statistical analyses based on statistical sampling when they are done with this sampling at government expense and compelled by law for those questioned to answer they put together an index of prices for a particular time period the problem here should be obvious the public changes its taste over time a product or service that was widely used in one period of time falls in popularity similarly some other product possibly one that did not even exist 10 years ago becomes wildly popular think about the ipod this means that the statisticians must get together with the economists and hash out the issue all over again in the future we do not know how long this future ought to be it probably should be five years but who knows the problem is when the products in the basket change and the importance assigned to each product changes how can you compare the price index of five years ago with today s price index this debate has gone on for decades and it will go on for as long as there are economists who want to study the relationship between practically anything especially money and price changes a good book on this is by oskar morgenstern a student of mises but not a disciple on the accuracy of economic observations 1963 for a summary read this economists are probably less agreed on what constitutes money than they are about what constitutes the proper basket of goods to be used as representative of prices so i guarantee you economists do not agree on these matters at best there is a kind of sullen acceptance of a particular index the most popular index of prices in the united states is the consumer price index or cpi i prefer a rival index the median cpi published by the federal reserve bank of cleveland i think it is more accurate but i would not spend a lot of time trying to prove this the important thing is this you pick one index and then you follow the trend for that index the trend is what counts there can be revising with an index every few years some of which is legitimate but the general trend will reflect changes in the economy the trend will reflect how changes in the money supply change the prices of products and services that a large number of people purchase fluctuating prices there can be price inflation without an increase in the money supply this can happen during times of a disaster for example the price of goods rises during a hurricane especially goods such as bottled water gasoline and canned goods similarly in times of increasing productivity it is possible to have falling prices the money supply stays fairly constant and the number of goods and services increases this is a situation that we can call more goods chasing the same amount of money long term price deflation would exist in a free market economy that operated in terms of the legal requirement that all warehouse receipts for precious metals would be backed 100 by the metals promised by the warehouse receipts this would be a system of 100 reserve banking this is what murray rothbard favored prices might fall at 2 or 3 per annum this would be good for the consumer falling prices are a good thing if this comes as a result of increased productivity if you don t think so look at the price of electronic calculators or computers in almost every western country in the years following world war ii prices have risen in western industrial nations prices have risen at anywhere from 2 to 5 per annum this is because the money supply has increased in these nations a steady long term increase in the price level is always the result of an expansion of the monetary base by the central bank which is spent into circulation and then multiplies through the fractional reserve banking system no other explanation of long term price inflation has ever found any theoretical or statistical validation on this virtually all economists are agreed this is rare when an economist predicts inflation he means something greater than the normal 3 per annum whenever you read a prediction saying inflation ahead this prediction is saying nothing special if somebody says mass inflation ahead that is significant if somebody says hyperinflation ahead that is very significant in every case in the last half century anybody who made this prediction turned out to be wrong there is one prediction that has been even more wrong the prediction of falling prices the last time this happened was in the mid 1950 s it has not happened yet in the united states the consumer price index rose by 0 1 in 2008 the median cpi rose by 2 9 the big debate today is over what constitutes money if money is m 1 and m 1 rises there has been an increase in the money supply but if through a refusal of banks to lend the money multiplier falls the two forces can offset each other the multiplier falls when one of two things happens 1 the federal reserve increases the legal reserve requirement for banks 2 the federal reserve pays interest on reserves held at the fed this was never done in the united states until october 2008 it was not legally allowed to be done the law was changed so that it would be legal to do this beginning in october of 2011 without warning the federal reserve decided to jump the gun by three years it began paying interest to banks for reserves in the fall of 2008 excess reserves rose rapidly in the range of 800 billion this offset the effect of the increase in the money supply as denominated by m 1 you can see the two graphs here this was a deliberate change in federal reserve policy it was done specifically to neutralize the effect of the doubling of the monetary base by the federal reserve beginning in september 2008 the debate between those who predict price inflation and those who predict price deflation is operationally meaningless if we are only talking about 2 or 3 either way statistical sampling can produce an error that large also the weighing of the particular price index could easily have an error range this large those who predict mass inflation or hyperinflation are predicting something significant anyone who predicts 2 or 3 price deflation is not predicting anything very significant it can happen although it hasn t happened in over half a century the debate isn t about 2 or 3 either way the debate is about whether or not we are entering into a fundamentally different period of time in which the traditional 3 price inflation will be supplanted by something fundamentally different the case for the double digit price deflation is so weak that no economist predicts it in public i do not mean hardly any economists or not too many economists i mean no one academically trained with a phd in economics predicts price deflation comparable to that which took place from 1930 to 1933 anyone who predicts that and predicts that over several years has identified himself as not being a trained economist i m not exaggerating i really mean it no such economist exists if he does he has hidden himself well there are not many economists who predict price inflation of 10 per annum or higher there are a few but they are not famous and they are almost always austrian school economists why do they predict this because they look at the expansion of the monetary base and they know that the banks will eventually begin lending which will then multiply the money supply according to standard monetary theory regarding fractional reserve banking there is nothing unique about austrian school economics with respect to the operation of fractional reserve banking the main difference is this those austrian school economists who follow rothbard not all do argue that fractional reserve banking is immoral fractional reserves are a form of theft through fraud they also argue that fractional reserve banking leads to the boom bust cycle this makes them unique but there is nothing unique about the analysis of how the system operates as presented in rothbard s book the mystery of banking gold vs deflation within the hard money movement there are a few people following john exter who predict price deflation and a rise in the price of gold i have believed for 35 years that this system cannot be defended if there is severe price deflation then the hardest money asset in the world is the currency that is being deflated if there is a shrinking money supply there will be a shrinking price level hard money in this situation is the national currency that is shrinking gold would fall under such a currency system there is no such currency the fact that some asset prices fall in a time of price deflation only means that these prices were imputed prices which means that the last transaction sets the prices this is true of stock prices this is true of commodity prices in a futures market but when a particular commodity or product is bought on a regular basis such as food in a supermarket the possibility of error in forecasting falls remarkably this is because people buy the products on a regular basis and so those who imputed future prices based on the latest price probably will not make a serious mistake either up or down it will be confirmed in the market shortly prices of homes can go up or down rapidly and shortly but this is because people rarely sell their homes the price of a house down the block is imputed to all the houses on the block that can happen at any time the money supply does not shrink just because somebody s house falls in price because somebody else s house down the block sold for 10 less this year than it did last year the money supply has not changed at all the money is in somebody s bank account if one person loses money in a transaction somebody else will be able to buy whatever it was that fell in price he will buy it because he has money in a bank account when he writes a check to buy the item that money is transferred to the seller s bank account the money supply has not changed it is possible that capital assets can fall in price because of leverage in the previous boom period in other words people made contracts that they cannot fulfill when the banks do this and they do not fulfill them and they are allowed to go bankrupt this does shrink the money supply this happened in 1930 33 but the point is the central bank does not allow banks to go bankrupt in this way any longer the money supply generated by the banking system as a whole does not change because bank a goes bankrupt and its assets are bought by bank b whenever there is a threat that there will be a contraction of the money supply because banks default on all debt the central bank intervenes so does the federal deposit insurance corporation which arranges that the depositors assets are transferred to another bank the depositors are protected and their deposits continue to remain the basis of an expansion of loans one more time the money supply does not shrink because a bank goes belly up the central bank always intervenes to make certain that the money supply does not shrink it has not shrunk so far because the affected operational supply of excess reserves has increased because the federal reserve system changed its policy and began paying interest on reserves does not change the fact that the monetary base has doubled it does not change the fact that the money supply whether m 1 m 2 or mzm will rise rapidly when banks begin lending the money that presently is tied up at the federal reserve system the banks will begin lending soon because the federal reserve system is now paying 1 10 of 1 per annum on this money the banks are losing money hand over fist because they have to pay depositors a rate of interest and they are not lending the money at the fed at a higher rate of interest so they cannot make any profit on the difference between the interest rate to the borrower and the interest rate to the depositor money and prices i hope this clears up some of the debate between those who predict serious price inflation and those who predict serious price deflation when i say serious i mean at least 10 per annum either way if somebody is predicting 2 price inflation and someone else is predicting 2 price deflation flip a coin if somebody is predicting serious price deflation or serious price inflation make that person answer this question under your scenario what is the relationship among the monetary base the money supply and prices everyone in this debate knows that the monetary base has doubled an unresolved question is this will the banks lend the money that is presently at the federal reserve in the form of excess reserves earning one tenth of one percent then ask this when the banks pull their money out of the fed when the economy revives or else they are going bust because of interest paid to depositors and when that money gets to the general public what will be the result price inflation or price deflation make certain that these are the two issues that the person who predicts either serious price inflation or serious price deflation deals with in print if you don t understand his answer you can be pretty sure that he doesn t either by the way the deflationists have not had their prediction come true in a single year since 1967 when i started tracking this debate they may go into rapturous joy if in 2009 the cpi falls by 1 if it does which i doubt we were right but the dollar was worth over six times as much in 1967 when j irving weiss deflationist martin weiss s father first presented his deflationist prediction at the very first gold investment conference sponsored by harry schultz which i attended the dollar was almost five times as high when john exter pitched his theory in 1973 you can verify these numbers here they use the cpi as the index when prices fall by 10 or more per annum for three consecutive years i will be impressed even 5 will get my attention until then let me say this the deflationists never changing prediction has been wrong since 1967 conclusion what i am saying is this prices are more likely to rise by 10 or more for three consecutive years before they fall by 5 for three consecutive years i will up the ante they are more likely to rise by 20 than fall by 5 for three consecutive years for more evidence from a retired professor of finance click here _________________________ published on

the markets continue to seem optimistic the strength of the u s flash offered a contrast to most high income regions the and the dow jones advanced last week after falling the previous week for the first time since early october benchmark 10 year bond yields were mixed asia pacific experienced small declines as did the core in europe the periphery of europe and the u s saw modest increases on the month the backing up the peripheral yields was striking led the way with a 30 bp increase rose by about 18 bp even after trump signed the bills ostensibly to protect hong kong and the subsequent threats by china many still see a trade deal in the making as both sides seem to want it expectations have been scaled back in terms of substance some think an announcement is possible as early as the coming days the market already appears to be pricing in the end to the escalation of the tariff battle the key to the response could be the extent of the roll back there is some hope after last week s unscheduled talks between the u s canada and mexico that the u s house of representatives could signal the intention of bringing the usmca to a vote this would likely mean that the democratic leadership thinks it has the vote to approve it the u s dollar was mixed but the underlying tone remains firm it finished last week near key levels against the jpy109 50 1 10 and chf1 0030 remains supported by speculation that the tories can secure a parliamentary majority at the december 12 election the bled lower and has fallen for four consecutive weeks dragged down especially by latin america the jp morgan emerging market currency index fell nearly 0 4 last week its fifth straight weekly decline dollar index the reached its highest level 98 55 since mid october before reversing lower in the waning hours of the last session of november thin markets and month end considerations may have exaggerated the decline it nearly wiped out the week s gains leaving the dollar index three thousandths of an index point higher on the week initial support is seen near 98 00 and a break of the 97 70 area would warn that of a corrective phase rather than just consolidation on the other hand a move above 98 70 would signal a test on the october 1 high around 99 50 the slow stochastics did not confirm last week s high though the macd continues to trend higher the dollar index gained a little less than 1 in november after losing 2 in october euro the single currency posted a potential reversal ahead of the weekend by making new low since october 10 1 0980 before rallying through the previous session high a little below 1 1020 and closing near the highs in candlestick terms it may be a bullish hammer however thin markets and month end flows caution against reading too much into it news of the change in spd leadership has increased the risk that the german government falls but on balance it seems more likely to renegotiate the terms of the coalition the party will take a formal vote at the end of next week for the week the euro finished three hundredths of a cent lower and 1 2 weaker on the month it fell by 2 3 in october the euro has not been above 1 1030 since november 25 the month s downtrend line starts december near 1 1060 the macd and slow stochastics are above where they were in the middle of the month not yet confirming last week s low yen the dollar s six session streak against the yen the longest of the year ended while u s markets were closed for america s thanksgiving it made new six month highs before the weekend jpy109 65 before coming off jpy109 40 the dollar finished two hundredths of a yen lower on the session and three quarters of a percent higher on the week the greenback rose 1 35 against the yen in november the macd and slow stochastics give no reason not to look for a further advance with jpy110 00 being the next important chart point the cautionary note comes from the upper bollinger band which begins the new week near jpy109 60 sterling the british pound gained 0 7 last week completely recouping the 0 5 lost the previous week it was virtually flat in november losing 17 100 of a penny after gaining 5 3 in october since the middle of october it has chopped between 1 28 and 1 30 sterling recorded an outside up day in the middle of the last week but did not signal a break of the range many investors appear to be confident that the tories will win the december 12 election and that the uk will leave the eu by the end of january the broad sideways movement has neutered the momentum indicators after the election is out of the way investors attention may turn to the economy which is weakening canadian dollar the u s dollar spent last week within 20 25 pips of 1 3300 neither the end of the rail strike in canada nor the optimism about the usmca had much impact the technical indicators suggest the next move will be a weaker greenback the macds have flatlined near its highs and the slow stochastics are rolling over the u s dollar rose almost 1 in november after falling by about 1 in the previous two months initial support is seen near cad1 3250 the bank of canada is widely expected to restate its neutrality after its policymaking meeting on december 4 however the jobs data a couple days may help investors locate the bar to a cut australian dollar the could not distance itself from the 0 6770 support area it fell 0 35 to extend its losing streak to the fourth consecutive week the price action and the technical indicators give little reason to think that a low is in place though the slow stochastics is overextended a test on the lower bollinger band still allows lower levels 0 6735 the early august and october lows were set near 0 6670 and are increasingly coming into view mexican peso the u s dollar rose against the for the fourth week in the past five its 0 8 rise last week accounted for half of its gain 1 55 for november the momentum indicators suggest there is scope for more gains a convincing break of the mxn19 64 area which was flirted with last week and houses the upper bollinger band would complete a potential rounded bottom it projects toward mxn20 20 though the october high around mxn19 86 may be the first hurdle the peso partly serves as the liquid accessible proxy for emerging markets and now latam currencies and s central banks intervened last week to support their currencies those two and the suffered the largest losses among emerging market currencies initial dollar support is seen near mxn19 40 chinese yuan the dollar drifted lower against the last week posting losses of less than 0 1 in four of the five sessions for the entire month of november the dollar was barely changed even after trump signed the hong kong bills volatility did not rise and the yuan did not weaken the dollar has traded in cny7 00 cny7 05 range over the past couple of weeks the stronger than expected may be more of an equity than a currency story the rallied earlier this year but november was the third consecutive monthly decline while the losses have been modest 1 2 of this run in stands in contrast most other markets the slipped about 0 2 in november but over the past three months is up about 5 5 gold edged about 2 an ounce higher last week support around 1450 has been tested several times and although the downside momentum has been exhausted the has been little interest in the upside a move now above 1468 1470 could spur some technical buying the 1480 area corresponds to the neckline of a potential double bottom which would project toward 1510 the macd has flatlined in oversold territory the slow stochastics are curling up from higher levels oil thin markets may have exacerbated the drop in before the weekend the little more than 5 decline was the largest in two months the unexpected rise in the u s inventories did not help matters but it seemed to have been the saudi s complaint on the eve of next week s that sent prices reeling saudi arabia indicated its frustration of bearing the cost of supply cuts this may be a negotiating ploy even as prices climbed over the last couple of weeks we have read the technical indicators as favoring caution the macd and slow stochastics continue to gradually rollover a break of the 54 70 area could signal another dollar decline before stronger support is found u s rates the u s yield traded in about a 6 5 bp range last week 1 73 1 795 it was the narrowest range in at least six months the yield rose by 8 5 bp last month it was the third monthly increase the momentum indicators of the december note futures contract favors the downside of prices warning of the risk of yields may test the recent highs a little below 2 the u s yield curve 10y looks poised to re steepen it peaked near the middle of november near 27 bp and fell a little below 15 bp by late in the month s p 500 the s p 500 rose about 1 last week despite the 0 4 decline before the weekend to bring the monthly advance to 3 4 the small gap created by the higher opening at midweek was closed after thursday s thanksgiving holiday we continue to suspect the market is getting ahead of itself and still see the momentum indicators as stretched the s p 500 gapped higher to start the week and that gap 3112 9 3117 8 filling that gap would require taking out the two month uptrend line 3125 on december 2

interview with luis de guindos vice president of the ecb conducted by pablo rodríguez suanzes on 25 november 2019 how are you finding life in frankfurt frankfurt is a nice city i like it the ecb is the most important institution in the framework of the eu and of the euro area in particular exposure to the public is very different to when you re in government here the relationship is mainly with the european parliament through hearings and with the public through speeches is my life better it s different how do you feel about not being able to speak as freely as before i can keep speaking normally i still attend the economic and financial affairs council ecofin each week we have discussions in various forums on issues around monetary and economic policy and financial stability so i have something to offer but my contributions aren t political do you miss it i don t miss anything that was my job for six years i m not at all bored here when and why did you decide you wanted to try to become the vice president of the ecb i wanted to leave the government at the end of its first term i spoke to president rajoy and we said it could be a possibility and it was very attractive to me it s the most important institution in the euro area very prestigious it takes very significant decisions which made it an extremely attractive proposition how do you explain the arrival of people like you or christine lagarde who have a different profile to the one that ecb executive board members have traditionally had i don t think anything was predetermined or premeditated members of the governing council have different profiles and each of them contributes according to their experience i contribute my knowledge of the european economy and the financial system and my experience taking decisions when the spanish economy was at its most delicate moment what role does politics play in the ecb the 25 members of the governing council don t always agree although many of the decisions we take are unanimous there are those who think that the situation requires further measures and others who think we have already gone too far we look for a consensus the decisions are very democratic one governor one vote but actually taking a vote is an exception not the rule in recent months there has been very strong unprecedented public criticism i m not at all concerned by the fact that there are differing views that s healthy and it s normal because there are 25 of us but what has been happening in recent months has not been very helpful it hasn t undermined the effectiveness of the september package of measures because it went ahead as planned but it s much better to be united we are a collegial institution and once we have reached an agreement everyone should defend it this is not to say for example that i agreed with every element of the package but once something has been approved i defend it is the consensus broken no this is actually one of the top priorities of the new president each of us will have our own ideas about the situation and the appropriate measures to take that s one thing but it s something else entirely to air disagreements in public you and mr draghi have met at various forums since 2011 how was the past year when you were working side by side mario draghi will go down in history as one of the founding fathers of the euro even though he isn t one in the strictest sense there were two stages to his presidency the first was saving the euro with his famous whatever it takes the second was fighting deflation these were his two main interventions and he was successful in both he will be remembered very positively when he uttered those famous words in london in 2012 he changed the outlook in the euro area the banking union was implemented right away four or five years ago we were facing the risk of deflation and the asset purchase programme was launched which brought the ecb in line with other central banks mario draghi has modernised the instruments of monetary policy despite this his critics point to the fact that he has left behind a european economy that is drugged with low growth rates at zero and inflation very far from the objective monetary policy is not the reason for this it s been the main driver of the economic recovery and growth in europe 11 million jobs have been created in no small part thanks to monetary policy this is the main thing although there are collateral effects the problem we have at the moment is that these monetary policy decisions need to be complemented by other instruments sometimes it seemed like you were not exactly among mr draghi s most ardent supporters i have always supported president draghi but when you heard him being talked about as the saviour of the euro or the person who had rescued spain it didn t sit well with you well he didn t see it like that either in spain we rescued ourselves off our own backs with the help of our european partners including the ecb mr draghi made a key contribution but there s no single saviour here it was a set of circumstances and a matter of everyone carrying out their responsibilities in their individual roles as vice president will you continue to appear alongside president lagarde i have no idea i suppose it will continue like that it s an unwritten rule a tradition traditions can change but they can also be of value brexit trade and currency wars geopolitical tensions all of this in an environment of lower growth zero rates and stimulus plans when you were in government you joked that you slept like a baby in that you woke up crying every two hours how are you sleeping now well very well i wouldn t wish what happened in 2012 on my worst enemy the situation now is totally different back then we were on the brink of collapse the spanish economy the italian economy doubts about the integrity of the euro the situation of the spanish banking industry was terrifying and contagion was spreading to the treasury it was a dramatic situation i don t think there is going to be a recession in europe that s very unlikely but yes i am worried that we will have two or three years of subdued growth of below potential growth that is what is worrying me at the moment and that this subdued growth may mean that the price stability objective is not met monetary policy is not the philosopher s stone it cannot be used to fix everything other policies are needed so do you echo the calls of presidents draghi and lagarde for countries with fiscal space above all germany to boost spending and investment this is important yes but my proposal goes further than that our current system of national fiscal policies and national budgets with a set of rules like the stability and growth pact is not sufficient we need a fiscal instrument of the sort proposed by president macron a few years ago an instrument that has the capacity to act countercyclically and that complements monetary policy but it s something you were already asking for when you were a minister and it s not happening now and even in the best of cases it won t happen for another four or five years and without that level of firepower we have to call for it because it is sensible it is not a question of whether it is possible but rather one of reality it would be very important for the entire euro area and i am convinced that it will come about sooner rather than later what are your thoughts on the spanish economy the spanish economy is doing well it is competitive and enjoying above average growth and that is the result of the reforms in 2012 and 2013 and society s efforts it is doing well that s the truth it has been affected by the economic slowdown like the rest of the euro area but growth is still at 2 why the financial sector was cleaned up and the economy is now competitive those are the two reasons why it is doing better spain didn t have any issues during the growth phase of the cycle but now we are maybe seeing the effects of not having made any reforms in recent years deferred budgets or adjusted deficits during growth periods my recommendation is for the euro area as a whole not just for spain if you have debt approaching 100 of gdp you have to reduce it to be less vulnerable are you worried by the political uncertainty political uncertainty is an important factor because we always need stable governments capable of taking action and this is of course quite obvious we don t have the political stability necessary to put into place the necessary measures and policies including a budget what do they think here in frankfurt about the fact that the budget has been deferred since the time when you were still a minister spain has continued to reduce its public debt it could have been reduced more but it could also have been reduced less in any case there is one fundamental factor the growth differential in the spanish economy this now comes from a financial sector that doesn t have the same doubts hanging over it as it did five to seven years ago and it is competitive the most important thing in contrast to the previous and other growth cycles is that it is growing without an increase in loans and without a real estate bubble with lending growth that is below nominal gdp and a current account surplus in the balance of payments as long as these two things continue the spanish economy will keep growing faster than the rest the recommendation which is also valid for portugal greece and ireland and even for italy is this stabilise the banking sector and the credit markets and maintain competitiveness then you will do better than average the public message is quite clear are there more discreet messages in private no none i say the same thing in public that i do in private have the ecb s non standard measures run their course no we can still increase bond purchases or lower interest rates further which means that we still have the same tools available what is happening is that the secondary effects are becoming more tangible and each measure has less of a return i look at the effects and these can vary greatly i am worried by risk taking in the asset management sector against the background of low interest rates it is a matter of concern for me banks are now better capitalised they have more liquidity and they are much safer than they were but they face low profitability which is a problem supervision is centralised and is more suitable than when it was the remit of national authorities but in the area of asset management and investment funds what we see is that in a low interest rate environment their investment strategy always moves towards increased risk in the sense of assets with potentially greater returns and greater risks but that are less liquid and there is also more leveraging not to the extent seen in the united states but still more than before and the supervision in this sector is not comparable with that in the banking sector there is a risk if they are asked for units to be paid out they have to do so within two or three days i see a potential risk of liquidity imbalance that is what worries me the most at the moment and while it may not technically be a secondary effect of monetary policy because its causes are structural i am concerned by the banking sector s low profitability are you in favour of changing or widening the ecb s mandate or of defining more precisely what is below but close to 2 we have to look at that yes the ecb set out its strategy in 1998 and revised it in 2003 and while it can t be a change of mandate since that is defined in the treaty we could revisit the definition of price stability and what are the steps to achieve that i am in favour of starting the discussion but we haven t had it the president has announced it but this is not a matter of one or two governing council meetings it is something that must be done without haste but decisively what about helicopter money i e giving money directly to citizens no that has never been considered but should it be considered just like changing the mandate no absolutely not there is a lot of talk currently about japanification about secular stagnation add to this demographics and the fact that there is a smaller working population with lower productivity than before what scares you the most from a journalistic standpoint talking about japanification is attractive but there are actually many differences while european demographics are not brilliant they cannot be compared with japan the situation facing banks here is not as bad no real estate bubble has burst here the way it did there the parallels are in low inflation low interest rates and low growth but the outlooks are different and i don t think that the term really applies to the european economy will edis be complete when you leave office yes i think it will and quite a few years before that in fact one of the german proposals is to limit the amount of sovereign debt held by financial entities spain has experienced precisely that with only national entities continuing to buy public debt at the same rate does that seem reasonable to you it s a starting point completing edis is crucial but we also have to take measures simultaneously to limit how much risk is generated by certain countries in my experience with banco popular and the savings banks the problem wasn t public debt the underlying problem was other types of loans that led to solvency problems does the issue with popular villarejo and bbva bother you we do not comment on specific situations of course european banking supervision and risk surveillance is on the lookout for anything that might have an effect on financial stability but so far we have not seen anything
in a move to reverse the trend of de industrialisation the pti government announced on nov 19 a tariff policy that will be effective from next financial year its salient features include a shift from the current focus on revenue collection to an industrial growth oriented taxation policy besides strategic tariff protection to infant and import substitution industries with timelines to make them competitive the tariff policy will be shaped by intensive interaction among various ministries and institutions rather than a single agency entrusted to boost revenues the federal board of revenue fbr will no longer set the recommended tariff rates for approval by the cabinet instead the responsibility will be delegated to a newly created tariff policy board headed by the commerce minister or adviser the board will comprise the chairman of the tariff commission and representatives of the fbr and relevant ministries the board will oversee the implementation of the policy supported by the proposed tariff policy centre serving as its secretariat the new arrangement may be seen as part of the pti s institutional reforms earlier the government had decided to ease control over the financial releases for the public sector development programme psdp by reducing the involvement of the finance ministry prolonged de industrialisation has resulted in sluggish exports and unaffordable import costs given the past experience when protecting the infant industry led to production inefficiencies and rent seeking the proposed policy will provide a time bound strategic protection to the domestic industry during the infancy phase to promote competitive import substitution it will be phased out to make the industry eventually competitive for export oriented production without improving the quality of governance there are risks in the time bound strategic protection for which strict oversight is required the solution lies in nurturing free trade within the national frontiers with required restricted international trade practices for different phases of industrial development for this to happen domestic market reforms have to be expedited it is industry that leads growth in all segments of the economy prolonged de industrialisation has resulted in sluggish exports of manufactured goods unaffordable levels of imports record high foreign debts and erratic economic growth domestic production must increase to reduce dependence on foreign goods tariffs on imported raw materials and intermediate and capital goods proposed to be gradually reduced may help boost domestic production but will raise the import bill the recurring external sector crisis has brought pressure on the government to begin focusing on the much needed trade related industrial investment recently the state bank of pakistan sbp recommended to the government that it should put in place a coherent industrial policy on an immediate priority aware of its obligation though constrained by the stability agenda the government had recently tasked the ministries of industries and commerce to come up with a 10 year draft industrial policy by nov 30 pakistan s former ambassador to the world trade organisation dr manzoor ahmed says the government should ask some pertinent questions while formulating the industrial policy why is pakistan not part of the global value production chain which now forms a major share in global exports how can the new policy measures discard anti technology bias why is the share of engineering goods in the country s exports less than 0 2 per cent compared to india s 25pc with an oblique reference to the failure of pakistan s previous industrial policy he points out that formulating industrial policy is getting out of fashion in many countries that have concluded after much debate that market failures are less damaging than government failures the pti government is banking on chinese investment under the second phase of the china pakistan economic corridor cpec which is focused on industrialisation agriculture development and some initiatives for social uplift but cpec is beset with its own problems speaking at the woodrow wilson centre in

repay loans in time china was also determined to build capabilities of pakistani businesses and industries to boost productivity that he asserts will ultimately help boost pakistan s exports the chinese envoy reportedly expressed concerns about the inability of three key ministries communications railways and planning and development to make stick to timelines the appointment of asad umar as minister for planning and development will however make a difference the critical question here is will chinese investment ultimately lead to the balancing of the external trade it is in the interest of both sides to reduce imbalances in the bilateral trade with an initial focus on pakistani exports to china to facilitate the repayment of cpec related debts while the employment of chinese men and material needs to be minimised to control the dollar yuan cost of projects so far cpec projects have contributed to a surge in foreign debts the production of diverse goods and services is a nature

washington president donald trump announced plans monday dec 2 to resurrect tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports from brazil and argentina stunning political and industry leaders in those countries and extending the white house s adversarial trade tactics to new fronts trump took aim at both nations on twitter claiming that the devaluation of their currencies was hurting american farmers though it was unclear what specifically triggered the announcement he then directed his attention to the federal reserve which he has frequently slammed for not cutting rates brazil and argentina have been presiding over a massive devaluation of their currencies which is not good for our farmers trump said in an early morning tweet he added that the u s s central bank should act so that countries of which there are many no longer take advantage of our strong dollar by further devaluing their currencies this makes it very hard for our farmers to fairly export their goods lower rates loosen fed reserve should likewise act so that countries of which there are many no longer take advantage of our strong dollar by further devaluing their currencies this makes it very hard for our manufactures farmers to fairly export their goods lower rates loosen fed donald j trump realdonaldtrump december 2 2019 advertisement the surprise announcement came after it appeared as though the white house was preparing to dial back its aggressive trade approach in the lead up to next year s election the administration appeared close to a deal with house democrats to revamp the north american free trade agreement and tensions with china had eased in recent weeks trump s tweets were not accompanied by any announcement from the commerce department or the u s trade representative announcing the change more formally the tariffs took aim at one of the most vital industries in brazil at a particularly vulnerable moment unemployment is above 10 percent and the economy has stalled the steel industry long one of the nation s economic engines has been looking increasingly wobbly as well slashing growth projections earlier this year brazilian steel exports to the u s accounted for roughly 2 6 billion last year making the united states one of brazil s biggest markets for steel and analysts expected the tariffs to be painful in argentina where steel and aluminum exports represent roughly 700 million the unexpected news comes as the nation is undergoing a transition of power if the tariffs persist they will be one of the earliest diplomatic tests to face the incoming presidency of alberto fernández a leftist politician who will take office within a week before leaving the white house for a trip to a nato gathering in london trump told reporters he had given brazil and argentina a big break on tariffs but now i m taking that break off it s very unfair to our manufacturers and very unfair to our farmers trump said our steel companies will be very happy and our farmers will be very happy advertisement in brazil the tariffs announcement stunned officials who for nearly a year have sought to develop closer ties with the united states particularly brazilian president jair bolsonaro nicknamed by some as the trump of the tropics bolsonaro has repeatedly praised trump mimicked his rhetoric and even tried to install his son as the ambassador to the united states but on monday bolsonaro appeared taken by surprise i m going to speak with paulo guedes he told several reporters outside the presidential palace referring to the country s finance minister aluminum i m going to speak with paulo guedes now if necessary i ll call trump i have an open channel with him later in the day the brazilian foreign ministry issued a statement saying it acknowledged president trump s declaration over the possible imposition of tariffs and that the government was in touch with officials in washington the brazilian government will work to defend brazilian commercial interests and facilitate commerce with the united states with a view to widen the commercial exchange and deepen the bilateral relationship to the benefit of both countries the statement said the news was met by confusion in the brazilian steel sector the brazilian steel institute which represents most of the country s steel companies said it was perplexed not only by the tariffs but by trump s accusations that the government was trying to artificially devalue the brazilian currency related at least 19 killed as mexican cartel battles police and army south of u s border mexico s foreign minister plans to meet the u s attorney general over trump s plan to designate mexican cartels as terrorist groups police at least 11 injured in shooting in new orleans the new orleans police department reports that 11 people two in critical condition were shot on the popular canal street just after 3 a m today the exchange rate in the country is free the institute said in a statement the decision to tax brazilian steel as a way to compensate the american worker is a retaliation against brazil and not consistent with the partnership between the two countries advertisement trump s tweets also referenced wall street s gains u s markets are up as much as 21 since the announcement of tariffs on 3 1 2018 he wrote suggesting he s not too concerned about a market blowback if he ratchets up trade tensions david wessel director of the hutchins center on fiscal and monetary policy at the brookings institution said the markets have been hopeful that the trade war may soon end making the timing of trump s announcement all the more surprising rattling the trade war saber which may play well with his base seems to me like it is likely to hurt the markets wessel said by midmorning monday the major u s indexes were in negative territory the dow jones industrial average was off roughly 0 7 the standard poor s 500 was 0 7 in the red and the nasdaq composite was down roughly 1 percent trump also appeared to push for a two pronged approach to weakening the u s dollar through action by the fed and by dealing hits to foreign countries the president doesn t seem to see any contradiction between his frequent assertions that the u s is the strongest economy in the world and his insistence that in such circumstances the u s dollar should be going down wessel said some analysts in washington suggested that trump s punitive actions on brazil and argentina were rooted in the president s larger trade war with china which has become central to his reelection effort as he seeks to negotiate a trade deal with the world s second largest economic power in 2020 yet china has reacted to trump s higher tariffs on u s agricultural products by importing more soybeans from those two south american nations the analysts said and the president is now attempting to exert leverage on brasilia and buenos aires in a bid to limit their cooperation with beijing i don t think this has a whole lot to do with steel this is a china issue said fernando cutz a western hemisphere expert at the cohen group who served on the national security council under both president barack obama and trump if ustr wants to maximize a trade deal with china they need to put pressure on china but if china figures out how to replace the u s markets with brazil and argentina that s not creating pressure advertisement the treasury department twice each year issues a report that looks at the currency policies of all major economies to determine whether any nation is improperly manipulating its currency this is at least the second time that trump has made a declaration about another nation s policies that did not mesh with his own treasury department s formal assessment in august he declared that china had been manipulating its currency forcing treasury secretary steven mnuchin to scramble and assert the same even though treasury had not found china to be manipulating its currency in its official evaluation and in the latest report released in may treasury did not allege brazil or argentina had done anything improper in handling their currencies instead that report said that the u s dollar had strengthened against the currencies of brazil and india as external pressures on many emerging markets intensified in the midst of crises in argentina and turkey monday s directive marks the latest twist in trump s trade war which has become a major fixture of his foreign and economic policies trump has said he looked to clinch a trade deal with china this year but those talks have unraveled on multiple occasions trump is now focused on a partial trade deal which he has referred to as phase one and which would include large purchases of u s farm products by beijing the next potential deadline that could bring the united states and china to the table comes dec 15 when trump s next round of tariffs is scheduled to affect about 160 billion in chinese goods a deal could make those levies disappear according to sources familiar with the talks earlier in trump s presidency in march 2018 top steel suppliers including brazil south korea and japan complained that the office of the u s trade representative had yet to establish a process for countries to apply for tariff exemptions just days before tariffs on foreign made steel and aluminum were scheduled to take effect at the time brazil was the no 2 steel supplier to the united states in 2017 the u s imported 34 6 million metric tons of steel from 85 countries trump imposed the steel and aluminum tariffs after his commerce department found that the large amount of these imports posed a threat to the national security of the united states trump has tried to use these and other tariffs as leverage against other countries to change their trade policies with mixed success in june trump threatened to impose tariffs on mexican goods and even shut down the u s border if more wasn t done to crack down on migrant crossings this did prompt mexico to negotiate and make some changes a response white house officials felt validated the hardball tactics advertisement initially the steel and aluminum tariffs trump imposed seemed to lead to a brief revival of the domestic steel industry leading companies to expand hiring as prices increased but there are signs that this renaissance was short lived and some plants have begun cutting workers amid a slump in stock values and steel prices trump and bolsonaro have shared a particular bond that spans their shared antagonism of the news media to massive fires in the amazon rainforest recently trump pledged to take brazil s side as bolsonaro said the powerful group of seven countries were criticizing his government s response to the fires when french president emmanuel macron announced in august that g 7 member nations had approved a 22 million emergency aid package to help combat the fires the trump administration did not give its support saying that any solution should be done in consultation with brazil trump later praised bolsonaro for working very hard on the amazon fires and in all respects doing a great job for the people of brazil this article was written by rachel siegel david nakamura and terrence mccoy reporters for the washington post the washington post s david j lynch in washington and heloisa traiano in

these decisions will set up the us economy for one of the most punishing downturns in history i look at our fiscal monetary mix it s the most stimulative that i ve ever seen again economically adjusted no wonder the stock market is at new highs it s literally the most conducive environment certainly in the short run for economic growth and strength that i ve ever seen you add on that an 11 budget deficit in china the second largest economy and 3 because the world is looking for yield companies can sell dreams rather than earnings the number of companies that produce earnings is the lowest since the dot com bubble in terms of their need because you can sell a dream as a result of the accumulation of the money at the top and technology we have a situation where naturally those who have a lot of money also have a lot of money in credit but it doesn t trickle down and as a result we have a situation with a large wealth gap in my opinion we re near the end in the late stages of our reserve currency system it s a fiat monetary system not only do we have negative rates but we re going to have much bigger deficits and that s not half the story because the larger story is the unfunded liabilities those are pension liabilities and debt liabilities the situation will be even worse when the cycle turns and we re plunged into a punishing economic downturn the system doesn t work it s gone mad then the reason the system is broken is because it s not an equal opportunity system there are justifiable complaints about education it needs to be reformed in a way that works better we can increase the size of the pie in the same way that you can divide it better twenty years ago japan medicinalized it by implementing a form of it with the boj now we re at the point where it s so wildly accepted that we sugar coat it and put it in gummy bear form and it s this wildly accepted next stage that there s a problem the typical recession means the budget deficit should increase by 10 to 30 clearly asset prices today whether it s us stocks or its interest rates or its the dollar it s all priced off of in my opinion a 5 budget deficit with this incredibly overly stimulative fiscal policy combined with overly stimulating monetary policy is creating this us exceptionalism that one day like if we normalized our deficit to levels more popular in europe we d see completely different valuations for the sock market the dollar etc two hedge fund icons bridgewater founder ray dalio and paul tudor jones joined yahoo finance for the 2nd annual greenwich investment forum earlier this month speaking directly after connecticut gov new lamont with whom dalio is working to bolster connecticut s schools via a 100 million gift the largest charitable gift the state has ever received ptj and dalio focused their fireside chat onas dalio warned after all didn t trump convince the republican party once the party of fiscal piety that 5 budget deficits 10 years into an economic rebound are necessary to protect the economy similarly didn t he also convince the fed through great moral suasion that returning to real negative rates with unemployment at 50 year lows was a necessity which is why ptj always laughs when jerome powell is quizzed about financial conditions and whether he sees bubbles anywhere because at this point clearly the low interest rate policy we re pursuing is creating an excess and that excess is in our public deficits which at the current pace in less than ten years we will have exceeded the threshold where greece had its issues ptj said and when we look abroad the full scope of this heady fiscal monetary mix becomes even more obvious dalio jumps in today the number of companies producing earnings is the lowest since the dot com bubble because companies can sell dreams rather than earnings that s thanks to the 15 trillion sloshing around the financial system that has been injected by central banksdalio then moved on to highlighting his 1930s hypothesis all of this is happening at a time when according to dalio the current dollar centric global reserve system is nearing its end war can take several different forms as most americans are no doubt aware at this point as dalio explained there s a trade war a technology war a geopolitical war and there could be a capital war it s not just the budget hole there are also pension shortfalls and other obligations that the federal government must backstop we have a lot of ious that are either going to be funded by tax increases or spending cuts if we don t find a way to fix the system and fix wealth inequality bad things are going to happen but dalio insists that increasing the size and distribution of the pie is still possible ptj grabbed the microphone next to share a few thoughts on mmt and some of the dems who are running in the primary jones said mmt reminds him of the fight to legalize marijuana because 30 years it would have been dismissed as a crackpot theory but now it s being taken seriously according to an internal poll at jones s firm if trump wins reelection the s p 500 could hit 3 500 but if warren is elected we could go as low as 2 400 to 2 500 biden and buttigieg represent a middle ground with the s p 500 likely reversing some of its recent gains but only enough to bring us back down to like 2 700 around where we started 2019 still when we look at the biggest factor influencing markets ptj insists it s not markets but the 5 budget deficit in the us that has caused us stocks to outperform after a brief discussion of his charity efforts in the state dalio said that much of the source of inequality lies in the public education system we need to re engineered public education in a way that promotes more wide spread economic performance and that might involve letting the academics and policy wonks who are at the forefront take the reins but the stakes are so high that whatever the cost of reform the us will likely want to pay because if we don t an excerpt from the interview is below for the full interview please click here

welcome to the latest front in president trump s trade battle a currency war trump says his latest tariffs announced on his twitter feed at 5 59 a m monday are aimed at brazil and argentina this isn t the first time trump has targeted the steel and aluminum exports from these countries to u s markets he has been doing that since spring 2018 but there are two aspects of trump s early morning tweets that are different this time and they are giving wall street business leaders and many foreign leaders pause first is a reminder to the world that trump continues to believe that tariffs work contrary to the popular narrative on wall street heading into the thanksgiving holiday trump has not hit the pause button on tariffs as some sort of grand strategy to keep the economy humming before the election advertisement second is trump s new rationale for his tariffs he claims that the two south american nations are manipulating their currencies and deserve to be punished that s very different from what trump said in 2018 when he first imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and it marks the latest unpredictable trade shock from the white house as business leaders are begging for more certainty brazil and argentina have been presiding over a massive devaluation of their currencies which is not good for our farmers trump tweeted therefore effective immediately i will restore the tariffs on all steel aluminum that is shipped into the u s from those countries in announcing the new tariffs trump also called on the u s federal reserve to lower interest rates in a way that could weaken the u s dollar pushing the central bank to take the type of action he has criticized other countries for doing advertisement mere hours after trump tweeted about the fresh tariffs his commerce secretary wilbur ross warned that other nations could be next they are not the only one where there are currency issues ross said in an appearance on fox business stocks fell as investors digested this latest twist with the dow jones industrial average losing 268 points trump initially said in march 2018 that he was putting tariffs on virtually all cheap foreign steel and aluminum coming into the u s market for national security reasons he argued that the united states needed to keep domestic steel and aluminum production strong to build military equipment there were a lot of objections to this rationale especially from longtime u s allies such as canada which also faced tariffs for about a year before trump pulled back advertisement while canada and europe balked at trump s metals tariffs brazil and argentina caved the two south american nations agreed to the trump administration s demands to restrict how much steel and aluminum they sold the united states through the use of a formal quota now trump is brushing aside national security and claiming this is all about a currency war this is going to help confirm people s beliefs that it is very very difficult to trust president trump to stick by a deal on trade said phil levy an economist who worked on trade in the george w bush administration all of this is coming at a critical time u s businesses have curtailed investments for the past two quarters largely because business leaders say they are spooked by trump s unpredictable trade war and u s manufacturing contracted in november for the fourth straight month according to the latest institute for supply management survey advertisement the tipping point many chief executives say was in late may when trump threatened to impose tariffs on all imports from mexico unless the mexican government took dramatic steps to stem migration across the southern u s border suddenly tariffs were tied not just to economic security but to immigration trump ultimately backed away from the tariffs after mexican officials agreed to take strong measures at the border but the threat drew an outcry from many including gop lawmakers and some damage was already done as chief executives went into wait and see mode many have sat on their cash instead of spending it now trump is showing a willingness to impose tariffs for yet another reason currency moves opening the door to more action potentially against china trump argues that other countries are intentionally weakening their currencies to make their goods cheaper on the world market giving those nations a trading edge over u s companies but many economists say that the u s dollar s strength is a reflection of the fact that the economy is in a good place and they point out that trump is deviating from the precedent set by prior presidents to verbally support a strong dollar advertisement all eyes are on u s china trade negotiations trump said that on dec 15 he would impose tariffs on even more chinese imports including cellphones laptops bike helmets and other popular products trump has long railed against china for purposefully devaluing its currency and even promised to label china a currency manipulator as soon as he took office something he eventually did in august 2019 ross went out of his way on fox business to say china appeared to be doing better now still the threat is hanging out there that other nations could be next economically speaking going from a quota on brazilian steel to a tariff doesn t change much the united states will get a bit more revenue from the tariffs but u s companies will probably have to eat that extra cost instead there s a lot of confusion about why trump is hitting brazil and argentina for devaluing their currencies argentina s economy has been in trouble for years and a new center left president was just elected another shake up that has worried investors brazil s economy has also been teetering on the edge of recession this year as these countries have struggled their currencies have naturally fallen in value especially against the u s dollar since the u s economy remains healthy advertisement currency wars not really tweeted nelson barbosa a former brazilian finance minister despite de careless statements of our brazilian finance minister the recent fluctuation in the brl usd exchange rate is market driven and the usual exchange rate volatility in latin america should not be an excuse for protectionism by the us monday wasn t the first time trump has hit a nation with higher tariffs over currency chad bown a fellow at the peterson institute for international economics pointed out that trump increased tariffs on turkey in august 2018 because the turkish lira was sliding against the dollar but what s different now is the scale brazil is the ninth biggest economy in the world turkey is 19th similarly brazil is the 13th largest u s trading partner in goods according to the office of the u s trade representative turkey is 32nd no one knows where any of this is going but that s the point it s another dose of uncertainty and a reminder that trump is ready for a currency war on top of a trade war

over the past year mark zuckerberg has held a series of interviews themed around technology and society this conversation with tyler and patrick is the last in that series and covers why they think the study of progress is so important including how it could affect biomedical research the founding of new universities and foundations building things fast housing and healthcare affordability the next four years of the chan zuckerberg initiative and more watch the full conversation recorded november 22nd 2019 read the full transcript note this transcript has been lightly edited for clarity if you see an issue please email the team mark zuckerberg hey everyone and welcome to the next in our series of discussions on the internet and technology and progress and some of the social issues that we face we ve done a number of these this year focused on topics ranging from regulation to journalism to biomedical research and today what we re gonna focus on a discussion on what progress is how we might study it what academic work is already going on in the space and what we might think about to look at examples from the past to determine how we can make more progress for humanity going forward today joining me is tyler cowen who studies economics at george mason university and is also the coauthor of the popular blog marginal revolution and patrick collison who s the cofounder and ceo of stripe which is a pretty amazing company that basically does payments and economic infrastructure for the internet so we ve been talking about these topics for a while now i mean this is something that you guys have both studied in a lot of depth and you recently wrote an op ed together in the atlantic about how we might have a new or different approach for studying the nature of progress and in order to mine historical examples to figure out how we can make more progress in the future i think it d be interesting just to start off by hearing how you re thinking about it and the basic summary and what feedback you ve gotten on the piece that you wrote patrick collison sure so i think one of the most important facts in the world and sort of the history of civilization today is that the rate of progress has not been constant right if you look at sort of what happened in the world say between 0 and 1700 1800 thereabouts at the rate of progress by any major metric in terms of you know average income or average life expectancy or infant mortality any of these measures it was either constant or only improving at a very slow rate right and then something happened something changed around sort of 1700 1750 you know the industrial revolution the enlightenment the advent of something approximating modern science and once that happened so many things started to get better together incomes improved life expectancies increased we started to discover really fundamental knowledge about the world we started to invent really important new technologies and these things over the last couple of centuries really diffused around the world right so that s interesting and important and the thing that has been a focus of both of ours for the past couple years is thinking about well we sort of transitioned from this regime where we weren t making much progress to one where we had been making much more is this the best we can do right or is there something that looks compared to status quo today you know so much better again that it s sort of like a status quo before the industrial revolution and as you look around the world today on the one hand we see the tremendous importance of the progress that we are generating and that for example the number of people in extreme poverty has declined by more than a billion people since i was born but on the other hand there s a lot of suggestive evidence that maybe we aren t as effective at generating progress today as we have been in the past so for example if you look at the u s productivity growth mid century or say between you know 1920 1970 was maybe about 1 9 a year now most economists think it s much lower maybe around sort of 4 a year something like that so we re at least by economic measures generating progress more slowly than we used to be now whatever the rate at which we re kind of making progress or figuring out ways to do things better today whatever that absolute level is it would be much better if we were doing it more effectively if we were able to solve the most important problems that face us today in 50 years and 100 years rather than 500 years or a thousand years right so the meta question we re really interested in is how does progress happen how do we discover useful knowledge how is that diffused and how can we do it better tyler cowen it s important to understand i think how much this is an invisible crisis so if you have a growth rate that is 1 percentage point lower over the course of a bit more than a century you could have been three times richer with a higher growth rate that would be something like the difference between the united states today and mexico so by having a lower rate of productivity growth in no given year does it feel that bad but two three generations later you re much worse off it s harder to pay off your debts harder to solve climate change harder to address a whole host of problems zuckerberg yeah so before we kinda dive into how we can improve this what do you say to the people who question whether all this progress is positive i mean certainly as we make progress in one area it creates issues in other areas and that s been a big topic that i focused on in my work at facebook over the last few years and a lot of these challenge discussions but how does that fit into the overall framework of what you re studying and this discipline here cowen i don t think economic growth is always a positive but the world and america has serious problems i would rather address those problems with more resources rather than fewer whether it is paying off our debts addressing climate change fixing global poverty and knowledge matters too so there s a recent paper by ester duflo and abhijit banerjee and they find if you give foreign aid combined with coaching the rate of return to that intervention is maybe 100 to 400 and that may or may not be true but what i would like to see is a world where everyone is obsessing over that claim over that debate working very hard to figure out that it s true that should be on the front page people should be talking about it calling up their siblings my goodness i just read this what are we gonna do do you agree or not collison yeah and look while again i think it s unequivocally the case that sort of certain kinds of progress in certain places to a certain extent can have harms and externalities and all the rest and a really important part of progress is figuring out how do we mitigate those how do we solve them and so on i think climate change is probably kind of the foremost global example today but i think it s really important or it is easy for us sitting here in the bay area in california to undervalue the prosperity and the kind of wealth we ve been able to generate over the past couple hundred years since i was born for example global life expectancy has increased by about six years and infant mortality has fallen by more than 50 again i mentioned the statistic of the number of people who have left extreme poverty this is incredibly important right and so i think there s we re not the first people to say it but there is a moral imperative to this kind of progress and we shouldn t lose sight of that fact zuckerberg yeah i agree i just think it s important to acknowledge that a lot of these things are not uniform and you know from running a company that when you look at averages it hides a lot of issues your example on the rates of poverty going down i think is an interesting one in this because what a lot of people don t particularly wanna talk about these days is that most of the benefit of people coming out of poverty has happened in china and in some places in the world poverty has actually increased so i generally agree with the premise and i think studying this stuff will generally help us to make more progress in those places i mean that may be a good example because perhaps looking at some of the examples of what has done well in china could be applied to other places where there have been issues but before we dive into the discussion on this i just wanted to make sure that we didn t cover this is a way that comes across as if every step forward comes without a cost and i m sure as we talk through the different examples i mean that ll come up as well collison yeah and we should emphasize that you know when we sort of talk about the phenomenon of progress you know i think gdp or gdp per capita is a pretty good first approximation measure of it and it correlates strongly with many of the things we care about but they re definitely not the same thing i think an important question for anybody interested in this area to think about is well how should we define progress and what are the better and worse kinds of it again in gdp we have a relatively effective metric we can use across countries but there already is interesting work on what might better measures be and i think that s really important to study cowen well let s say you want to improve the lot of people in west virginia one growth enhancing way of doing that is to make it easier to build say in washington d c and the bay area right now to move from west virginia say to menlo park it s extraordinarily expensive you can t just pick up and show up here and hope to get a job washing dishes the way one might have done in america 50 years ago so by having more building more economic growth also more gdp it would increase more opportunity so economic growth and opportunity they do tend to be correlated and sometimes the problem is we don t have enough growth not that we have too much collison and look not to hammer this point too strongly but you know you did invite the two people who wrote the piece for our progress here zuckerberg yeah and i wanna spend most of the time actually talking about that i just wanted to make sure that we hit that up front so there are a lot of people who already are studying this in different ways right they re historians economists when you re thinking about what the field is when you re talking about trying to create a new science of studying progress what more do you think needs to get done or what do you envision on that i mean i know you have a fund that you ve put together emergent ventures and where you re basically finding academics who are studying examples of where there s progress in the past to start this field but what does this add up to what form does this take over time cowen one view of mine is that not enough philanthropy is long term oriented in this regard i ve been influenced by your chan zuckerberg initiative and also in philanthropy there are too many choke points that can say no so foundations become their own bureaucracies they become very risk averse so emergent ventures is a new kind of philanthropy there s one layer of yes or no people are encouraged to apply if the payoff is 30 40 years down the road the attitude is great take a lot of chances worry about getting some winners and some risk and not expect the median project to be something that necessarily looks good when taken to a board so that s one way that thinking in terms of progress helps us restructure at the micro level the particular decisions we re making zuckerberg yeah collison i strongly agree that sort of there s a lot of important work already happening across multiple disciplines that is relevant to these questions like the idea of there being a new science of progress that was the headline placed on the article but not exactly what we re saying what we re arguing is that the work that s already happening should be receiving more attention and there should be much more of us and just to give a couple of quick examples there s strongly suggested evidence that we can teach management practices so people can run firms more effectively right so there s a couple of studies on this there s a good one from some folks at stanford that did a randomized trial in india and there s a really neat one that came out last year from michela giorcelli looking at firms in italy and showing that over 15 years after a management training program with some natural randomization that those firms were employing more people paying more wages being more successful and another randomized trial in mexico conducted over the past couple years again 600 firms ensuring that just teaching better management practices actually makes those companies much better off if that s true that s amazing low hanging fruit right we should be investing much more in this area we should be figuring out which kinds of management training work better or worse than others is this generalized to all countries how can we actually implement and execute this in the world more broadly so that s one second is tyler mentioned this point about geographic mobility right when you think about how do we grow gdp or how do we generate progress maybe housing policy s not the first thing we re naturally drawn to thinking about however if you look at the usa in 1980 40 of people moved somewhere else when they took a new job so those things went together much more if you look last year about one in ten people moved when they took a new job right so within the u s geographic mobility really declined that is in large part because the costs of movement have enormously increased as housing costs have increased especially in our most productive regions over the past couple decades now if you look into that sort of more closely there are economists who ve been studying these questions quite closely for the past couple of years these two guys hsieh and moretti published an updated version of a previous paper this summer putting forward a model showing that if you look at the zoning restrictions that existed in the bay area and new york between 1964 and 2009 and you imagine a counter factual world where there was much more supply elasticity in these places and we built way more homes here in the bay area and in new york in that counter factual world average u s income would be in their model 3 700 higher per person again not just for people in those places but across the country right that s a huge effect size and so again we should be studying these questions much more closely and we should be figuring out okay well if that s true what are the policy prescriptions how do we actually go act upon that it s amazing low hanging fruit and then to give a third one as those two examples show funding science is incredibly important but there s surprisingly little work about how we should be funding science and how could we do that most effectively and actually beneath the surface it s been changing a tremendous amount here in the u s over the past couple of decades and whether that s a good thing is an important policy question so for example in 1980 the nih spent 12x more dollars on researchers under 40 than researchers over 50 so they predominately funded younger people today they spend 5x more dollars on people over 50 than under 40 and so it s really inverted it s kind of gone from primarily funding these young investigators to this gerontocracy where they re funding older scientists maybe that s good maybe that s bad i don t know but that seems like a very important question to answer and so part of our point in arguing for progress studies is when you really look at kind of the expansive version of all the different things that can sort of you know influence our ability to discover new useful knowledge to generate economic growth the set of questions is super broad and we should be trying to kind of synthesize this effectively on medical research zuckerberg yeah so let s go deep on medical research here for a second because this is an area that you wrote this paper about before about how the progress in the field might be slowing and like you mentioned the chan zuckerberg initiative the philanthropy that i run with my wife a big focus of it is on medical research and trying to we have this aspirational goal that we wanna help build tools that can help scientists cure prevent or manage all diseases by the end of this century and basically the math of how you get there is starting about 100 years ago there was really this uptick in medical research where we started doing randomized control experiments treating it more like an experimental science since around that time the average life expectancy has increased by a quarter of a year every year relatively linearly there s no guarantee of course that that continues but if we re able to have that continue then that would imply that by the end of the century we will generally have had to have either cured prevented or been able to manage most if not all of the diseases that we re aware of now so there s some trend that suggests that this should be reasonable and the approach that we re taking in the work at czi is largely about building tools to help compound the rate of science and what we see is that like you mentioned the government is the largest and most important funder of science and it basically funds the whole establishment of scientists across the country but the grants tend to be very spread out across a lot of people they re not typically put into big infrastructure projects and that s the niche that we felt through czi that we can help to fill instead of investing a million dollars in a lab put 100 million or a couple hundred million dollars over time into building up really important scientific assets for the community like helping to fund scientists to go put together this human cell atlas think about it as like the periodic table of elements but for biology all the different kinds of cells in the human body and the goal is just if you look throughout the history of science at least most major scientific breakthroughs have been preceded by the invention of new tools that help people look at things in different ways and so the theory is similar to what you re going at of how you increase the compounding rate of progress there are a couple of different directions that i think we could go in here one is that i m curious what you ve seen in your studies in the space that suggest to you that the rate of progress is actually slowing and i m also curious about the examples you ve seen overall of how the science around studying progress would potentially lead to a different approach or a different portfolio of how this kind of work gets done so i don t know where you want to start with that but there s a lot here to do cowen here s what worries me and it should worry you too so as you mentioned u s life expectancy is basically going up in linear fashion but if you look at expenditures we used to spend a few percentage points of gdp on healthcare and now it s about 18 so we ve gone up to 18 and we re not even boosting the rate i m not saying it s the fault of any one group of people but something has gone wrong there s some kind of last mile problem you can turn to the newspapers and read all kinds of fantastic stories new research new ideas new tools but when the rubber hits the road people living longer we re spending more and more and more for exactly the same returns so if that trend continues and you see a similar trend in many areas crop yields feeding the world other areas the question becomes where does all the progress go so the idea that you need to look at each structure and encourage more risk taking better decisions with the money less bureaucratization maybe in some cases more centralization whatever it takes but that there is this invisible crisis and people are distracted by the headlines about crispr or whatever but actually what you get for the money performance is so so i think collison yeah and so what we wrote in this article a year ago about what s going on in science if you look at it by the most kind of microscopic measures like the number of phds in the u s actually if you take all the microscopic measures they all have grown by about a factor between 50 and 100 number of phds number of papers published every year actual dollars into the science funding and so on so in a very stylized way if you look at the first half of the twentieth century as compared to the second half there s way more input in the second half of the century and again not by 50 but by orders of magnitude and so then i think the question for all of us would be well in which half of the century did we get more out in terms of useful scientific knowledge and then whichever we think did better to what degree and again this is a very difficult question to answer of how do you weigh scientific knowledge and so you have to look at it i think into various applied contexts like life expectancy or semiconductors or as tyler mentioned crop yields or whatever and i think what s interesting and anyway should be concerning is that for almost every conceivable applied measure we seem to be getting at best constant returns but that s really bad because we see exponentially increasing inputs and constant return outputs that is almost by definition not a process that we can sustain now there s two broad possibilities there one is it s just getting intrinsically harder to generate progress and to discover these things and who knows maybe some significant part of that is true but the other possibility is it s somehow more institutional right it s more contingent it s more sociological and again we do have suggestive evidence that our institutions are well they re certainly older than they used to be and as in the nih funding example there are changes happening beneath the surface and so on that may or may not be good so i don t think we should write off the possibility that it s not inevitable and that there do exist alternate forms of organization where things would work better and again if we dig a little bit into the evidence there you see things like there s a science funding program that obviously you re familiar with called hhmi at the howard hughes medical institute they give grants along the lines of how cci does where they re longer term they re more open ended and so on pierre azoulay at mit wrote a paper a couple years ago in trying to look at well if you take ostensibly identical scientists some of whom receive hhmi grants and some of whom don t how much more successful are the hhmi recipients and he concluded they re about twice as likely to produce a top 1 paper by citation count again that s really suggestive zuckerberg top 1 if they do what collison they re about twice as likely to produce a top 1 paper by citation count zuckerberg if they collison oh say if they receive an hhmi grant zuckerberg well that might be correlation not causation collison yeah so he tries zuckerberg they do get a lot of the best people collison yeah yeah yeah so he tries to control for that and use a reasonable methodology for it but some of it could totally be that just a selection effect but again i think it s very suggestive that maybe there are things we could do that would better enable this discovery and this might seem like a bit of a red herring but i think it is suggestive that in many other domains where we can objectively assess progress it s very clear that our productivity has fallen off a cliff and for reasons that we can be pretty sure are not that it s getting intrinsically harder and so for example when new york decided to build the subway in 1900 4 7 years later they opened 23 subway stations and in 2019 dollars they spent just over a billion dollars doing so so 23 stations just over a billion dollars when new york decided to build the second avenue subway in the year 2000 17 years later they opened three stations and they spent 4 5 billion doing so and so our productivity in subway construction has at least in new york decreased by a factor of 40 here in the bay area we decide to build the golden gate bridge and the bay bridge starting in 1933 both projects finished within four years and to celebrate it we decide to build man made island and we built that island in 18 months and i haven t tried but i would wager that if one tried to build a new island in san francisco it would be difficult to do so today in 18 months when france decided to build the tgv its high speed rail it opened the first line after five years california started pursuing high speed rail 11 years ago we forecast being finished in 2033 so we project a 25 year project but of course that s a projection it ll probably end up being much longer still so this is the domain where it s hard to imagine that building infrastructure had gotten intrinsically harder right the atoms aren t physically heavier than they used to be right and so clearly there s something institutional sociological going on with infrastructure larry summers talks about the idea of the promiscuous distribution of the veto power and how much harder it is to get things done inasmuch as that s true then there s the question of well have other institutions other progress generating mechanisms in our society have they also got less efficient and if so what can we do about it zuckerberg so as an aside if you re watching this patrick collects these examples of of historical projects that went fast and that you can t imagine how they went that fast so if you google his website he has like a whole list of these that i think is pretty interesting and compelling when you go through all of them collison yeah i think it s just important to understand how effectively we as a species can do things when we re organized the right way humanity is pretty amazing and when possibilities are unlocked when efficacy is enabled we can do great things cowen sometimes it is a matter of actual will so for the last 40 years getting around for almost all americans it is slower and before that we had a period from 1800 say to 1970 when it got quicker and quicker and quicker and now even flying in airplanes for most people is slower traffic is worse those are solvable problems manhattan should have congestion pricing and a stiffer form of it than they re likely to opt for so the notion that people have lost the ability to imagine a future much different and much better than what they know to me is one of the most worrying aspects of where we are now collison yeah and quantitatively i mean if you look at the percentage of americans who think that their kids lives will be better than theirs that has been in monotonic decline not strictly monotonic but generally declining since world war ii until on an empirical basis americans are getting less hopeful about their futures their kids futures and that s a really bad thing because it can be an auto catalyzing process and a self fulfilling prophecy cowen and we re supposed to be the most optimistic forward looking country the data on france how many people think their kids will be worse off that s much more worrying yet and there may be a self fulfilling prophecy to this if you think the future won t be so great you ll invest less you won t work as hard you ll contract your risk taking and you end up with a social and economic malaise and indeed you see falling rates of economic growth in most of the western world zuckerberg so i m curious how you would think about going about and studying these organizational changes going back to biomedical science for example just because this is an area we do a lot of work in the woman who runs czi science initiative cori bargmann she s a very renowned scientist and she has this theory that a lot of the granting process that nih does but also hhmi it basically encourages very individualistic work right you give people grants they work on their own you re not incentivizing people to work together people actually want to work together they want to coordinate and when i was talking about the human cell atlas a lot of the issue there that needed to get dealt with was that a lot of people were working on cell atlases for different parts of the body the liver cell atlas whatever but they were all in different data types and formats so that way you couldn t compile a holistic thing so a lot of what she did and the work of czi was basically helping to coordinate that way when these grants were given everything like the teams worked together the data types were similar so that way it all added up to a bigger thing and that certainly seems like one of many theories that one could have for how you could organize this stuff better but there s this question of how much of progress whether that s something that one could have determined just through historical data versus this is the type of thing you need people or the government or foundations to go out and just run different experiments and see how this works and i m curious how you think about in terms of studying this how much this is like this history and history of science based on data that s already out there versus we should just try different models of things and encourage more creativity and more competition and try different things cowen it s striking to me if you look at american universities the list of the top places in 1920 and the list today it s completely the same except we ve added on california otherwise no change top 50 universities if you look at zuckerberg it s very different for companies cowen of course even from 1980 it s zuckerberg decade over decade the list of the top ten companies by market cap almost completely turns over cowen yes procedures for tenure in the top 50 research universities almost exactly the same whatever you think of those there s something gone wrong in the sector there s not enough experimentation with how you reward people more schools should experiment with a different tenure or reward people more on the basis of practical impact and again you might object to any particular solution but the extent to which experimentation has died at the institutional level to me is striking collison and to underscore that point if you look at the top 25 universities in the world today or the kinds of ranking there s lots of them seven of the top 25 are american universities that were started in a single 30 year period between 1861 and 1891 and if you look at where those universities come from and what were the people behind them thinking they were very deliberately and specifically reform minded cowen and progress minded collison absolutely they thought well obviously academic institutions exist harvard yale and so on were already around but they saw the success of german research university model they saw the possibilities of the u s and they saw at least what they thought was required for the future and they very deliberately decided we will try something different and again that yielded now seven of the top 25 universities today so i think it strongly empirically underscores the value of the experimentation you re talking about and i fully agree i think we should be historically informed but ultimately a certain amount of commitment decision and just willingness to experiment is going to be required the other thing i think your point with so the teams gets at is there are these really thought provoking examples of just like productive cultures through history look at vienna 1880 to 1940 or something in so many different fields you have people who do this incredibly informative work klimt and you had mahler and you had mach in physics and you had of course austrian economics and von mises and hayek and all the rest and you had freud and you had wittgenstein vienna was amazing in this period and when you dig into the specific stories you realize a lot of these people knew each other and they were inspired by each other they give credit to each other for again across multiple disciplines different parts of their thinking or if you look at edinburgh during the scottish enlightenment again a tiny place edinburgh in 1780 was like the size of santa cruz right and yet you get modern economics from smith you have hume you have the birth of modern geology amazing literature poetry and so on and so clearly there was something excellent in edinburgh in 1780 that was not there in dublin in 1780 and i think obviously it s hard to pin down what was that thing but at the same time the difficulty in defining it doesn t mean it wasn t there or it s not important cowen i would say this i m sitting here with two university dropouts that s notable to me the bay area is our modern vienna bravo to the bay area but we re not working nearly hard enough to build other new viennas and other places and i don t really think it s quite manhattan anymore it s a wonderful city and amazing place to go but it is not a world leader for ideas in the way in it was say in the 1920s through the 1980s zuckerberg people study this right i mean so what would have been the main things that people have learned so far from studying vienna or edinburgh collison well i don t think there s a rich literature of lessons from those places obviously lots has been written about them there are great historical accounts i ve enjoyed reading them but it s an intrinsically very difficult thing to do to figure out which things causally mattered and these things there s a certain degree to which they might be over determined and so i think it s very hard you don t have counterfactuals obviously you can t run trials and so i think it is a very difficult question to answer and i think for understandable reasons people studying these questions are reluctant to take definitive stances that this is what mattered in 1900 vienna cowen but one lesson i would say the scottish islands people moved to edinburgh right vienna you have jews coming in from the pale of settlement the bay area people coming from all over the world and indeed you are from ireland so immigration immigration is not a guarantee of things going well but the bringing together of different ideas and cultures and the new clash of opposing perspectives has been correlated with a lot of these viennas in the world history collison very true although i m pretty sure that in the 1900s paris had more foreigners than vienna i think it was like 2 in vienna so cowen if you go from the scottish islands to edinburgh in 1740 that s a huge difference it s a bigger difference than maybe mexico to los angeles today zuckerberg so if you re thinking about what work to fund in terms of studying historical progress what s your framework for figuring out where to even begin studying because i mean what you re talking about here is basically studying the economic and scientific result of immigration which is obviously a massively socially important debate that s at the center of a lot of political debates and has been for a long time so from one perspective it s surprising that it wouldn t have been studied in more detail to understand the impact of it but that s very different from the biomedical science type stuff that we were talking about a second ago do you have a framework in your head for how would think about or prioritize study in different areas or is it mostly just about finding really sharp people who have new ideas and funding them to do different kinds or work how do you think about that overall cowen people who are curious people who have bold ambitions people who have what i call stamina they just don t even stop people who are working in productive small groups that maybe through whatsapp in fact or it could be their next door neighbors their colleagues at a university when those say four items come together then i think you have possibly what is a very good funding decision and i would take a lot of chances on those people not worry too much about the micromanaging and let talent rip and let groups form and see what happens zuckerberg got it so it s very much like entrepreneurship in that way you re betting on the person more than the idea cowen but also the vision right there has to be a vision and there are plenty of successful entrepreneurs who are not curious so for intellectual progress to really put curiosity very highly is part of my philosophy collison on the one hand not only do we acknowledge that an immense amount of very important insightful work has already been created and it s that work that has to a large degree inspired both of our viewpoints for example the paper tyler mentioned about declining research productivity in semiconductors crop yields and a couple of other fields that was done fairly close to here and that is work squarely relevant to these questions that i think is really important and we may not be here in the same way without it on the other hand it is simultaneously true that major swathes of these questions really are surprisingly under investigated and so again to return to biomedical funding and the nih as far as i can tell there are no books assessing how well the nih is working and i don t have a strong view on the answer to that question but i do have a strong view on the importance of knowing which parts of the nih are working better and worse and inasmuch as the nih has changed over the last couple of decades was the old nih better or the new one like this stuff is so important and so while it s the case that there s a huge amount of good research happening today with fantastic researchers in a sense there aren t enough of them and a lot of the central questions are still unanswered zuckerberg yeah interesting so you were talking a minute ago about the explosion in costs in healthcare and right now i think one of the defining aspects of the moment that we re in is a lot of the basic costs of living for a lot of people have just increased a lot the story that we tell about our society is that you have technology and you have competition and it drives down prices so if you bought a ten year old tv today it would cost 5 of what it cost ten years ago so clearly the value and efficiency has increased a lot there but then in things that matter so much like healthcare education rent those things have generally just increased right and the normal dynamics that you d be hoping would play out aren t and to some degree for the quality of life for a lot of people the increases in those costs may even be dwarfing all the other advances in everything else cowen sure absolutely zuckerberg so do you think that those things are all related i think you used the phrase cost disease when referring to the cost explosion of things like healthcare and education student debt and rent do you think that s a different type of problem or do you think that is fundamentally related to the rate of progress in biomedicine as an example cowen i think there are common features to these problems though each one is different restrictions on entry is one highly bureaucratized institutions sometimes a lot of third party payment which may be required in the case of catastrophic healthcare but it nonetheless has distorting effects areas where people have very strong moral feelings i think we often make worse decisions about we re not analytical enough and you put all of those together but i would stress say healthcare if you go to singapore healthcare there i think it s about 4 of gdp they have slightly higher life expectancy than we do their system is by no means perfect but we can see though comparative analysis there are ways of doing this better the nimby problem cost of living getting an apartment in japan it is mostly solved because building in japan tends to be regulated at higher levels than the city or the county so more gets built living in japan is cheaper the cost of renting an apartment so often we know the answers we shy away from really focusing on a concerted effort to get to doing them in this country collison yeah and agree with all of that and i would just underscore the entry costs aspect and the entry costs aren t always they take different forms right and empirically the entry costs of forming a new university are really high but that s not because there s a kind of formal toll you have to pay it s not like zoning where there are deliberate specific legal restrictions that prohibit you from doing so but just as a practical matter sociologically institutionally accreditation dynamics who knows it s apparently almost impossibly difficult to create a successful new university today and so i think answering the cost disease question is one of the most important set of subcomponents in this broader question of what is it that enables our progress and at an overarching level it s just surprising to me that we don t have more definitive and clear answers there alex tabarrok a colleague of tyler cowen wrote a long paper on cost disease collison exactly last summer and there are other papers also analyzing the question but it s a surprisingly sparse literature alex s list of citations was not that long and he had some suggestions as to what the underlying etiology might be maybe he s right maybe he s wrong but again to your point it s one of the most pressing questions for american society for global society in 2019 we really have to know what s happening and to return to something tyler said earlier part of our hope it s not to promote any specific solution any specific aspect of it but rather that even though this is not what s focally central in the headlines today it should be as we think about what the world is gonna look like in 50 years or 100 years it plausibly more than anything else is going to determine the shape of that cowen as an entrepreneur what is it you find most striking about america s dysfunctional economic sectors because you intersect with them all the time right zuckerberg yeah i mean i would want to see this get studied more there are just so many different factors and i think part of it what is a little bit confusing is that the things that are making healthcare so expensive they may have some fundamental link to the things that make college tuition so expensive but on its surface it seems like there are also more proximate causes that are quite different so with college tuition the fact that it s really expensive so then we do more to subsidize the cost of it and then by doing so we re not providing any pressure on colleges to make it more efficient and then the cost just goes up further is a pretty different dynamic than what s going on with healthcare where basically americans want to know that if someone in their family gets sick they re going to be able to get every treatment possible which ends up i m sure you ve seen all the stats on this that half of the healthcare costs someone incurs is during the last six months of their life and that s i guess part of what you re saying is an american moral value which is that we believe that you should do everything you can to help someone who s sick whereas in a lot of other countries i don t know what singapore s situation is but a lot of the ones that are often cited as more efficient healthcare systems don t have that approach they say okay if someone in your family has this form of cancer we ll do these two treatments and then we re done and part of that is because they may not be able to incur the level of debt as a country that the u s can so they may just have to make that tradeoff but it creates all these downstream dynamics where now if you as a society are willing to say we re going have two treatments for this cancer and not try all seven things then now france can go for example negotiate with the drug companies and say all right i m only going support the two that are the most cost effective and the other ones are out to dry whereas in the american system you don t have that negotiating leverage so it seems like they re very different things but intuitively it seems like at their root there should be some commonalities and i would be very interested to understand that in more detail i m curious why from what you re saying about that the literature is sparse collison on cost disease in particular zuckerberg yeah why do you think more people aren t studying this i mean given that this is just such a central thing in the lives of most people right i mean the cost of living in the city has gone up so much we have a whole generation of students i think the total student debt is now almost 2 trillion right i think it was 1 7 trillion the last stat that i saw and of course healthcare is the number of people in the country who are one issue away from being bankrupt is just staggering so what s preventing people from studying this collison tyler s the economist cowen in academia i wouldn t say anything s preventing them the incentive is to build a brick and to build a brick that can survive scrutiny by referees the incentive is not to build a building in most cases biomedicine actually is often different but in the social sciences there s so many bricks out there and so people want to say oh we re already studying this it s correct the bricks are there in the millions but the bricks and the buildings are a different thing but i have a question for you if i may be allowed zuckerberg go for it cowen what is it you would most like to see from academics and i don t mean research on social media i mean america the world what do you want zuckerberg although i would like more research on social media cowen absolutely that s fine zuckerberg no look i think these issues on exploding costs and why the systems aren t working the way that they re supposed to for people is probably one of the most pressing questions and when i think about our work over the next decade it s like what are we going do that s will fundamentally make people s lives better there s a lot that we can do but if these problems continue at the rate that they re going at it s actually quite hard for me to imagine how we could do enough good to overcome the increase in costs that people are incurring at things that are so fundamental so we re working on them in somewhat different ways but i think healthcare is difficult because it is so inherently political because it touches on moral values if you wanna have a difference in approach of how we treat the last six months of people s lives that s something that s more of a democratic question than a technocratic one i think people need to be able to support that so i don t personally feel like that s an area that i m gonna have a huge impact a lot of people are focused on that but the area that i do think we can make a big impact is on long term science research so if you can just make it more efficient to cure prevent or manage diseases then that over the long term should really be the answer for bringing healthcare costs in line not in the next ten years but maybe in over the next 50 years i d like to see a solution before that so i d love to see more studying of the healthcare part of this but on the science side i m quite optimistic about that on housing i don t know there s always the question of which forces in technology which trends end up being stronger so on the one hand you have this giant mismatch of opportunity where people feel compelled to move to cities because that s where a lot of the jobs are but then there s not enough building of supply of housing so rent just increases and then that means that even though people are going and doing higher value things their lives actually aren t benefiting as much from that because so much of their costs are just of the value that they re generating is just going to housing because rent is getting so high so historically what have people done we invented cars and freeways that way people could live further out maybe something like the hyperloop could extend suburbs like five times as far so that could make it so someone could live quite further away and that would be good right if you can increase the effective radius of a city that s one way to alleviate constraints political constraints or concerns about people building things so that way you can get more supply bring the cost down i happen to think a different thing is probably the right solution in 2019 it s a lot easier to move bits around than it is atoms so rather than people inventing a new hyperloop or cars i tend to think the set of technologies whether it s augmented reality or virtual reality or video presence that just lets people be where they wanna be physically and feel present with other people wherever they need to be to do their job to connect with the people they care about that feels to me the better long term solution don t make everyone move to cities make it so people can choose where they wanna be and can get access to all the opportunities they want it s hard for me to imagine more important problems over the next decade i think over the longer term potentially climate change is more of an existential issue but in terms of people s lives today i think the exploding costs from these areas is such a profound issue and the trend is so out of control collison three three quick points on that one is i think these questions are often a little bit like the cost of disease question i think one of the reasons it s difficult to study is because you have to take this very macroscopic and potentially this very microscopic view and so say for example in science if it were the case that the administrative burden on scientists had increased by say two thirds over the last 40 years i m not saying it has and not saying that even if it has that is in fact the cause of any kind of slowdown but if it had that might be quite difficult to observe because it can come in the form of well it takes twice as long on average for things to be approved and the forms are longer and you re interrupted more and so actually specifically diagnosing that causal pathways can really be quite tricky and i think that generalizes a lot of the fields secondly to your point about technology solving the agglomeration imperative of cities i think that could be true although you know here we are in person cowen others are watching zuckerberg yeah the people are watching wherever else collison very fair but even if technology solved that i guess my worry would be that the socio institutional dynamics that have ruined cities or made them less effective or whatever probably also generalized and applied to other domains and so we re going to suffer the costs of those same phenomena elsewhere zuckerberg oh yeah cowen and what do you wanna ask mark collison what have you learned from doing czi you launched it five years ago zuckerberg four years ago collison okay yeah how will the next four years be different to the first four zuckerberg well so one of the things that we struggle with here that these are such a long term projects so we talked a lot about the scientific research we re also doing a bunch of work with education to build tools for teachers to do more project based learning more personalized learning for kids but basically make it so that teachers have tools to do the work that they want to do like mentoring students and not just having to lecture and have everyone learn at the same pace we re making progress in all of these areas and i think one of the meta questions in running czi is at what point to check in and consider evolving the direction i mean obviously there s minor execution things that you try to improve along the way but i want to make sure that we have an awareness that fundamentally these are problems that we re gonna be working on for 10 or 20 years and not i think a lot of these things just a consistency of approach and building trust is more important than constantly evaluating or potentially thrashing in science we ve had the benefit of taking on a number of different projects so the human cell atlas was one of the original ones now one of the next areas that we re really excited to work on is imaging there s a lot of advances in microscopy but there are a lot of things that we still can t see and as engineers i think one of the things that you can probably appreciate is when you re trying to debug a system you really want to get into the code and step through it to see where the thing is breaking down but we don t really have a way today to see a white blood cell eat a a virus right like in vivo right in the body to see proteins folding live and i think that there are certain optical thresholds on the physics that you might not be able to get beyond but between that and the advances in ai i do think that it s possible to give scientists new imaging capacity that hasn t been possible before so a lot of what we re trying to do is so with the human cell atlas we took an approach that was very broad and collaborative and somewhat chaotic even in a way and i think we were able to learn some of the lessons from that as we re now thinking about how we organize the imaging project about okay maybe it would be helpful to have more clearly established leadership around it up front maybe there are things that rather than having just one big project there re gonna be areas where we can just build tools that go into every lab there s one software package called that a lot of scientists right now the actual technology of microscopes is ahead of scientists ability to process the data there s this weird mismatch because and it makes sense because the nih funding supports people to basically have a lab collison yeah tool building is not really subsidized or supported that well zuckerberg yeah if you want to have a team of ongoing software engineers you re going to want an effort that s going on for a while and that s more than a couple of people so kind of thing i think there s a real niche that no one is doing that stuff at the scale it needs to get done so just pushing on both of things collison yeah and there s uniform agreement on that particular point with every biomedical scientist that i speak with tool building is under supported zuckerberg yeah so i don t know from a meta point i m a little wary of concluding which things have worked and not worked well yet i mean certainly not everything we re gonna do is gonna work collison four years it s too early to say zuckerberg yeah but it s certainly interesting and what i try to push the teams to do is make sure that the work that we re doing are things that clearly would not have happened otherwise where i think especially in a lot of these fields in philanthropy i think there are a lot of potential issues where it s easy to give money to something and feel like you re doing good because you probably are doing some good but lack the discipline to say am i doing the most good that i can and i think we have a responsibility to do that so that s the thing i push our team to do is develop really different theories i m quite confident that in education the work that we re doing is just stuff that if we weren t trying it it s not clear that anyone else would be doing an effort like this at scale i feel really good about that i think in imaging something like that is going to be similar even in social advocacy we re doing a lot of work in criminal justice reform that s a combination of advocacy and building tools for accountability and working with reform minded prosecutors that they can be more data driven about who they try to bring charges against because they want to be fair or at least a lot of folks want to be fair and they don t have the data to either optimize how they run their office or to hold the people in there accountable so building those kinds of tools can be super helpful and i m quite confident that if we weren t pushing on that that s a good theory to at least try to push on so that s what we try to do in the work cowen so like the criminal justice work education biomedical what s the underlying view or insider experience of yours that s the common element behind those areas like how do we boil down mark zuckerberg philanthropy to a smaller number of dimensions zuckerberg well first of all it s not just me i do it with my wife cowen oh sorry my apologies yes zuckerberg she s an important element to this because she is a teacher she s building a school i mean she spends a lot of time over there she is a doctor so if you re looking at the education in health aspects the domain expertise is more hers than mine and she is quite compelling and insightful on some of the things that need to get done there in terms of the approach that may be more inspired by me in some ways where it s the very long term focus which i think it comes from a lot of the lessons i ve learned from facebook it s the tool building which comes from having the experience building engineering teams and it s some of what we ve learned just in managing and partnering with folks through building the company is that it s a lot of what you said it s like you want to bet on the best individuals in different spaces and give them room to run in managing complex projects you need to know when something needs to be a little more directive versus when you want it to just be an open thing that can make progress in a more chaotic way and that might be more art than science or at least until your field fully solves all these questions but yeah it s an interesting set of questions and certainly one animating theme certainly is as our kids grow up we want to make sure that they live better lives so these aren t things that are primarily gonna benefit us right if we were trying to benefit us we wouldn t be working on education i think the health work is very long term oriented if we were focused on our own health you d be probably be doing more disease specific work rather than fundamental science or tool building for fundamental science which might even be a level more abstract that fundamental science to try to compound the rate of progress in science and then a lot of work on equality the criminal justice work a lot of the way that our country handles this stuff is just such an unfortunate outlier compared to other countries and the amount of human capital that is locked away is its own thing that i think deserves a lot more than just studying but certainly i think just improving that would be a big advance this conversation is interesting because i think it highlights somewhat of a distinction in i guess my approach to learning or studying these things is more the try different things and experiment and then play it forward generate new data that doesn t exist and see how that goes and talking to you and seeing the work that you do and i guess this is probably intrinsic to being an academic too where more of the work is about looking at datasets that can exist and studying what is already there rather than trying to create the new datasets or approaches there are two approaches that i think complement each other but are actually quite different in terms of how you approach learning about how to do the best work going forward collison well i think there is a very important complementarity where for any of these really important questions about how should science be organized or which kinds of policies generate the most economic growth or how one should support the diffusion of innovation or whatever i don t think there exists definitive data on that question i don t think by just going deep into the literature you re going come up with clear answers that one can feel confident in going and executing it or implementing i think of the data such that it exists and the exiting findings as food for hypothesis generation for example to return to the management training that s one but i would probably not have guessed the effect sizes would be that large right and so if those studies hadn t been conducted i don t think i would have ascribed sufficient expectation value to the effort of stripe going and doing something better but now because of those studies i think perhaps there are things we could do on the margins maybe there are things that end up being quite materially valuable over time and so i think being able to marshal those potentially being able to encourage people to dig more in particular directions and then to combine that with a willingness to experiment and a willingness to frankly just be wrong and i think the synthesis of that is really powerful and again if you go back and you look at the foundations that i think have really had significant impact over the past one hundred two hundred years i think it s that kind of combination look at warren weaver who was the guy at rockefeller who funded norman borlaug right he d worked with vannevar bush at osrd during world war ii i think he was familiar with a lot of the data and just empirical realities of how different kinds of scientific and technological ventures were likely to work but he was also willing to just place a bold bet and that pursue the hypothesis that agronomy could be radically improved but there was no particularly strong basis to truly have conviction of that and so i think it s all in the combination zuckerberg yeah interesting so i m curious to push further on one question you asked me what i would want to be studying why don t you think people are studying the cost questions as much as it seems like they should be if these are as big a questions for society and it certainly seems like they re issues that most people have what are the structural barriers that are preventing the top people in these fields from deciding to go study it is it that the fields don t line up with it is it that there s not funding for it is it too hard in certain ways like what are the dynamics that are going on here cowen there are many big questions it s hard to study them so at the end you have quite a speculative answer or set of hypothesis so the world as a whole isn t sure what to make of that is it a real contribution so the private return to you as a researcher maybe is unclear so you tend to get very famous people who are quite well established looking at really big ideas maybe a bit later in their career and i m not saying that s bad work but it s not necessarily cutting edge either and they spent their whole lives being famous and they re not necessarily in a position to actually make the breakthrough and then younger people their incentive is to first get established and do something that is quite defensible so i think in general big questions are under studied the tenure system i think increasingly is broken a lot of academics do work pretty hard but that so much of your audience is a narrowly defined set of peers who write you reference and tenure letters i think we need to change and the incentive for academics to integrate with practitioners and learn from them and actually try doing things we need more of that i ve often suggested for graduate school instead of taking a class everyone should be sent to a not so high income village for two weeks they can do whatever they want just go for two weeks think about things no one wants to do this no one wants to experiment with it people who do development often do it on their own but the notion that every economist should have studied the east asian economic miracle the industrial revolution and spent two weeks or more in a poor village it s just not how things are and i d like to change that zuckerberg so how does one go about changing that so if you re trying to create a network of people who feel like they have an incentive to study this because it s gonna be good for their career and they have a network of supportive people who might be reviewing the grants or the work that they re doing and also think that this is important work to be done how do you go about establishing that cowen i can selfishly say that at george mason virtually all of our students have very directly studied these questions and we funded a lot of them to go live other distant strange possibly poor places other departments may have more money than we do it can be done because we ve done it at george mason so i think again it s a question of the will and just the ability and desire to imagine that things could be quite different in a sense that i think was more common in the america say of 1958 or jfk s decision to put a man on the moon than you see actually in 2019 zuckerberg all right is that a good place to wrap cowen fine by me zuckerberg all right well thank you guys this has been a great conversation collison thank you cowen thank you mark patrick
the transformation of mexico is within sight president lópez obrador declared on sunday in an address in mexico city s central square to mark the first anniversary of his government in a 90 minute speech to an estimated 250 000 supporters in the zócalo lópez obrador listed his government s achievements since he took office on december 1 2018 among them laws to combat corruption the implementation of austerity measures a change to the constitution to prevent tax avoidance by large corporations cancelation of the previous government s education reform elimination of protection from prosecution for the president creation of the national guard increased welfare for the nation s most disadvantaged people a 16 increase to the minimum wage establishment of a northern border free zone and a 94 reduction in petroleum theft accompanied on stage by his wife beatriz gutiérrez müller the president claimed that his government has fulfilled 89 of the 100 commitments he made in his inaugural speech as president one year ago however the main task of the government lopez obrador stressed is to eradicate political corruption we re implementing order from the peak of power we re cleaning up the government from top to bottom like stairs are cleaned he told loyal supporters who intermittently broke into chants such as es un honor estar con obrador it s an honor to be with obrador and no estás solo you re not alone stamping out corruption and implementing austerity measures has allowed the government to fund the budget without raising taxes increasing the cost of fuel or putting the country into debt the president said lópez obrador conceded that the economy hasn t grown as the government would have liked but claimed that there is now a better distribution of wealth he emphasized that inflation is at a three year low the value of the peso has increased 4 in comparison with the us dollar the mexican stock exchange is up 2 foreign investment is strong mexico has become the united states largest trading partner and the government has struck an agreement with the private sector that will boost infrastructure spending the president expressed confidence that the new north american trade agreement will be approved by the united states and canada very soon lópez obrador highlighted that construction of the santa lucía airport and the modernization of the railway on the isthmus of tehuantepec have both begun corrupt conservatives attempted to stop the former project through legal action but couldn t he said because reason and the law were enforced lópez obrador also said that construction of the new refinery on the tabasco coast is underway as are projects to upgrade the six existing ones in addition the government has halted a 14 year decline in oil production he said international tourism and spending by foreigners while in mexico have both increased compared to last year the president said before taking the opportunity to thank the navy for its efforts to clear sargassum from the country s caribbean coastline lópez obrador said that half of all mexican households and 95 of indigenous ones are benefiting from at least one government welfare program soon it will be 100 of indigenous households he said adding his oft repeated slogan for the good of all the poor come first lópez obrador said that his government is preventing the over exploitation of water and has outlawed the use of genetically modified seeds and fracking in the second half of his speech the president railed against producers of television series that portray the drug trafficking underworld as a paradise with mansions luxury cars power good looking young men and women and designer clothes there is also another reality lópez obrador said people who consume drugs can die within a year that s sadness pain and suffering for young people for their families that s not the way to achieve happiness true happiness is being at ease with oneself being at ease with our conscience with each other he told attendees among whom were also federal lawmakers state governors and the event s guest of honor former president of uruguay josé mujica if we reduce the consumption of drugs we will be able to solve the serious problem of insecurity and violence if not it will be more complicated lópez obrador declared as on many previous occasions the president blamed the high levels of violence currently plaguing the country on the security strategies of his predecessors especially felipe calderón who launched the so called war on drugs shortly after he took office in late 2006 the country is still suffering the consequences of that mistaken policy lópez obrador said asserting that his government will not repeat such an absurd and unhinged strategy the president said his government remained committed to addressing the main causes of violence unemployment poverty marginalization ensuring that no human rights violations are committed by the armed forces and finding the 43 teaching students who disappeared in guerrero in 2014 reducing crime is the government s main challenge lópez obrador said but we are certain that we are going to pacify mexico with the support of the people and the coordinated work of the entire government he added while the transformation of mexico is within sight and a lot has been achieved in the government s first year the president said that the country is still in a process of transition and a lot more needs to be done the old has not yet finished dying and the new is still being born we re not playing around we re not pretending a new way of doing politics is underway a regime change it s not more of the same now we re being guided by honesty democracy and humanism lópez obrador said how much time will we need to consolidate the project of transformation i think one more year the foundations for the construction of a new country will be established it will be practically impossible to return to the period of shame the neoliberal period i m sure that when we complete two years of government the conservatives will no longer be able to reverse the changes mexico news daily
across the middle east protests are shaking the pillars of power in lebanon iraq and iran people have taken to the streets to express frustration with corruption mismanagement and austerity while the protest movements in each country are rooted in domestic concerns particular to that country iran as one of the main outside backers of powerful elites in both lebanon and iraq is at the foundation of each crisis the protests are a challenge to iran s legitimacy both regionally and at home and therefore constitute a severe political crisis that could have lasting strategic ramifications tehran s crisis of legitimacy will endure regardless of whether the present uprisings in lebanon iraq and iran itself are suppressed in the near term while the iranian leadership may not recognize it the protests reflect a broader rejection of the islamic republic s system of governance among parts of the iraqi lebanese and iranian populations and iran s playbook for responding to public concerns repression not concession will only exacerbate the erosion of its standing over the longer term iran has experienced its most significant turmoil in a decade a decision by the regime to reduce subsidies on gasoline sparked mass demonstration across the country earlier this month from mashhad to ahvaz iranians have taken to the streets to express their anger at the policy change which increased the price of a liter of gas by at least 50 percent for a segment of the iranian public who are already suffering under economic stress due to stifling u s imposed sanctions and decades of economic mismanagement by iran s successive governments the unexpected gas price hike was too much to take iran has witnessed episodic if not generational waves of protests the student protests of 1999 and the green wave protests in 2009 were similar in that both were fueled by reformist political hopes and triggered by regime injustice with the university of tehran as their epicenter the 1999 protests were a collective explosion of frustration by students who had seen the unelected power centers of the regime routinely block the reformist promises of president mohammad khatami similarly 10 years later hundreds of thousands of iranians took to the streets when the hardliner incumbent mahmoud ahmadinejad defeated the reformist presidential candidate mir hossein mousavi in an election marked by widespread irregularities and fraud although the protests began in condemnation of what was perceived to be a rigged election the rhetoric of the demonstrators became more radicalized as the protesters were met with the violent suppression of police forces and basij paramilitary units the slogan death to the dictator a reference to iran s supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei became one of the hallmarks of the 2009 protest movement in other words what had begun as a pro reformist movement gradually took on anti regime overtones by comparison the protests in december 2017 and january 2018 showcased anti regime sloganeering very early on these demonstrations began as hardline instigated demonstrations against the hassan rouhani government but quickly evolved into protests against the islamic republic itself this year s protests have moved the needle even further in the anti regime direction the crowds have adopted chants that include a mix of taunts against the supreme leader and even pro monarchist sentiments their slogans are punctuated by the intermittent destruction of symbols of regime authority including banks and government offices protesters have also attacked statues of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini the founder of the revolution and offices affiliated with his successor khamenei in response the iranian government blocked access to the internet across most of the country without internet access iranians lost their main tools of organization via apps like whatsapp and instagram and of communication with the outside world as access has gradually been restored to parts of the country images stories and videos of the violence used against iranian civilians have started to emerge numerous images and short videos of basiji paramilitary forces firing into crowds from sniper positions rushing into crowds while swinging truncheons from the backs of motorcycles and beating protesters indiscriminately have been posted to social media iranians are sharing stories of friends and family missing or confirmed dead early estimates already suggest over 200 iranians killed over the past week where these protesters are taking to the streets is perhaps even more important than what they re saying the regime dismissed the 1999 and 2009 protests as driven by the liberal tendencies of an urban middle class this time is different the most severe and strident anti regime activism at least in terms of destruction to government buildings appears to be occurring in more blue collar and traditionally more conservative provincial cities and towns the working class city of behbahan in the traditionally religiously conservative southern province of khuzestan witnessed some of the evocative anti regime activism the protests certainly signal that economic strain is beginning to take a toll on iran s social fabric but they are not likely the death throes of a collapsing regime the decision to change the fuel policy was abrupt but it was not impulsive the government is grappling with how to respond to an unrelenting campaign of u s economic sanctions american pressure has sent the economy into recession inflation has skyrocketed and the currency has lost 60 percent of its value against the dollar sales of iran s most important export crude oil have plummeted by 80 percent on this harsh terrain president hassan rouhani is trying to design a budget for next year that reduces expenditures and raises exports of other products that are difficult for the united states to sanction that s where gasoline comes into play reform of gasoline subsidies has long been on the government agenda and it makes sense from an economic perspective gas prices in iran are among the cheapest in the world about 0 08 per liter before the reforms artificially cheap gasoline fuels overconsumption corruption and smuggling mainly to iran s neighbors where the gasoline is much more expensive it also limits government revenue and reduces the amount that the state petrochemical company can export even though gasoline is subject to u s sanctions it is much more difficult to restrict than crude oil oil is sold in large quantities to faraway consumers using a complex system of shipping and insurance companies ports refineries and banks providing u s authorities ample opportunities to stop transactions gasoline can be transported in small quantities using trucks or small ships directly to consumers in neighboring countries this makes it a potentially lucrative way to skirt pressure from washington ironically a policy change that will strengthen iran s resiliency in the face of american sanctions will further erode the regime s legitimacy internally the government took some steps to soften the blow and discourage protests by exempting diesel from the price increase and by including the provision of new cash handouts to 60 million people yet coercion remains at the core of the state s response the islamic republic has deployed a familiar cocktail of repression a massive police presence internet shutdown and the vilification of protesters as agents of foreign powers the regime s elites from khamenei on down are united in emphasizing the importance of these reforms the iranian state has a monopoly of force and the institutional capacity required to make tough choices about economic reforms there is little reason to doubt that iran will implement this policy and violently put down those who oppose it but iran s protests are not happening in a vacuum there is also an important regional angle here the protests in iran are echoing the ongoing protest movements in lebanon and iraq iran is deeply invested in both countries iranian clients are part and parcel of the ruling establishments hizballah in lebanon and shia militias in iraq and at the center of the corrupt machinery that the lebanese and iraqi protesters aim to overturn iran has heavily backed the status quo in both countries and has been reportedly tightly involved in the iraqi government s crackdown on protesters large segments of both publics see iran as a key obstacle against progress and change and as a guardian of corruption and nepotism in iraq especially iran has become one of the key targets of the protest movement any memory of iran s assistance in defeating the islamic state among the iraqi shia has been overcome by notions of iran as an occupying power instead of earning the goodwill of the iraqi people iran s massive political influence project in iraq has made it an arch villain a recent opinion poll found that iraqis view iran even less favorably than they view the united states iran is losing the sympathy of its co religionists in iraq and may be losing them in lebanon as well iran s entire project looks to be on shaky ground tehran has spent almost four decades building hizballah into the strongest political and military force in lebanon and it has spent the past 15 years doing the same with its shia militia clients in iraq in many respects that clientage network has made iran the most formidable power in the region but that power is not eternal iran has invested in militants militants can fight wars and take territory but they are generally poor at governance so long as conflict persists governance takes a back seat to security but once security has been established and citizens have the luxury to think about more than mere survival suddenly things like access to electricity employment education and health care begin to matter more while iran s power resides in its militant clients the legitimacy of those clients stems from the communities they represent what we are seeing in lebanon and iraq is that a significant portion of those communities particularly the young and underemployed no longer see their ruling establishments as representing the interests of the people if the protests in iran are any indication a segment of iranians has come to similar conclusions about its own leaders in all cases iran s regime is viewed as a significant part of the problem the protests in iran as well as those in lebanon and iraq compound the pressure on the ruling regime although it is perhaps unlikely that these protest movements will lead to meaningful change they evince the shaky ground undergirding the islamic republic s project both at home and in the region iran s leaders are thus facing a crossroads they can change course or they can pursue more of the same ignore the demands of the people and hope that coercion aggression and an unflinching dedication to their ambitions will be sufficient to transcend this moment unscathed iran is more likely to adopt the latter approach but as the region s recent history has shown repressing the popular desire for good governance and justice does not end that desire and could beget even further instability afshon ostovar is an assistant professor at the naval postgraduate school and a fox fellow at the foreign

stocks got off to a rocky december start on monday amid disappointing manufacturing and construction data and renewed global trade tensions the record bull run of the past month flamed out with the dow jones industrial average declining 268 points or 95 to close at 27 783 the standard poor s 500 index dropped 27 points or 86 to close at 3113 the tech laden nasdaq composite was hit particularly hard finishing at 8 567 a 97 point drop of 1 1 all this trade friction is weighing on the manufacturing sector reminding us that protectionism is not a victimless crime said kristina hooper chief global market strategist at invesco nine of 11 stock market sectors declined on monday with industrials information technology and real estate leading the slide all but seven of the dow 30 blue chips finished in negative territory with boeing american express and united technologies the biggest drags president trump threw another curve ball into the trade picture monday when he announced on twitter that he would reinstate steel and aluminum tariffs on brazil and argentina he accused the two nations of weakening their currencies to gain competitive advantage against the u s an oft repeated rebuke that he s cited in his ongoing push for lower or even negative interest rates from the federal reserve brazil and argentina have been presiding over a massive devaluation of their currencies which is not good for our farmers trump said in monday morning tweet he then pivoted to the federal reserve saying the central bank should act so that countries of which there are many no longer take advantage of our strong dollar by further devaluing their currencies this makes it very hard for our manufacturers farmers to fairly export their goods lower rates loosen fed advertisement stock futures had been trending up early monday two surveys over the weekend showed that china s manufacturing sector rallied to an eight month high in november and european manufacturing data showed a better than expected easing in the sector s contraction the strong data suggested that china s economy could be stabilizing after months of a brutal slowdown quieting some fears about the trade war

timothy fiore chair of the ism s manufacturing business survey committee said in the report with manufacturing being in deep trouble globally today s pmi reading of 48 1 could mean that the sector won

period that s typically high performing for stocks december could also bring progress on the trade front as the terms of an agreement by the united states mexico and canada could be finalized while resolution on the first phase of a trade deal with china continues to flit in and out of reach last week trump said that negotiators were in the final throes of sorting out a trade deal with china that would bring the first phase of resolution in the 16 month conflict but over the weekend china s state run newspaper the global times reported that negotiators are optimistic about a deal before the lunar new year in january but that rollbacks of tariffs are essential if a deal is to be reached in an interview with fox business on monday commerce secretary wilbur ross said progress with china has been one step forward one step backward and made it clear trump was not looking to compromise on tariffs ross said trump to move forward with the tariff increases slated for dec 15 if a phase one deal wasn t inked by then that won t interfere with this year s christmas nobody s reordering stuff after the 15th of december ross said retailers have stocked up so it s a very good time if we have to put more tariffs on advertisement when trump announced the reinstated the steel and aluminum tariffs he pointed to the strength of the markets as evidence that his hard line trade policies weren t hurting the u s economy u s markets are up as much as 21 since the announcement of tariffs on 3 1 2018 trump tweeted monday and the u s is taking in massive amounts of money and giving some to our farmers who have been targeted by china on friday a top mexican trade negotiator said that terms of a replacement for the north american free trade agreement one of the trump administration s key goals could be cemented early this week fueling hopes that congress could approve it before the end of 2019 the trump administration reached an agreement with the governments in canada and mexico last year but it must be approved by the house and the senate before the changes can become official trump s renewed tariffs on steel and aluminum dealt a surprise blow to one of brazil s most crucial industries in a vulnerable moment for the economy as unemployment hovers above 10 and growth continues to slow brazilian steel exports to the u s accounted for roughly 2 6 billion last year making the u s one of brazil s biggest markets for steel and analysts expected the tariffs to be painful in argentina where steel and aluminum exports represent roughly 700 million the unexpected news comes as the nation is undergoing a transition of power if the tariffs persist they will be one of the earliest diplomatic tests to face the incoming presidency of alberto fernández a leftist politician who will take office within a week before leaving the white house for a trip to a nato gathering in london trump told reporters he had given brazil and argentina a big break on tariffs but now i m taking that break off it s very unfair to our manufacturers and very unfair to our farmers trump said our steel companies will be very happy and our farmers will be very happy the flurry of potential trade activity is coalescing during what is typically a period of low volatility and high advances for stocks said sam stovall president of cfra research seasonal optimism typically gathers additional steam

a gathering of lebanese anti government protesters getting haircuts in front of the central bank building in beirut last week attracted many jokes and much amusement the protesters were expressing their rejection of a potential move by banks to take a proportion of their depositors money known as a haircut as a result of the country s ongoing financial crisis the demonstrators were having fun and enjoying this original way of protesting despite their fears over the uncertainty of the outcome of their popular uprising against corruption and the failures of the political classes salim sfeir the head of the association of banks in lebanon said in an interview with reuters that a haircut would not solve the problem and on the contrary would scare off customers the lebanese diaspora has plenty of money overseas and this money would never come back if there was a haircut sfeir said the lebanese economy is experiencing its worst crisis since the civil war began in 1975 government debt amounts to 88 4 billion 150 percent of lebanon s gross domestic product however despite the liquidity crisis that is endangering the country lebanon last week settled a maturing 1 5 billion eurobond signaling to the market that despite the political and economic crisis it has not defaulted but the political stalemate with the political class denying the people s demands for a new government of honest independent people is aggravating the financial situation the banks were shut at the beginning of the protest for two weeks they reopened last week but limited weekly withdrawals to 1 000 and restricted transfers abroad added to that depositors can only withdraw money in lebanese pounds which they can change for us dollars with an exchange agent as a result of this unofficial market the dollar rate reached as high as 2 000 lebanese pounds even though the currency is officially pegged to the dollar at 1 500 these measures have created panic among the people a growing fear surfaced about the possibility of banks failing to give money to their depositors the confidence of nonresident depositors has been lost banks have been targeted by many protesters some shouting at central bank governor riad salame to give us back the stolen money rumors have spread in the cities with crowds rushing to the banks to withdraw money the central bank said last week that it was allowing banks to borrow dollars without limits at 20 percent interest to secure depositors needs but stressed that the funds should not be sent abroad the institute of international finance said that deposits had dropped by more than 10 billion dollars since the end of august an important part of this money was sent abroad while more than 4 billion of it is being kept in people s homes one group of lebanese economists proposed an emergency economic rescue plan which recommended the careful management of lebanon s rapidly dwindling foreign currency reserves defending the value of the lebanese pound including tighter measures of capital control a deep fiscal plan to fight corruption new social policies to protect those most affected by the current crisis a negotiated debt reduction plan with a fair sharing of the burden across society and a monitoring mechanism that allows the people to put pressure on their leaders to implement these reforms while state oversight mechanisms are reinforced the country is on the brink of total economic collapse with people getting poorer more than 250 restaurants closing many people unable to pay for imported goods because of the dollar restrictions and hotels cutting salaries and laying off many workers unemployment is increasing rapidly the start of a solution to this catastrophic situation could come from international and regional support but only if a credible government with honest capable ministers who can inspire confidence is formed but since prime minister saad hariri s resignation president michel aoun who is constitutionally required to start consultations with parliament to nominate a replacement has been delaying the president and his foreign minister son in law gebran bassil who are allies of hezbollah are in denial over the requests of the protesters on the street they think the country can wait while they endlessly discuss with their ally hezbollah its choice of government both seem to want a mix of political and technocratic ministers to come back with the same politicians who are hated on the street the pro iran hezbollah is insisting on having hariri back on its own conditions whereas hariri insisted on a purely technocratic government as demanded by the popular will hezbollah has less to lose from the liquidity and economic crisis its money is in homes or in its caves and tunnels it has no money in lebanese banks because of american sanctions nevertheless the group has a large number of government employees who need their end of month salaries but this does not look to be a worry for hezbollah the financial crisis is being driven by the rising burden of servicing and refinancing the public debt and the sharp fall of capital inflows meanwhile hezbollah and its allies are dragging their feet with no concern for the demands of the people some observers of hezbollah s relations with iran think that usually hassan nasrallah has the leverage to act however he sees fit in lebanon but this time in view of the violent outcomes of the popular uprisings in iran and iraq tehran is pressuring hezbollah not to give in to the protesters demands the unstable political situation the serious incapacity of a political class that is eager to keep its benefits hezbollah s grip on its power to decide the kind of government it wants and the corruption of many in government and within the administration all contribute to making the future of lebanon very bleak unless something is quickly done to save it randa takieddine is a paris based lebanese journalist who headed al hayat s bureau in france for 30 years she has covered france s relations with the middle east through the terms of four presidents
business as usual has been harder borders are there other ways to address climate migration they said the hunger strike was because the eggs were moldy and the food had maggots on oct 18 some 200 detainees at the private prison known as the northwest detention center which management recently rebranded as the northwest ice processing center went on hunger strike work stoppages for detainees on kitchen detail were also held the seven day strike was the first one of the year at the center which has had many in recent memory there was more too a new head of geo group the company that owns the prison in tacoma allegedly forced detainees to stand before they entered rooms under threat of punishment including solitary confinement maru mora villalpando local activist and co founder of la resistencia which organizes against the detention center relayed what people inside were telling her we re being given trash to eat and at the same time you have these old trays and the machine doesn t really wash them the entire conditions created a moment where people went on hunger strike mora villalpando said finally because nothing was done things kept being the same way then they went on a hunger strike in the months after an activist was shot and killed outside of the processing center geo group has renamed the facility and started allowing reporters inside for what activists have called a sanitized tour in september a group of journalists were given a tour of the facility one report from q13 saw detention center employees showcasing televisions and computers to the reporter later during the tour detainees were shouting that they were hungry and not being fed around 60 of the people being held at the detention center have been shipped there from the southern border mora villalpando said children are not housed at the center meaning many of the detainees are likely separated from their families there s a lot of people from everywhere mora villalpando said obviously for those that have relatives we get a lot of calls from people outside the state trying to locate their loved ones here access to medical care is also an issue as documented in 2018 by seattle weekly nationwide around 50 000 people are locked away in immigration camps and prisons according to the federal government it s the tip of the spear of a brand of immigration policy that has been enacted by every u s president since bill clinton decided to get tough on immigration in the 1990s public radio international reports that climate change is putting pressure on central and latin america and that a system of borders camps and deportations could be the federal government s response to migrants and refugees in the coming decades predictions climate change in and of itself is only one of the factors that plays into migration kayly ober is a senior advocate for climate displacement at refugees international she said often times climate change is part of the mixture when people decide to move climate change can exacerbate some of the principal factors ober said in syria before its civil war there were issues of poor governance related to water but drought made it worse it s debatable how much the drought was caused by climate change and for that matter how much of the complex social mixture of government repression religious conflict foreign intervention and drought came together to create on of the worst refugee crisis in modern times climate change often acts as an accelerant adding fuel to existing tensions throughout the world and especially in the global south where the effects of a hotter earth will be felt more acutely the world bank in 2018 conducted a study looking at the impacts of climate change on sub saharan africa south asia and latin america the study found that in those three densely populated areas some 140 million people could become refugees many of them would likely be internal refugees moving from low lying areas of their countries that are susceptible to sea level rise for example to other places rural areas will likely become more depopulated as people head toward major cities as climate change destroys crops and makes traditional agricultural livelihoods more difficult to sustain according to the united states agency for international development but in many areas of the world traditional centers of migration like mumbai india may be unlivable closer to the u s hurricanes are likely to begin stalling over caribbean nations for longer periods of time causing more damage ober said this needs to be in the forefront of our minds as those kinds of disasters increase in the near future ober said hurricane dorian in particular stalled over the bahamas for more than 24 hours historically the u s has offered many people displaced by natural disasters temporary protected status or tps the trump administration is trying to revoke tps for hundreds of thousands of people in the country and lawsuits challenging it are ongoing according to media reports there is no special status for people fleeing the effects of climate change and ober said it is unlikely the u s will ever have a special designation or category for climate displaced people what she suggested instead would be a program similar to tps but with a pathway to citizenship local level king county is developing a new five year climate action plan which is designed for communities that will likely bear a disproportionate amount of the impact the county board of health met on nov 21 to discuss the new plan and heard from a panel comprised of people working within communities of color to address climate preparedness one panelist was nourah yonous a somali immigrant who started the organization african women business alliance she works with immigrant women to help grow and stabilize their businesses she said there will likely be an influx of climate migrants coming and that local government could do more in particular communities could use more tools to cope with climate change we are not really well prepared she said of local governments when communities of color aren t being given tangible and culturally responsive tools to address issues like displacement economic injustice or food insecurity government action doesn t lead to communities being more climate resiliant instead it s a bandage she said for that reason i think it s very important for us to know that these issues are connected she said improving public transit building more affordable energy efficient housing increasing solar and wind power and reducing transit fares could all help immigrant communities once they arrive the county will be looking at its climate plan with environmental justice as an integral part instead of an add on it could help climate immigrants and refugees here deal with some of the same issues that perhaps led them to leave countries in the first place in a wider view mora villalpando said the u s should return to immigration laws prior to the clinton crackdown in 1996 clinton signed a harsh immigration bill called the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act which restricted many ways for people to become citizens for example before the bill was signed immigrants who had been in the u s for seven years could get legal status if they showed it would cause extreme hardship to get deported vox reported this practice was ended by clinton this came on the heels of dirty wars and counter insurgency coin operations promoted and conducted u s intelligence agencies in the 1980s operations that destroyed both the governments and the social fabrics of countries throughout latin america this is the argument that investigative journalist and professor christian parenti makes dirty 80s largely left out of political discourse surrounding immigration is one of the key drivers of it u s backed violence during the cold war this ranged from supporting security forces in guatemala as they committed genocide against indigenous mayan peoples to the reagan administration smoothing over u s involvement in massacres across latin america the u s government in its quest against communism decided to back dictators in chile argentina peru el salvador nicaragua guatemala uruguay and more many of these regimes committed human rights abuses for example the u s backed the right wing military government in el salvador which left 75 000 dead in 2009 the obama administration and hillary clinton supported a coup in honduras that destabilized the country the u s also conducted or promoted counter insurgency coin operations these operations are distinct from traditional warfare parenti said whereas traditional warfare focuses on capturing and controlling territory counter insurgency relies on prying insurgents from their support base this results often in the destruction of traditional societal ties breaking apart countries following decades of intervention much of latin america was left with weakened governments a fragmented society and a power vacuum that allowed gangs and narcotics trafficking to set up shop the u s proxy wars in central america in the 1980s were really damaging to the social fabric because those were counter insurgency conflicts parenti said the counter insurgency in central america in the 1980s seeded the region with a kind of trauma that kind of shows up as astonishing levels of violence this was something mora villalpando also talked about countries currently experiencing upheaval in latin america have generally experienced either u s backed violence or have been stricken by international monetary fund austerity and have been pressured to cut social safety nets and services it is important to realize that when people complain about migration there s a lot to blame to the united states government in creating the conditions in the first place and forcing us to migrate mora villalpando said mora villalpando who herself is undocumented said she left mexico in the 1990s before nafta was signed the free trade agreement flooded the country with cheap international goods forcing local producers and farmers out of the market and often into poverty parenti reports that all this sets the stage for even greater effects from climate change as weakened governments are less likely to be able to respond to natural and economic disasters mora villalpando said migration is likely to continue along the southern border and even increase in coming decades as climate change affects them more severely than countries in the global north the impact is not going to be on those nations it s going to be on the global south they don t have any other recourse mora villalpando said migration will explode in numbers divorced from its historical roots more people seeking refuge in the u s provides ample political fodder for nationalist rhetoric in the u s every u s president since clinton has deported hundreds of thousands of people climate change and the armed lifeboat in the 1970s ecologist garrett hardin developed an anti immigration strain of political reasoning it goes something like this say there s a lifeboat with room for five but there s 20 passengers in the water what should be done hardin argued that if all the people come onto the lifeboat everyone dies resources should be protected even at the expense of others this is the type of thinking that parenti argues governments seem to be adopting in the global north from european countries building fences to keep out syrian refugees to u s presidents including obama and trump appeasing nationalist sentiments to more heavily enforce the southern border countries around the world are sending a message to current and future refugees and migrants parenti doesn t think it s necessarily an organized response to climate change but may set a precedent for how the u s could respond as climate change leads to increased immigration the u s military has been preparing for climate destabilization since at least 2004 according to the guardian even as politicans tried to cast doubt on the scientific consensus that climate change is happening immigrant workers can benefit the economy parenti said but currently undocumented workers face a number of hurdles and are more vulnerable to exploitation increasing rights for immigrants and workers could help combat the idea of the armed lifeboat to have a section of the working class that is without legal rights and is terrified and will not join unions that harms the entire working population parenti said so people need to realize that it is in their immediate and direct economic self interest to make sure that immigrant workers have the right to struggle for their rights as workers granting more protection to immigrants climate driven or otherwise would help give people power parenti said if employers couldn t pay a segment of undocumented workers less than natural born workers more legal protection would raise wages for everyone parenti said he s also in favor of a green new deal and buying into green technology while removing subsidies for the fossil fuel industry jobs packages have been a topic in green new deal discussions as has the idea of medicare for all which could help soften the blows from climate change for everyone ultimately though americans could have a choice continue with business as usual or find new ways to handle migrants and refugees as climate change and the legacy of u s cold war policy affect their neighbors to the south for us it s very important to explain that what the current administration s policy is doing is the same mora villalpando said it s just 10 times bigger

nationwide around 50 000 people are locked away in immigration camps and prisons according to the federal government it s the tip of the spear of a brand of immigration policy that has been enacted by every u s president since bill clinton decided to get tough on immigration in the 1990s public radio international reports that climate change is putting pressure on central and latin america and that a system of borders camps and deportations could be the federal government s response to migrants and refugees in the coming decades predictions climate change in and of itself is only one of the factors that plays into migration kayly ober is a senior advocate for climate displacement at refugees international she said often times climate change is part of the mixture when people decide to

how much the drought was caused by climate change and for that matter how much of the complex social mixture of government repression religious conflict foreign intervention and drought came together to create on of the worst refugee crisis in modern times climate change often acts as an accelerant adding fuel to existing tensions throughout the world and especially in the global south where the effects of a hotter earth will be felt more acutely the world bank in 2018 conducted a study looking at the impacts of climate change on sub saharan africa south asia and latin america the study found that in those three densely populated areas some 140 million people could become refugees many of them would likely be internal refugees moving from low lying areas of their countries that are susceptible to sea level rise for example to other places rural areas will likely become more depopulated as people head toward major cities as climate change destroys crops and makes traditional agricultural livelihoods more difficult to sustain according to the united states agency for international development but in many areas of the world traditional centers of migration like mumbai india may be unlivable closer to the u s hurricanes are likely to begin stalling over caribbean nations for longer periods of time causing more damage ober said this needs to be in the forefront of our minds as those kinds of disasters increase in the near future ober said hurricane dorian in particular stalled over the bahamas for more than 24 hours historically the u s has offered many people displaced by natural disasters temporary protected status or tps the trump administration is trying to revoke tps for hundreds of thousands of people in the country and lawsuits challenging it are ongoing according to media reports there is no special status for people fleeing the effects of climate change and ober said it is unlikely the u s will ever have a special designation or category for climate displaced people what she suggested instead would be a program similar to tps but with a pathway to citizenship local level king county is developing a new five year climate action plan which is designed for communities that will likely bear a disproportionate amount of the impact the county board of health met on nov 21 to discuss the new plan and heard from a panel comprised of people working within communities of color to address climate preparedness one panelist was nourah yonous a somali immigrant who started the organization african women business alliance she works with immigrant women to help grow and stabilize their businesses she said there will likely be an influx of climate migrants coming and that local government could do more in particular communities could use more tools to cope with climate change we are not really well prepared she said of local governments when communities of color aren t being given tangible and culturally responsive tools to address issues like displacement economic injustice or food insecurity government action doesn t lead to communities being more climate resiliant instead it s a bandage she said for that reason i think it s very important for us to know that these issues are connected she said improving public transit building more affordable energy efficient housing increasing solar and wind power and reducing transit fares could all help immigrant communities once they arrive the county will be looking at its climate plan with environmental justice as an integral part instead of an add on it could help climate immigrants and refugees here deal with some of the same issues that perhaps led them to leave countries in the first place in a wider view mora villalpando said the u s should return to immigration laws prior to the clinton crackdown in 1996 clinton signed a harsh immigration bill called the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act which restricted many ways for people to become citizens for example before the bill was signed immigrants who had been in the u s for seven years could get legal status if they showed it would cause extreme hardship to get deported vox reported this practice was ended by clinton this came on the heels of dirty wars and counter insurgency coin operations promoted and conducted u s intelligence agencies in the 1980s operations that destroyed both the governments and the social fabrics of countries throughout latin america this is the argument that investigative journalist and professor christian parenti makes dirty 80s largely left out of political discourse surrounding immigration is one of the key drivers of it u s backed violence during the cold war this ranged from supporting security forces in guatemala as they committed genocide against indigenous mayan peoples to the reagan administration smoothing over u s involvement in massacres across latin america the u s government in its quest against communism decided to back dictators in chile argentina peru el salvador nicaragua guatemala uruguay and more many of these regimes committed human rights abuses for example the u s backed the right wing military government in el salvador which left 75 000 dead in 2009 the obama administration and hillary clinton supported a coup in honduras that destabilized the country the u s also conducted or promoted counter insurgency coin operations these operations are distinct from traditional warfare parenti said whereas traditional warfare focuses on capturing and controlling territory counter insurgency relies on prying insurgents from their support base this results often in the destruction of traditional societal ties breaking apart countries following decades of intervention much of latin america was left with weakened governments a fragmented society and a power vacuum that allowed gangs and narcotics trafficking to set up shop the u s proxy wars in central america in the 1980s were really damaging to the social fabric because those were counter insurgency conflicts parenti said the counter insurgency in central america in the 1980s seeded the region with a kind of trauma that kind of shows up as astonishing levels of violence this was something mora villalpando also talked about countries currently experiencing upheaval in latin america have generally experienced either u s backed violence or have been stricken by international monetary fund austerity and have been pressured to cut social safety nets and services it is important to realize that when people complain about migration there s a lot to blame to the united states government in creating the conditions in the first place and forcing us to migrate mora villalpando said mora villalpando who herself is undocumented said she left mexico in the 1990s before nafta was signed the free trade agreement flooded the country with cheap international goods forcing local producers and farmers out of the market and often into poverty parenti reports that all this sets the stage for even greater effects from climate change as weakened governments are less likely to be able to respond to natural and economic disasters mora villalpando said migration is likely to continue along the southern border and even increase in coming decades as climate change affects them more severely than countries in the global north the impact is not going to be on those nations it s going to be on the global south they don t have any other recourse mora villalpando said migration will explode in numbers divorced from its historical roots more people seeking refuge in the u s provides ample political fodder for nationalist rhetoric in the u s every u s president since clinton has deported hundreds of thousands of people climate change and the armed lifeboat in the 1970s ecologist garrett hardin developed an anti immigration strain of political reasoning it goes something like this say there s a lifeboat with room for five but there s 20 passengers in the water what should be done hardin argued that if all the people come onto the lifeboat everyone dies resources should be protected even at the expense of others this is the type of thinking that parenti argues governments seem to be adopting in the global north from european countries building fences to keep out syrian refugees to u s presidents including obama and trump appeasing nationalist sentiments to more heavily enforce the southern border countries around the world are sending a message to current and future refugees and migrants parenti doesn t think it s necessarily an organized response to climate change but may set a precedent for how the u s could respond as climate change leads to increased immigration the u s military has been preparing for climate destabilization since at least 2004 according to the guardian even as politicans tried to cast doubt on the scientific consensus that climate change is happening immigrant workers can benefit the economy parenti said but currently undocumented workers face a number of hurdles and are more vulnerable to exploitation increasing rights for immigrants and workers could help combat the idea of the armed lifeboat to have a section of the working class that is without legal rights and is terrified and will not join unions that harms the entire working population parenti said so people need to realize that it is in their immediate and direct economic self interest to make sure that immigrant workers have the right to struggle for their rights as workers granting more protection to immigrants climate driven or otherwise would help give people power parenti said if employers couldn t pay a segment of undocumented workers less than natural born workers more legal protection would raise wages for everyone parenti said he s also in favor of a green new deal and buying into green technology while removing subsidies for the fossil fuel industry jobs packages have been a topic in green new deal discussions as has the idea of medicare for all which could help soften the blows from climate change for everyone ultimately though americans could have a choice continue with business as usual or find new ways to handle migrants and refugees as climate change and the legacy of u s cold war policy affect their neighbors to

reducing transit fares could all help immigrant communities once they arrive the county will be looking at its climate plan with environmental justice as an integral part instead of an add on it could help climate immigrants and refugees here deal with some of the same issues that perhaps led them to leave countries in the first place in a wider view mora villalpando said the u s should return to immigration laws prior to the clinton crackdown in 1996 clinton signed a harsh immigration bill called the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act which restricted many ways for people to become citizens for example before the bill was signed immigrants who had been in the u s for seven years could get legal status if they showed it would cause extreme hardship to get deported vox reported this practice was ended by clinton this came on the heels of dirty wars and counter insurgency coin operations promoted and conducted u s intelligence agencies in the 1980s operations that destroyed both the governments and the social fabrics of countries throughout latin america this is the argument that investigative journalist and professor christian parenti makes dirty 80s largely left out of political discourse surrounding immigration is one of the key drivers of it u s backed violence during the cold war this ranged from supporting security forces in guatemala as they committed genocide against indigenous mayan peoples to the reagan administration smoothing over u s involvement in massacres across latin america the u s government in its quest against communism decided to back dictators in chile argentina peru el salvador nicaragua guatemala uruguay and more many of these regimes committed human rights abuses for example the u s backed the right wing military government in el salvador which left 75 000 dead in 2009 the obama administration and hillary clinton supported a coup in honduras that destabilized the country the u s also conducted or promoted counter insurgency coin operations these operations are distinct from traditional warfare parenti said whereas traditional warfare focuses on capturing and controlling territory counter insurgency relies on prying insurgents from their support base this results often in the destruction of traditional societal ties breaking apart countries following decades of intervention much of latin america was left with weakened governments a fragmented society and a power vacuum that allowed gangs and narcotics trafficking to set up shop the u s proxy wars in central america in the 1980s were really damaging to the social fabric because those were counter insurgency conflicts parenti said the counter insurgency in central america in the 1980s seeded the region with a kind of trauma that kind of shows up as astonishing levels of violence this was something mora villalpando also talked about countries currently experiencing upheaval in latin america have generally experienced either u s backed violence or have been stricken by international monetary fund austerity and have been pressured to cut social safety nets and services it is important to realize that when people complain about migration there s a lot to blame to the united states government in creating the conditions in the first place and forcing us to migrate mora villalpando said mora villalpando who herself is undocumented said she left mexico in the 1990s before nafta was signed the free trade agreement flooded the country with cheap international goods forcing local producers and farmers out of the market and often into poverty parenti reports that all this sets the stage for even greater effects from climate change as weakened governments are less likely to be able to respond to natural and economic disasters mora villalpando said migration is likely to continue along the southern border and even increase in coming decades as climate change affects them more severely than countries in the global north the impact is not going to be on those nations it s going to be on the global south they don t have any other recourse mora villalpando said migration will explode in numbers divorced from its historical roots more people seeking refuge in the u s provides ample political fodder for nationalist rhetoric in the u s every u s president since clinton has deported hundreds of thousands of people climate change and the armed lifeboat in the 1970s ecologist garrett hardin developed an anti immigration strain of political reasoning it goes something like this say there s a lifeboat with room for five but there s 20 passengers in the water what should be done hardin argued that if all the people come onto the lifeboat everyone dies resources should be protected even at the expense of others this is the type of thinking that parenti argues governments seem to be adopting in the global north from european countries building fences to keep out syrian refugees to u s presidents including obama and trump appeasing nationalist sentiments to more heavily enforce the southern border countries around the world are sending a message to current and future refugees and migrants parenti doesn t think it s necessarily an organized response to climate change but may set a precedent for how the u s could respond as climate change leads to increased immigration the u s military has been preparing for climate destabilization since at least 2004 according to the guardian even as politicans tried to cast doubt on the scientific consensus that climate change is happening immigrant workers can benefit the economy parenti said but currently undocumented workers face a number of hurdles and are more vulnerable to exploitation increasing rights for immigrants and workers could help combat the idea of the armed lifeboat to have a section of the working class that is without legal rights and is terrified and will not join unions that harms the entire working population parenti said so people need to realize that it is in their immediate and direct economic self interest to make sure that immigrant workers have the right to struggle for their rights as workers granting more protection to immigrants climate driven or otherwise would help give people power parenti said if employers couldn t pay a segment of undocumented workers less than natural born workers more legal protection would raise wages for everyone parenti said he s also in favor of a green new deal and buying into green technology while removing subsidies for the fossil fuel industry jobs packages have been a topic in green new deal discussions as has the idea of medicare for all which could help soften the blows from climate change for everyone ultimately though americans could have a choice continue with business as usual or find new ways to handle migrants and refugees as climate change and the legacy of u s cold war policy affect their neighbors to the south for us it s very important to explain that what the current administration s policy is doing is the same mora villalpando said it s just 10 times bigger

period that s typically high performing for stocks december could also bring progress on the trade front as the terms of an agreement by the united states mexico and canada could be finalized while resolution on the first phase of a trade deal with china continues to flit in and out of reach the trade picture darkened monday after president donald trump announced on twitter that he would reinstate steel and aluminum tariffs on brazil and argentina he accused the two nations of weakening their currencies to gain competitive advantage against the u s an oft repeated rebuke that he s cited in his ongoing push for lower or even negative interest rates from the federal reserve brazil and argentina have been presiding over a massive devaluation of their currencies which is not good for our farmers trump said in monday morning tweet he then pivoted to the federal reserve saying the central bank should act so that countries of which there are many no longer take advantage of our strong dollar by further devaluing their currencies this makes it very hard for our farmers to fairly export their goods lower rates loosen fed stock futures had been trending up before trump s early morning announcement by midmorning the dow jones industrial average had shed more than 200 points or 0 7 the standard poor s 500 index was down 0 9 and the tech heavy nasdaq was down 1 4 the president

tariff man and this long trade battle with america s trading partners isn t over yet futures markets had swung higher on trade optimism and signs of recovery in global manufacturing two surveys over the weekend showed that china s manufacturing sector rallied to an eight month high in november and european manufacturing data showed a better than expected easing in the sector s contraction the strong data suggested that china s economy could be stabilizing after months of a brutal slowdown quieting some fears about the trade war s toll on one of the world s most powerful economic engines meanwhile u s manufacturing disappointed in november according to monday s report from the institute for supply management its manufacturing index dropped to 48 1 in november from 48 3 in october coming in well below analyst expectations readings below 50 indicate business conditions are getting worse global trade remains the most significant cross industry issue timothy fiore chair of the ism s manufacturing business survey committee said in the report last week trump said that negotiators were in the final throes of sorting out a trade deal with china that would bring the first phase of resolution in the 16 month conflict but over the weekend china s state run newspaper the global times reported that negotiators are optimistic about a deal before the lunar new year in january but that rollbacks of tariffs are essential if a deal is to be reached on friday a top mexican trade negotiator said that terms of a replacement for the north american free trade agreement one of the trump administration s key goals could be cemented early this week fueling hopes that congress could approve it before the end of 2019 the trump administration reached an agreement with the governments in canada and mexico last year but it must be approved by the house and the senate before the changes can become official trump s renewed tariffs on steel and aluminum dealt a surprise blow to one of brazil s most crucial industries in a vulnerable moment for the economy as unemployment hovers above 10 and growth continues to slow brazilian steel exports to the u s accounted for roughly 2 6 billion last year making the u s one of brazil s biggest markets for steel and analysts expected the tariffs to be painful the flurry of potential trade activity is coalescing during what

people to become citizens for example before the bill was signed immigrants who had been in the u s for seven years could get legal status if they showed it would cause extreme hardship to get deported vox reported this practice was ended by clinton this came on the heels of dirty wars and counter insurgency coin operations promoted and conducted u s intelligence agencies in the 1980s operations that destroyed both the governments and the social fabrics of countries throughout latin america this is the argument that investigative journalist and professor christian parenti makes dirty 80s largely left out of political discourse surrounding immigration is one of the key drivers of it u s backed violence during the cold war this ranged from supporting security forces in guatemala as they committed genocide against indigenous mayan peoples to the reagan administration smoothing over u s involvement in massacres across latin america the u s government in its quest against communism decided to back dictators in chile argentina peru el salvador nicaragua guatemala uruguay and more many of these regimes committed human rights abuses for example the u s backed the right wing military government in el salvador which left 75 000 dead in 2009 the obama administration and hillary clinton supported a coup in honduras that destabilized the country the u s also conducted or promoted counter insurgency coin operations these operations are distinct from traditional warfare parenti said whereas traditional warfare focuses on capturing and controlling territory counter insurgency relies on prying insurgents from their support base this results often in the destruction of traditional societal ties breaking apart countries following decades of intervention much of latin america was left with weakened governments a fragmented society and a power vacuum that allowed gangs and narcotics trafficking to set up shop the u s proxy wars in central america in the 1980s were really damaging to the social fabric because those were counter insurgency conflicts parenti said the counter insurgency in central america in the 1980s seeded the region with a kind of trauma that kind of shows up as astonishing levels of violence this was something mora villalpando also talked about countries currently experiencing upheaval in latin america have generally experienced either u s backed violence or have been stricken by international monetary fund austerity and have been pressured to cut social safety nets and services it is important to realize that when people complain about migration there s a lot to blame to the united states government in creating the conditions in the first place and forcing us to migrate mora villalpando said mora villalpando who herself is undocumented said she left mexico in the 1990s before nafta was signed the free trade agreement flooded the country with cheap international goods forcing local producers and farmers out of the market and often into poverty parenti reports that all this sets the stage for even greater effects from climate change as weakened governments are less likely to be able to respond to natural and economic disasters mora villalpando said migration is likely to continue along the southern border and even increase in coming decades as climate change affects them more severely than countries in the global north the impact is not going to be on those nations it s going to be on the global south they don t have any other recourse mora villalpando said migration will explode in numbers divorced from its historical roots more people seeking refuge in the u s provides ample political fodder for nationalist rhetoric in the u s every u s president since clinton has deported hundreds of thousands of people climate change and the armed lifeboat in the 1970s ecologist garrett hardin developed an anti immigration strain of political reasoning it goes something like this say there s a lifeboat with room for five but there s 20 passengers in the water what should be done hardin argued that if all the people come onto the lifeboat everyone dies resources should be protected even at the expense of others this is the type of thinking that parenti argues governments seem to be adopting in the global north from european countries building fences to keep out syrian refugees to u s presidents including obama and trump appeasing nationalist sentiments to more heavily enforce the southern border countries around the world are sending a message to current and future refugees and migrants parenti doesn t think it s necessarily an organized response to climate change but may set a precedent for how the u s could respond as climate change leads to increased immigration the u s military has been preparing for climate destabilization since at least 2004 according to the guardian even as politicans tried to cast doubt on the scientific consensus that climate change is happening immigrant workers can benefit the economy parenti said but currently undocumented workers face a number of hurdles and are more vulnerable to exploitation increasing rights for immigrants and workers could help combat the idea of the armed lifeboat to have a section of the working class that is without legal rights and is terrified and will not join unions that harms the entire working population parenti said so people need to realize that it is in their immediate and direct economic self interest to make sure that immigrant workers have the right to struggle for their rights as workers granting more protection to immigrants climate driven or otherwise would help give people power parenti said if employers couldn t pay a segment of undocumented workers less than natural born workers more legal protection would raise wages for everyone parenti said he s also in favor of a green new deal and buying into green technology while removing subsidies for the fossil fuel industry jobs packages have been a topic in green new deal discussions as has the idea of medicare for all which could help soften the blows from climate change for everyone ultimately though americans could have a choice continue with business as usual or find new ways to handle migrants and refugees as climate change and the legacy of u s cold war policy affect their neighbors to the south for us it s very important to explain that what the current administration s policy is doing is the same mora villalpando said it s just 10 times bigger
there are two contrasting contexts as far as the competitiveness of bangladesh economy is concerned on the one hand the economic growth rate in bangladesh has been increasing since 2013 it increased from 6 percent in that year to a staggering 7 9 percent in 2018 on the other hand during the same period according to the global competitiveness index gci out of 152 countries the ranking of bangladesh slipped from 99 to 118 and the gci value saw a secular decline from 3 91 to 3 65 does this mean that competitiveness is not an issue as far as accelerating economic growth in bangladesh is concerned according to the world economic forum the gci is a set of institutions policies and factors that determine the level of productivity of a country the gci 2019 identifies 12 major areas which are used to construct the aggregate gci these are institutions infrastructure macroeconomic environment health and education higher education and training goods market efficiency labour market efficiency financial sector development technological readiness market size business sophistication and innovation in most of these areas bangladesh s scores are very poor in comparison to bangladesh s major competitors in the global market like china india and vietnam bangladesh is significantly lagging behind them in all the gci areas except the macroeconomic environment given the current global and domestic economic scenarios it is hard to believe that competitiveness is not an issue for further accelerating and sustaining economic growth in bangladesh the country is expected to graduate from the least developed country ldc status by 2024 this will lead to several challenges for the country s export sector due to the loss of preference in its major export destinations the country expects to achieve the stringent sdgs by 2030 and also eyes to become an upper middle income country by 2031 and a high income country by 2041 there are also changing global trade scenarios the ongoing trade war between the usa and china the brexit the collapse of the multilateral trade negotiations under the wto growing protectionism in the developed countries china s belt and road initiative bri and the emergence of mega trading blocs are examples of the changing global trade scenarios on the domestic front the country s economic growth prospect is closely linked to the growth in exports remittances and private sector investment however there have been a slowdown in growth in exports and remittances over the past few years also sluggish private sector investment over the past few years remains a big concern all these have been accompanied by the falling trend in export gdp remittance gdp and fdi gdp ratios in recent years moreover the export basket of the country persists to be highly concentrated around the rmg and the diversification efforts over the past few decades have not seen much success even if we look at the rmg exports of bangladesh which now occupy around 84 percent of the total exports the rmg export basket is also highly concentrated at the 6 digit hs code level only 10 rmg products account for 68 percent of the total rmg exports the corresponding figures for china india and vietnam are 36 percent 46 percent and 42 percent respectively the scenario of the inflow of foreign direct investment fdi in bangladesh is frustrating the fdi share in gdp in 2018 in bangladesh was even lower than the ldc average during 2014 and 2018 on average bangladesh s fdi gdp ratio was 1 2 percent and bangladesh attracted usd 2 5 billion fdi annually by contrast during the same period the average fdi gdp ratio of vietnam was 6 percent and the annual average fdi inflow was usd 12 6 billion the upshot of the above discussion points to the fact that there is a need for significantly enhancing the competitiveness of our economy in the coming years to address the aforementioned challenges and meeting the development goals there are two types of competitiveness price and non price competitiveness while price competitiveness is dependent on labour costs relative inflation and real effective exchange rate reer the non price competitiveness is dependent on a number of issues including product quality and design business research and development r d strength of local brands effectiveness of marketing in overseas markets levels of dynamic efficiency of firms levels of x inefficiency poor management excessive bureaucracy government failures and investment in human capital for skill development there is no denying the fact that while in terms of labour costs bangladesh has a competitive advantage over many of its competitors in the case of other components of price competitiveness and most of the components of non price competitiveness bangladesh is seriously lagging behind its major competitors the economy is now witnessing a gradual appreciation of the real effective exchange rate which is eroding the competitiveness of bangladesh s exports low average years of schooling and very low public expenditure on both education and health as percentages of gdp are resulting in stagnation in skill development and skill diversification there is a need to undertake reform in critical economic domains including the financial sector taxation sector trade and exchange rate policies and business environment faster and cost effective implementation of the mega projects and special economic zones attracting large scale fdi addressing institutional challenges in export diversification substantial spending on research and development and making skill development and skill diversification a national priority are the steps towards enhancing the country s competitiveness there is no doubt that we also need to come out of the so called comfort zone created by the glossy picture of an ever increasing gdp growth rate dr selim raihan is professor department of economics university of dhaka bangladesh and executive director south asian network on economic modeling sanem email

have been presiding over a massive devaluation of their currencies which is not good for our farmers trump tweeted monday he then pivoted to the federal reserve saying the central bank should act so that countries of which there are many no longer take advantage of our strong dollar by further devaluing their currencies this makes it very hard for our manufactures farmers to fairly export their goods lower rates loosen fed stock futures had been trending up monday after two surveys over the weekend showed that china s manufacturing sector rallied to an eight month high in november and

in the final throes of sorting out a trade deal with china that would bring the first phase of resolution in the 16 month conflict but over the weekend china s state run newspaper the global times

trump told reporters he had given brazil and argentina a big break on tariffs but now i m taking that break off advertisement it s very unfair to our manufacturers and very unfair to our farmers trump

business as usual has been harder borders are there other ways to address climate migration they said the hunger strike was because the eggs were moldy and the food had maggots on oct 18 some 200 detainees at the private prison known as the northwest detention center which management recently rebranded as the northwest ice processing center went on hunger strike work stoppages for detainees on kitchen detail were also held the seven day strike was the first one of the year at the center which has had many in recent memory there was more too a new head of geo group the company that owns the prison in tacoma allegedly forced detainees to stand before they entered rooms under threat of punishment including solitary confinement maru mora villalpando local activist and co founder of la resistencia which organizes against the detention center relayed what people inside were telling her we re being given trash to eat and at the same time you have these old trays and the machine doesn t really wash them the entire conditions created a moment where people went on hunger strike mora villalpando said finally because nothing was done things kept being the same way then they went on a hunger strike in the months after an activist was shot and killed outside of the processing center geo group has renamed the facility and started allowing reporters inside for what activists have called a sanitized tour in september a group of journalists were given a tour of the facility one report from q13 saw detention center employees showcasing televisions and computers to the reporter later during the tour detainees were shouting that they were hungry and not being fed around 60 of the people being held at the detention center have been shipped there from the southern border mora villalpando said children are not housed at the center meaning many of the detainees are likely separated from their families there s a lot of people from everywhere mora villalpando said obviously for those that have relatives we get a lot of calls from people outside the state trying to locate their loved ones here access to medical care is also an issue as documented in 2018 by seattle weekly nationwide around 50 000 people are locked away in immigration camps and prisons according to the federal government it s the tip of the spear of a brand of immigration policy that has been enacted by every u s president since bill clinton decided to get tough on immigration in the 1990s public radio international reports that climate change is putting pressure on central and latin america and that a system of borders camps and deportations could be the federal government s response to migrants and refugees in the coming decades predictions climate change in and of itself is only one of the factors that plays into migration kayly ober is a senior advocate for climate displacement at refugees international she said often times climate change is part of the mixture when people decide to move climate change can exacerbate some of the principal factors ober said in syria before its civil war there were issues of poor governance related to water but drought made it worse it s debatable how much the drought was caused by climate change and for that matter how much of the complex social mixture of government repression religious conflict foreign intervention and drought came together to create on of the worst refugee crisis in modern times climate change often acts as an accelerant adding fuel to existing tensions throughout the world and especially in the global south where the effects of a hotter earth will be felt more acutely the world bank in 2018 conducted a study looking at the impacts of climate change on sub saharan africa south asia and latin america the study found that in those three densely populated areas some 140 million people could become refugees many of them would likely be internal refugees moving from low lying areas of their countries that are susceptible to sea level rise for example to other places rural areas will likely become more depopulated as people head toward major cities as climate change destroys crops and makes traditional agricultural livelihoods more difficult to sustain according to the united states agency for international development but in many areas of the world traditional centers of migration like mumbai india may be unlivable closer to the u s hurricanes are likely to begin stalling over caribbean nations for longer periods of time causing more damage ober said this needs to be in the forefront of our minds as those kinds of disasters increase in the near future ober said hurricane dorian in particular stalled over the bahamas for more than 24 hours historically the u s has offered many people displaced by natural disasters temporary protected status or tps the trump administration is trying to revoke tps for hundreds of thousands of people in the country and lawsuits challenging it are ongoing according to media reports there is no special status for people fleeing the effects of climate change and ober said it is unlikely the u s will ever have a special designation or category for climate displaced people what she suggested instead would be a program similar to tps but with a pathway to citizenship local level king county is developing a new five year climate action plan which

right wing military government in el salvador which left 75 000 dead in 2009 the obama administration and hillary clinton supported a coup in honduras that destabilized the country the u s also conducted or promoted counter insurgency coin operations these operations are distinct from traditional warfare parenti said whereas traditional warfare focuses on capturing and controlling territory counter insurgency relies on prying insurgents from their support base this results often in the destruction of traditional societal ties breaking apart countries following decades of intervention much of latin america was left with weakened governments a fragmented society and a power vacuum that allowed gangs and narcotics trafficking to set up shop the u s proxy wars in central america in the 1980s were really damaging to the social fabric because those were counter insurgency conflicts parenti said the counter insurgency in central america in the 1980s seeded the region with a kind of trauma that kind of shows up as astonishing levels of violence this was something mora villalpando also talked about countries currently experiencing upheaval in latin america have generally experienced either u s backed violence or have been stricken by international monetary fund austerity and have been pressured to cut social safety nets and services it is important to realize that when people complain about migration there s a lot to blame to the united states government in creating the conditions in the first place and forcing us to migrate mora villalpando said mora villalpando who herself is undocumented said she left mexico in the 1990s before nafta was signed the free trade agreement flooded the country with cheap international goods forcing local producers and farmers out of the market and often into poverty parenti reports that all this sets the stage for even greater effects from climate change as weakened governments are less likely to be able to respond to natural and economic disasters mora villalpando said migration is likely to continue along the southern border and even increase in coming decades as climate change affects them more severely than countries in the global north the impact is not going to be on those nations it s going to be on the global south they don t have any other recourse mora villalpando said migration will explode in numbers divorced from its historical roots more people seeking refuge in the u s provides ample political fodder for nationalist rhetoric in the u s every u s president since clinton has deported hundreds of thousands of people climate change and the armed lifeboat in the 1970s ecologist garrett hardin developed an anti immigration strain of political reasoning it goes something like this say there s a lifeboat with room for five but there s 20 passengers in the water what should be done hardin argued that if all the people come onto the lifeboat everyone dies resources should be protected even at the expense of others this is the type of thinking that parenti argues governments seem to be adopting in the global north from european countries building fences to keep out syrian refugees to u s presidents including obama and trump appeasing nationalist sentiments to more heavily enforce the southern border countries around the world are sending a message to current and future refugees and migrants parenti doesn t think it s necessarily an organized response to climate change but may set a precedent for how the u s could respond as climate change leads to increased immigration the u s military has been preparing for climate destabilization since at least 2004 according to the guardian even as politicans tried to cast doubt on the scientific consensus that climate change is happening immigrant workers can benefit the economy parenti said but currently undocumented workers face a number of hurdles and are more vulnerable to exploitation increasing rights for immigrants and workers could help combat the idea of the armed lifeboat to have a section of the working class that is without legal rights and is terrified and will not join unions that harms the entire working population parenti said so people need to realize that it is in their immediate and direct economic self interest to make sure that immigrant workers have the right to struggle for their rights as workers granting more protection to immigrants climate driven or otherwise would help give people power parenti said if employers couldn t pay a segment of undocumented workers less than natural born workers more legal protection would raise wages for everyone parenti said he s also in favor of a green new deal and buying into green technology while removing subsidies for the fossil fuel industry jobs packages have been a topic in green new deal discussions as has the idea of medicare for all which could help soften the blows from climate change for everyone ultimately though americans could have a choice continue with business as usual or find new ways to handle migrants and refugees as climate change and the legacy of u s cold war policy affect their neighbors to the south for us it s very important to explain that what the current administration s policy is doing is the same mora villalpando said it s just 10 times bigger
zombie companies in china crippling student bills in america sky high mortgages in australia another default scare in argentina a decade of easy money has left the world with a record 250 trillion of government corporate and household debt that s almost three times global economic output and equates to about 32 500 for every man woman and child on earth much of that legacy stems from policy makers deliberate efforts to use borrowing to keep the global economy afloat in the wake of the financial crisis rock bottom interest rates in the years since have kept the burden manageable for most allowing the debt mountain to keep growing now as policy makers grapple with the slowest growth since that era a suite of options on how to revive their economies share a common denominator yet more debt from green new deals to modern monetary theory proponents of deficit spending argue central banks are exhausted and that massive fiscal spending is needed to yank companies and households out of their funk fiscal hawks argue such proposals will merely sow the seeds for more trouble but the needle seems to be shifting on how much debt an economy can safely carry central bankers and policy makers from european central bank president christine lagarde to the international monetary fund have been urging governments to do more arguing it s a good time to borrow for projects that will reap economic dividends previous conventional wisdom about advanced economy speed limits regarding debt to gdp ratios may be changing said mark sobel a former us treasury and international monetary fund official given lower interest bills and markets pent up demand for safe assets major advanced economies may well be able to sustain higher debt loads a constraint for policy makers though is the legacy of past spending as pockets of credit stress litter the globe at the sovereign level argentina s newly elected government has promised to renegotiate a record 56 billion credit line with the imf stoking memories of the nation s economic collapse and debt default in 2001 turkey south africa and others have also had scares as for corporate debt american companies alone account for around 70 per cent of this year s total corporate defaults even amid a record economic expansion and in china companies defaulting in the onshore market are likely to hit a record next year according to s p global ratings so called zombie companies firms that are unable to cover debt servicing costs from operating profits over an extended period and have muted growth prospects have risen to around 6 per cent of non financial listed shares in advanced economies a multi decade high according to the bank for international settlements that hurts both healthier competitors and productivity as for households australia and south korea rank among the most indebted the debt drag is hanging over the next generation of workers too in the us students now owe 1 5 trillion and are struggling to pay it off even if debt is cheap it can be tough to escape once the load gets too heavy while solid economic growth is the easiest way out that isn t always forthcoming instead policy makers have to navigate balances and trade offs between austerity financial repression where savers subsidize borrowers or default and debt forgiveness the best is to grow out of it gradually and consistently and it is the solution to many but not all episodes of current indebtedness said mohamed el erian chief economic adviser to allianz se policy makers are plowing on in the hope of such an outcome to shore up the us recovery the federal reserve lowered interest rates three times this year even as a tax cut funded fiscal stimulus sends the nation s deficit toward 5 per cent of gdp japan is mulling fresh spending while monetary policy remains ultra easy and in what s described as britain s most consequential election in decades both major parties have promised a return to public spending levels last seen in the 1970s china is holding the line for now as it tries to keep a lid on debt with a drip feed of liquidity injections rather than all out monetary easing on the fiscal front it has cut taxes and brought forward bond sale quotas rather than resort to the spending binges seen in past cycles

business as usual has been harder borders are there other ways to address climate migration they said the hunger strike was because the eggs were moldy and the food had maggots on oct 18 some 200 detainees at the private prison known as the northwest detention center which management recently rebranded as the northwest ice processing center went on hunger strike work stoppages for detainees on kitchen detail were also held the seven day strike was the first one of the year at the center which has had many in recent memory there was more too a new head of geo group the company that owns the prison in tacoma allegedly forced detainees to stand before they entered rooms under threat of punishment including solitary confinement maru mora villalpando local activist and co founder of la resistencia which organizes against the detention center relayed what people inside were telling her we re being given trash to eat and at the same time you have these old trays and the machine doesn t really wash them the entire conditions created a moment where people went on hunger strike mora villalpando said finally because nothing was done things kept being the same way then they went on a hunger strike in the months after an activist was shot and killed outside of the processing center geo group has renamed the facility and started allowing reporters inside for what activists have called a sanitized tour in september a group of journalists were given a tour of the facility one report from q13 saw detention center employees showcasing televisions and computers to the reporter later during the tour detainees were shouting that they were hungry and not being fed around 60 of the people being held at the detention center have been shipped there from the southern border mora villalpando said children are not housed at the center meaning many of the detainees are likely separated from their families there s a lot of people from everywhere mora villalpando said obviously for those that have relatives we get a lot of calls from people outside the state trying to locate their loved ones here access to medical care is also an issue as documented in 2018 by seattle weekly nationwide around 50 000 people are locked away in immigration camps and prisons according to the federal government it s the tip of the spear of a brand of immigration policy that has been enacted by every u s president since bill clinton decided to get tough on immigration in the 1990s public radio international reports that climate change is putting pressure on central and latin america and that a system of borders camps and deportations could be the federal government s response to migrants and refugees in the coming decades predictions climate change in and of itself is only one of the factors that plays into migration kayly ober is a senior advocate for climate displacement at refugees international she said often times climate change is part of the mixture when people decide to move climate change can exacerbate some of the principal factors ober said in syria before its civil war there were issues of poor governance related to water but drought made it worse it s debatable how much the drought was caused by climate change and for that matter how much of the complex social mixture of government repression religious conflict foreign intervention and drought came together to create on of the worst refugee crisis in modern times climate change often acts as an accelerant adding fuel to existing tensions throughout the world and especially in the global south where the effects of a hotter earth will be felt more acutely the world bank in 2018 conducted a study looking at the impacts of climate change on sub saharan africa south asia and latin america the study found that in those three densely populated areas some 140 million people could become refugees many of them would likely be internal refugees moving from low lying areas of their countries that are susceptible to sea level rise for example to other places rural areas will likely become more depopulated as people head toward major cities as climate change destroys crops and makes traditional agricultural livelihoods more difficult to sustain according to the united states agency for international development but in many areas of the world traditional centers of migration like mumbai india may be unlivable closer to the u s hurricanes are likely to begin stalling over caribbean nations for longer periods of time causing more damage ober said this needs to be in the forefront of our minds as those kinds of disasters increase in the near future ober said hurricane dorian in particular stalled over the bahamas for more than 24 hours historically the u s has offered many people displaced by natural disasters temporary protected status or tps the trump administration is trying to revoke tps for hundreds of thousands of people in the country and lawsuits challenging it are ongoing according to media reports there is no special status for people fleeing the effects of climate change and ober said it is unlikely the u s will ever have a special designation or category for climate displaced people what she suggested instead would be a program similar to tps but with a pathway to citizenship local level king county is developing a new five year climate action plan which is designed for communities that will likely bear a disproportionate amount of the impact the county board of health met on nov 21 to discuss the new plan and heard from a panel comprised of people working within communities of color to address climate preparedness one panelist was nourah yonous a somali immigrant who started the organization african women business alliance she works with immigrant women to help grow and stabilize their businesses she said there will likely be an influx of climate migrants coming and that local government could do more in particular communities could use more tools to cope with climate change we are not really well prepared she said of local governments when communities of color aren t being given tangible and culturally responsive tools to address issues like displacement economic injustice or food insecurity government action doesn t lead to communities being more climate resiliant instead it s a bandage she said for that reason i think it s very important for us to know that these issues are connected she said improving public transit building more affordable energy efficient housing increasing solar and wind power and reducing transit fares could all help immigrant communities once they arrive the county will be looking at its climate plan with environmental justice as an integral part instead of an add on it could help climate immigrants and refugees here deal with some of the same issues that perhaps led them to leave countries in the first place in a wider view mora villalpando said the u s should return to immigration laws prior to the clinton crackdown in 1996 clinton signed a harsh immigration bill called the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act which restricted many ways for people to become citizens for example before the bill was signed immigrants who had been in the u s for seven years could get legal status if they showed it would cause extreme hardship to get deported vox reported this practice was ended by clinton this came on the heels of dirty wars and counter insurgency coin operations promoted and conducted u s intelligence agencies in the 1980s operations that destroyed both the governments and the social fabrics of countries throughout latin america this is the argument that investigative journalist and professor christian parenti makes dirty 80s largely left out of political discourse surrounding immigration is one of the key drivers of it u s backed violence during the cold war this ranged from supporting security forces in guatemala as they committed genocide against indigenous mayan peoples to the reagan administration smoothing over u s involvement in massacres across latin america the u s government in its quest

the trump administration is considering lowering taxes on capital gains by using its authority to write internal revenue service irs regulations national economic council director larry kudlow has publicly supported indexing capital gains for inflation for many years indexing would lower the effective tax rates on sales of long term investments such as stocks mutual funds and residences president donald trump has the authority to issue an executive order requiring the treasury department which oversees the irs to change its method of calculation currently capital gains tax rates on investments held for more than one year range from 0 percent for low income individuals to 20 percent for those with taxable income above 434 550 for single persons or 488 850 for married couples most federal income tax filers pay 15 percent for capital gains the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act did not change those rates senate opposition there are various democrat proposals to raise capital gains tax rates on higher income earners and some republicans oppose the trump administration s plan indexing the cost basis for capital gains to inflation would mark a dramatic change in u s tax policy sen mitt romney r ut stated in a letter to mnuchin opposing implementation of indexing through executive order on september 13 not only would such a change stand on dubious constitutional and legal ground it would primarily benefit wealthy investors without supporting american workers romney said senate support many senate republicans have come out in support of the plan sen ted cruz r tx and 20 other republican members of the u s senate sent mnuchin a letter urging him to use his regulatory authority to eliminate inflationary gains from the treasury s calculation of capital gains tax liability on july 29 the united states economy has experienced historic levels of growth as a result of congress and the current administration s policies such as the tax cuts and jobs act the letter states implementing a policy of indexing capital gains to inflation will help to perpetuate these successes by encouraging savings investment and innovation so that everyday americans can continue to enjoy better lives and livelihoods fairness concerns the inflation tax is unfair and recalculating capital gains taxes would encourage economic growth the letter states currently the methodology treasury employs to calculate capital gains ignores gains resulting from inflation and ultimately hampers economic growth cruz wrote when a taxpayer sells a capital asset they pay taxes on their gains the difference between the basis and the sale price under current rules treasury determines the basis by looking at the sticker price at the time of purchase without consideration of the inflation adjusted cost of the asset in today s dollars the current method of calculating capital gains taxes is flawed says kyle pomerlau chief economist and vice president of economic analysis at the tax foundation if an asset appreciates only due to inflation the current method overstates real gains and taxes income that an individual didn t really earn pomerlau said taxing capital losses cruz is right to note the current rules make taxpayers face a tax liability even if they have suffered an actual loss pomerlau says under current law an individual is subject to capital gains tax if they sell an asset that has appreciated in value pomerlau said sometimes however an asset may appreciate in value simply because the general price level has increased not because the asset has increased in value in any real sense if this happens the current tax code could place a positive tax burden on an asset that didn t really generate any income an inflation tax the value of an asset can be inflated by government s devaluation of the dollar to stimulate the economy says economist edward hudgins research director of the heartland institute which publishes budget tax news indexing capital gains taxes to inflation is a minimum that should be in any tax reform package hudgins said indexing blocks the possibility of governments making illicit gains by inflating the currency indeed the irresponsible deficit spending by politicians today is worse than at any time in the country s history with the federal debt as high as annual gnp indexing will protect the wealth of citizens if and when inflation returns the burden of government at all levels is too high says hudgins in spite of the very welcome tax cuts of 2017 americans are still overtaxed income taxes corporate taxes social security taxes local sales and property taxes and yes capital gains taxes hudgins said if the capital gains tax were eliminated entirely it could keep wealth in the hands of individuals and give them strong incentives to invest in productive activities and assets keeping that wealth out of the hands of irresponsible profligate politicians hudgins said calls for more lowering effective tax rates on capital gains wouldn t have much effect says pomerlau i do not think indexing would be significantly pro growth pomerlau said capital gains already receive pretty good tax treatment under current law as a result the effective tax rate on gains is already pretty low adding indexing which isn t a significant tax cut would do little to further reduce the effective tax rate congress and the trump administration should focus on additional tax reforms pomerlau said mainly they should focus on expanding tax preferred savings vehicles like 401ks iras and roth iras pomerlau said these savings vehicles provide an even larger benefit than indexing does and are much less complex to administer than indexing ashley herzog writes from avon lake ohio

how much the drought was caused by climate change and for that matter how much of the complex social mixture of government repression religious conflict foreign intervention and drought came together to create on of the worst refugee crisis in modern times climate change often acts as an accelerant adding fuel to existing tensions throughout the world and especially in the global south where the effects of a hotter earth will be felt more acutely the world bank in 2018 conducted a study looking at the impacts of climate change on sub saharan africa south asia and latin america the study found that in those three densely populated areas some 140 million people could become refugees many of them would likely be internal refugees moving from low lying areas of their countries that are susceptible to sea level rise for example to other places rural areas will likely become more depopulated as people head toward major cities as climate change destroys crops and makes traditional agricultural livelihoods more difficult to sustain according to the united states agency for international development but in many areas of the world traditional centers of migration like mumbai india may be unlivable closer to the u s hurricanes are likely to begin stalling over caribbean nations for longer periods of time causing more damage ober said this needs to be in the forefront of our minds as those kinds of disasters increase in the near future ober said hurricane dorian in particular stalled over the bahamas for more than 24 hours historically the u s has offered many people displaced by natural disasters temporary protected status or tps the trump administration is trying to revoke tps for hundreds of thousands of people in the country and lawsuits challenging it are ongoing according to media reports there is no special status for people fleeing the effects of climate change and ober said it is unlikely the u s will ever have a special designation or category for climate displaced people what she suggested instead would be a program similar to tps but with a pathway to citizenship local level king county is developing a new five year climate action plan which is designed for communities that will likely bear a disproportionate amount of the impact the county board of health met on nov 21 to discuss the new plan and heard from a panel comprised of people working within communities of color to address climate preparedness one panelist was nourah yonous a somali immigrant who started the organization african women business alliance she works with immigrant women to help grow and stabilize their businesses she said there will likely be an influx of climate migrants coming and that local government could do more in particular communities could use more tools to cope with climate change we are not really well prepared she said of local governments when communities of color aren t being given tangible and culturally responsive tools to address issues like displacement economic injustice or food insecurity government action doesn t lead to communities being more climate resiliant instead it s a bandage she said for that reason i think it s very important for us to know that these issues are connected she said improving public transit building more affordable energy efficient housing increasing solar and wind power and reducing transit fares could all help immigrant communities once they arrive the county will be looking at its climate plan with environmental justice as an integral part instead of an add on it could help climate immigrants and refugees here deal with some of the same issues that perhaps led them to leave countries in the first place in a wider view mora villalpando said the u s should return to immigration laws prior to the clinton crackdown in 1996 clinton signed a harsh immigration bill called the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act which restricted many ways for people to become citizens for example before the bill was signed immigrants who had been in the u s for seven years could get legal status if they showed it would cause extreme hardship to get deported vox reported this practice was ended by clinton this came on the heels of dirty wars and counter insurgency coin operations promoted and conducted u s intelligence agencies in the 1980s operations that destroyed both the governments and the social fabrics of countries throughout latin america this is the argument that investigative journalist and professor christian parenti makes dirty 80s largely left out of political discourse surrounding immigration is one of the key drivers of it u s backed violence during the cold war this ranged from supporting security forces in guatemala as they committed genocide against indigenous mayan peoples to the reagan administration smoothing over u s involvement in massacres across latin america the u s government in its quest against communism decided to back dictators in chile argentina peru el salvador nicaragua guatemala uruguay and more many of these regimes committed human rights abuses for example the u s backed the right wing military government in el salvador which left 75 000 dead in 2009 the obama administration and hillary clinton supported a coup in honduras that destabilized the country the u s also conducted or promoted counter insurgency coin operations these operations are distinct from traditional warfare parenti said whereas traditional warfare focuses on capturing and controlling territory counter insurgency relies on prying insurgents from their support base this results often in the destruction of traditional societal ties breaking apart countries following decades of intervention much of latin america was left with weakened governments a fragmented society and a power vacuum that allowed gangs and narcotics trafficking to set up shop the u s proxy wars in central america in the 1980s were really damaging to the social fabric because those were counter insurgency conflicts parenti said the counter insurgency in central america in the 1980s seeded the region with a kind of trauma that kind of shows up as astonishing levels of violence this was something mora villalpando also talked about countries currently experiencing upheaval in latin america have generally experienced either u s backed violence or have been stricken by international monetary fund austerity and have been pressured to cut social safety nets and services it is important to realize that when people complain about migration there s a lot to blame to the united states government in creating the conditions in the first place and forcing us to migrate mora villalpando said mora villalpando who herself is undocumented said she left mexico in the 1990s before nafta was signed the free trade agreement flooded the country with cheap international goods forcing local producers and farmers out of the market and often into poverty parenti reports that all this sets the stage for even greater effects from climate change as weakened governments are less likely to be able to respond to natural and economic disasters mora villalpando said migration is likely to continue along the southern border and even increase in coming decades as climate change affects them more severely than countries in the global north the impact is not going to be on those nations it s going to be on the global south they don t have any other recourse mora villalpando said migration will explode in numbers divorced from its historical roots more people seeking refuge in the u s provides ample political fodder for nationalist rhetoric in the u s every u s president since clinton has deported hundreds of thousands of people climate change and the armed lifeboat in the 1970s ecologist garrett hardin developed an anti immigration strain of political reasoning it goes something like this say there s a lifeboat with room for five but there s 20 passengers in the water what should be done hardin argued that if all the people come onto the lifeboat everyone dies resources should be protected even at the expense of others this is the type of thinking that parenti argues governments seem to be adopting in the global north from european countries building fences to keep out syrian refugees to u s presidents including obama and trump appeasing nationalist sentiments to more heavily enforce the southern border countries around the world are sending a message to current and future refugees and migrants parenti doesn t think it s necessarily an organized response to climate change but may set a precedent for how the u s could respond as climate change leads to increased immigration the u s military has been preparing for climate destabilization since at least 2004 according to the guardian even as politicans tried to cast doubt on the scientific consensus that climate change is happening immigrant workers can benefit the economy parenti said but currently undocumented workers face a number of hurdles and are more vulnerable to exploitation increasing rights for immigrants and workers could help combat the idea of the armed lifeboat to have a section of the working class that is without legal rights and is terrified and will not join unions that harms the entire working population parenti said so people need to realize that it is in their immediate and direct economic self interest to make sure that immigrant workers have the right to struggle for their rights as workers granting more protection to immigrants climate driven or otherwise would help give people power parenti said if employers couldn t pay a segment of undocumented workers less than natural born workers more legal protection would raise wages for everyone parenti said he s also in favor of a green new deal and buying into green technology while removing subsidies for the fossil fuel industry jobs packages have been a topic in green new deal discussions as has the idea of medicare for all which could help soften the blows from climate change for everyone ultimately though americans could have a choice continue with business as usual or find new ways to handle migrants and refugees as climate change and the legacy of u s cold war policy affect their neighbors to the south for us it s very important to explain that what the current administration s policy is doing is the same mora villalpando said it s just 10 times bigger
washington president donald trump said he would impose tariffs effective immediately on all steel and aluminum shipped into the united states from brazil and argentina brazil and argentina have been presiding over a massive devaluation of their currencies which is not good for our farmers trump said in monday morning tweet he then directed his attention to the federal reserve saying the central bank should act so that countries of which there are many no longer take advantage of our strong dollar by further devaluing their currencies this makes it very hard for our farmers to fairly export their goods lower rates loosen fed the surprise announcement came after it appeared as though the white house was preparing to dial back its adversarial trade approach in the lead up to next year s election the administration appeared close to a deal with house democrats to revamp the north american free trade agreement and tensions with china had eased in recent weeks the tariffs took aim at one of the most vital industries in brazil at a particularly vulnerable moment unemployment is above 10 percent and the economy has stalled the steel industry long one of the nation s economic engines has been looking increasingly wobbly as well slashing growth projections earlier this year brazilian steel exports to the u s accounted for roughly 2 6 billion last year making the united states one of brazil s biggest markets for steel and analysts expected the tariffs to be painful in argentina where steel and aluminum exports represent roughly 700 million the unexpected news comes as the nation is undergoing a transition of power if the tariffs persist they will be one of the earliest diplomatic tests to face the incoming presidency of alberto fernández a leftist politician who will take office within a week argentina s troubles have affected brazil s economy though it s unclear what actions triggered the announcement from trump advertisement in brazil the tariffs announcement stunned officials who for nearly a year have sought to develop closer ties with the united states particularly brazilian president jair bolsonaro nicknamed by some as the trump of the tropics bolsonaro has repeatedly praised trump mimicked his rhetoric and even tried to install his son as the ambassador to the united states but on monday bolsonaro appeared taken by surprise i m going to speak with paulo guedes he told several reporters outside the presidential palace referring to the country s finance minister aluminum i m going to speak with paulo guedes now if necessary i ll call trump i have an open channel with him trump s tweets also referenced wall street s gains u s markets are up as much as 21 since the announcement of tariffs on 3 1 2018 he wrote suggesting he s not too concerned about a market blowback if he ratchets up trade tensions david wessel director of the hutchins center on fiscal and monetary policy at the brookings institution said the markets have been hopeful that the trade war may soon end making the timing of trump s announcement all the more surprising rattling the trade war saber which may play well with his base seems to me like it is likely to hurt the markets wessel said advertisement by midmorning monday the major u s indexes were in negative territory the dow jones industrial average was off roughly 0 5 percent the standard poor s 500 was 0 7 percent in the red and the nasdaq composite was down roughly 1 2 percent trump also appeared to push for a two pronged approach to weakening the u s dollar through action by the fed and by dealing hits to foreign countries the president doesn t seem to see any contradiction between his frequent assertions that the u s is the strongest economy in the world and his insistence that in such circumstances the u s dollar should be going down wessel said the treasury department twice each year issues a report that looks at the currency policies of all major economies to determine whether any nation is improperly manipulating its currency this is at least the second time that trump has made a declaration about another nation s policies that did not mesh with his own treasury department s formal assessment in august he declared that china had been manipulating its currency forcing treasury secretary steven mnuchin to scramble and assert the same even though treasury had not found china to be manipulating its currency in its official evaluation and in the latest report released in may treasury did not allege brazil or argentina had done anything improper in handling their currencies instead that report said that the u s dollar had strengthened against the currencies of brazil and india as external pressures on many emerging markets intensified in the midst of crises in argentina and turkey monday s directive marks the latest twist in trump s trade war which has become a major fixture of his foreign and economic policies trump has said he looked to clinch a trade deal with china this year but those talks have unraveled on multiple occasions trump is now focused on a partial trade deal which he has referred to as phase one and which would include large purchases of u s farm products by beijing the next potential deadline that could bring the united states and china to the table comes dec 15 when trump s next round of tariffs is scheduled to affect about 160 billion in chinese goods a deal could make those levies disappear according to sources familiar with the talks earlier in trump s presidency in march 2018 top steel suppliers including brazil south korea and japan complained that the office of the u s trade representative had yet to establish a process for countries to apply for tariff exemptions just days before tariffs on foreign made steel and aluminum were scheduled to take effect at the time brazil was the no 2 steel supplier to the united states in 2017 the u s imported 34 6 million metric tons of steel from 85 countries advertisement trump imposed the steel and aluminum tariffs after his commerce department found that the large amount of these imports posed a threat to the national security of the united states trump has tried to use these and other tariffs as leverage against other countries to change their trade policies with mixed success in june trump threatened to impose tariffs on mexican goods and even shut down the u s border if more wasn t done to crack down on migrant crossings this did prompt mexico to negotiate and make some changes a response white house officials felt validated the hardball tactics initially the steel and aluminum tariffs trump imposed seemed to lead to a brief revival of the domestic steel industry leading companies to expand hiring as prices increased but there are signs that this renaissance was short lived and some plants have begun cutting workers amid a slump in stock values and steel prices trump and bolsonaro have shared a particular bond that spans their shared antagonism of the news media to massive fires in the amazon rainforest recently trump pledged to take brazil s side as bolsonaro said the powerful group of seven countries were criticizing his government s response to the fires when french president emmanuel macron announced in august that g 7 member nations had approved a 22 million emergency aid package to help combat the fires the trump administration did not give its support saying that any solution should be done in consultation with brazil trump later praised bolsonaro for working very hard on the amazon fires and in all respects doing a great job for the people of brazil the washington post s david j lynch and david nakamura contributed to this report send questions comments to the editors previous next
limit new notes to big transactions economists advise bog charles benoni okine suleiman mustapha business news dec 02 2019 08 21 economic experts have cautioned the bank of ghana bog to ensure that the introduction of the new cedi denominations into the economy will not affect the current volume of money in circulation subsequently they have advised the central bank to do all within its remit to limit the supply of the higher currency banknotes and restrict its access to big ticket businesses and transactions in a bid to contain any inflationary pressures the introduction could bring to the economy in separate interviews with the daily graphic in response to the introduction of the gh 200 and gh 100 banknotes in particular the economists also called for intensified public education to erase the misconceptions about the action of the bog and prevent the public from losing confidence in the local currency because of the introduction of the new denominations the economists were of the view that should the public lose confidence in the local currency their only option would be to take refuge in foreign currencies a development which would cause the cedi to depreciate further although they welcomed the introduction of the banknotes by the bog they advised against any move that would create problems for the economy in the short to medium term their views were among many that the daily graphic sought following the introduction of the new banknotes and a coin which will be in circulation from today other views are from the ghana union of traders associations guta students and traders at makola and osu in accra the guta president dr joseph obeng also urged the bog to manage speculations about the negative impact of the new denominations and encourage people to use them extra caution a senior economist at databank mr courage martey said if the higher denominations were limited to the payment of only big ticket transactions it would help curb the attendant challenge of inflation i think the central bank needs to be extra cautious on how it intends to introduce the higher denominations in terms of how widely it circulates them i expect the higher denominations to be very limited in supply and circulation he added intensify education the director of the institute of statistical social and economic research isser of the university of ghana

misconceptions among the public about the new denominations could easily invalidate the rationale for the move by the central bank and create disruptions in the economy inflation expectation prof quartey said one of the key issues the bog had to manage was the impact of the new denominations on inflation according to him if the introduction of the higher banknotes increased money in circulation it would have a telling impact on inflation presently the speculation is that the introduction of the new currencies and a coin amounts to the printing of more money to improve liquidity in the system prof quartey described that speculation as dangerous and urged the central bank to act swiftly to disabuse that notion unless the new denominations were truly meant to increase money supply depreciation the director of isser said the new denominations if not managed properly could lead to a depreciation of the local currency we need to ensure that people do not lose confidence in the currency and attempt to take solace in other stable ones such as the united states dollar and the british pound or even the euro if that happens it will put pressure on the cedi to depreciate further he said he said when people felt any inflationary pressure their last option was to cushion themselves by acquiring more predictable and stable currencies a development he believed could

denominations into the country s currency mix saying it would improve security in business transactions reports timothy ngnenbe the guta president dr obeng said the gh 200 and gh 100 banknotes would make transactions easier because they came in handy and addressed the challenge of carrying bulky amounts of money he however said efforts must be made by managers of the economy to strengthen the local currency against other foreign currencies the underlying thing is for the managers of the economy to do everything possible to improve and sustain the value of the cedi it is good that higher denominations have been introduced to boost the security of transactions but we cannot continue to increase denominations if we are not able to sustain the value of our currency he said dr obeng also called for more work to be done to promote a cashless economy which he said was more secure and efficient given that the world was fast digitising he dismissed the assertion that the introduction of the two larger denominations could lead to inflation saying that the introduction has no bearing on inflation random views some individuals in accra and osu who spoke to the daily graphic expressed displeasure with the bog for introducing the higher denominations reports joshua bediako koomson some claimed it would rather worsen the economy saying traders would have to go round to find change

up to gh 200 saying getting change for her customers who presented the higher notes to buy things would be very difficult with that i may be forced to give back his or her to him or her if i meet five of such buyers in a day it means i ve lost five customers i believe these denominations will rather bring challenges to petty traders like me she said a lotto agent who gave his name as boniface

when investors look at public markets today many see high current valuations low expected returns and a likelihood of increased volatility against this backdrop it s little surprise that more than a few are increasing their focus on private markets and on private equity pe specifically their interest is amplified by a shift in the public private balance of company ownership with more companies going private or staying private for longer allocators who want to be invested in growth over the next decade have even more reason to consider private equity there are several ways for institutional investors to access private equity today the traditional route of gp lp structures co investments alongside those structures secondary markets and direct flexible hold strategies this ii interview with konnin tam managing director and co head of secondaries and liquidity solutions at blackrock private equity partners is one of a three part series on creating persistent alpha in private equity and is focused on private equity secondaries which involve the sale and purchase of investors existing interests in pe funds and portfolios a lot of people are concerned that we re late in the economic cycle how does this affect the market for secondaries i think you need to consider the effects on both the supply and the demand side on the supply side we think the belief that we re late in the cycle is prompting pe investors to consider repositioning their portfolios in advance of the next downturn so we re seeing an increasing number of sellers that are motivated by either a desire to lock in what they view as attractive underlying fund valuations or by a desire to generate some liquidity to reinvest into other opportunities in pe or in different asset classes on the demand side we think that buyers are more consciously factoring late cycle dynamics into their asset selection underwriting and structuring so we re seeing greater interest in less levered and higher growth assets as well as in assets that have more flexible debt packages or that offer greater secondary market discounts blackrock when you consider the environment from the perspective of both buyers and sellers it makes sense that this is shaping up to be a record year in terms of secondary market volume if you believe that we re late in the cycle then it may be prudent to pare back or reposition your portfolio at the same time if you are an informed buyer and can properly navigate the environment there are opportunities to take advantage of the supply that is coming to market to acquire assets with counter cyclical properties we ve seen tremendous growth in sponsor led secondaries in recent years what are the biggest challenges and opportunities in investing in these deals in a sponsor led secondary which can be defined as one in which the pe manager is partnering with a secondary buyer to offer liquidity for some part of an existing pe portfolio there are several unique challenges i think the biggest ones revolve around transparency and alignment of interests among stakeholders the rationale for the manager doing a sponsor led deal needs to stand up for their investors to be supportive of the deal there also needs to be a true status quo option for existing investors meaning that they re not forced to sell if they don t want to ultimately successful sponsor led secondaries need to benefit the sellers the buyers and the pe manager and that makes these transactions quite complex but it can also create interesting opportunities for buyers and for pe firms that can craft an aligned solution because of that increased transactional complexity we believe the market is underwriting such sponsor led secondaries at a higher level than traditional secondaries in addition to that complexity premium sponsor led secondaries often carry a unique opportunity from a portfolio construction perspective sponsor led deals by their nature tend to be more concentrated than highly diversified portfolio deals so buyers may be able to fill in gaps in certain areas of a pe portfolio such as strategy industry or geography what is the role of secondaries in investors portfolios and how has that changed in recent years it used to be that secondaries were primarily used by investors that were new to private equity as a means to get invested quickly in a risk mitigated and diversified way by purchasing a shorter duration highly diversified portfolio in the secondary market it s possible to get immediate vintage year diversification with exposure to a number of managers across different strategies geographies and industries while these new entrants to private equity continue to play a role in driving capital into the market we now also see seasoned pe investors maintaining or in some cases increasing their allocations to secondaries i ve talked about secondaries as a counter cyclical and opportunistic strategy i think seasoned investors are maintaining an allocation partly because of those characteristics we also think that an allocation to secondaries adds resilience to private equity and private markets portfolios due to the benefits of additional diversification and the ability to price in more factors in a partly funded portfolio among other factors because of these potential benefits we do think more and more private equity investors consider secondaries to be an integral and consistent part of their pe portfolios the way the secondary market has evolved over the years is analogous to the way the broad pe market has evolved private equity used to be seen as an alternative investment now it s a core one for many institutional investors and secondaries used to be considered a niche part of the pe market but now they are a core holding for many pe investors as the sheer size of the market expands and secondaries become a regularly accepted portfolio management tool on both the buy side and the sell side how do you see the secondaries market evolving in the future in a little over a decade we ve seen the market evolve from just single or multi fund portfolio transfers to encompass dozens of different kinds of transactions including sponsor led deals team and portfolio spinouts and carveouts real asset secondaries private credit portfolios preferred equity and synthetic secondaries which replicate the economic outcome of a secondary transaction without actually transferring the underlying fund portfolios so there s been a great deal of innovation in the market in a relatively short amount of time really in response to the dynamic and complex asset class that is global private equity we expect that to continue and we believe that market participants will continue to develop new transaction types to address new needs and opportunities we also think market transparency and the speed of execution will continue to evolve and improve but inefficiencies will persist as well i think one area where we ll see a good deal of innovation is in the quality of the analytics we think of the secondaries market as data rich but analytics poor so we believe it s ripe for future advancements in
