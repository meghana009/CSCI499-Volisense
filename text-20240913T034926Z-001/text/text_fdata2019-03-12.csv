4q2018 energy generation decreased 14 to 3 471 gwh as compared to 4 039 gwh during the same period of 2017 see section c main operating metrics mainly due to a 44 decrease in the hydro generation explained by the decision from cammesa to increase the water reserves for 2019 s summer months and a reduction in the waterflow from the limay and collón curá rivers adjusted ebitda increased to ps 31 989 million in 2018 a 461 increase compared to ps 5 705 million in 2017 see section d financial adjusted ebitda excluding cvosa effect and fx differences and interest on foni receivables increased to

the development of our expansion plans to increase our installed capacity from both renewable and conventional sources this shows the strong commitment of central puerto which even in a complex economic context focuses in the future consolidating itself as one of the leaders of the market providing solutions to the energy requirements of argentina jorge rauber ceo central puerto res se 70 2018 on november 7 2018 the secretariat of energy issued res 70 2018 which authorized generators to procure their own fuel for assets under the energía base regulatory framework if generation companies opt to take this option cammessa will value and pay the generators their respective fuel costs in accordance with the variable costs of production cvp declared by each generator to cammesa according to cammesa s procedure the machines with the lower cvps are dispatched first and consequently may produce more electric energy the agency in charge of dispatch organismo encargado del despacho or oed using the spanish acronym cammesa will continue to supply the fuel for those generation companies that do not take this option application of ias 29 given that argentina s accumulated triennial inflation either calculated based on the wholesale price index or the consumer price index is currently over 100 and the revised targets of the national government and other available projections indicate that this trend will not reverse in the short term the argentine economy is currently considered hyperinflationary under ias 29 under ias 29 entities that must prepare their financial statements pursuant to ifrs and whose functional currency is the argentine peso such as central puerto must restate their financial statements relating to annual or intermediate periods such restatement must take place as if the economy had always been hyperinflationary using a general price index that reflects changes in the purchasing power of the currency accordingly the financial statements have been stated in terms of the measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period including the corresponding financial figures for previous periods informed for comparative purposes b recent news purchase of brigadier lópez plant on february 27 central puerto was awarded the brigadier lópez plant in the auction conducted by integración energética argentina s a ieasa the plant currently operates with a gas turbine 280 mw in an open cycle configuration and is currently in advance stages to add a steam turbine in a combined cycle configuration which will add 140 mw once completed the combined cycle will increase its efficiency significantly becoming one of the most efficient combined cycle of argentina in terms of heat rate approximately 1 485 kcal kwh according to cammesa s estimations the power capacity and the energy produced will be taken by cammesa under ppa agreements the price offered for the transaction was us 165 million from which us 155 million will be paid in cash and us 10 million will be settled with the transfer of trade receivables owed to the company by cammesa lvfvd accrued under the res se 95 13 regulatory framework central puerto will also assume us 161 million in debt to be paid in 41 monthly equal installments starting on april 2019 and accruing a 6 months libor 5 variable or 6 25 fixed interest rate the highest the plant is expected to be transferred effectively on april 1 2019 new regulatory framework for energía base units on march 1 2019 the secretariat of renewable resources and electric market issued res 1 2019 which replaces the tariff scheme for the energía base energy generation units the table below sets forth the tariffs to be applied starting on march 2019 by source of generation items thermal hydro power capacity payments res 1 191 up to us 7 000 per mw per month during december january february june july and august up to us 5 500 per mw per month during march april may september october and

availability weighted average by power capacity off time due to scheduled maintenance agreed with cammesa is not included in the ratio in 4q2018 energy generation from continuing operations decreased 14 to 4 422 gwh compared to 4q2017 mainly due to a 44 decrease in the hydro generation explained by the decision from cammesa to increase the water reserves for 2019 s summer months and reduction in the waterflow from the limay and collón curá rivers while thermal production in the period decreased 2 this decrease was partially offset by the increase in energy generation from the wind farms achiras i and la castellana i which started operations on the 3q2018 during 4q2018 machine availability of thermal units was 94 compared to 91 in 4q2017 showing a sustained level and well above the market average availability for thermal units for the same period of 79 according to data from cammesa finally steam production showed a 11 decrease totaling 256 000 tons produced during 4q2018 compared to 289 000 tons during the 4q2017 due to less demand by our client during 2018 energy generation from continuing operations decreased 7 to 14 479 gwh compared to 2017 affected by a 16 decrease in thermal generation mainly due to scheduled maintenance in the puerto combined cycle plant during 2q2018 the temporary impact on thermal production was partially offset by a 13 increase in hydro generation due to greater water flow and the increase in energy production due to the star of operations of achiras i and la castellana i during 2018 machine availability of thermal units was 89 compared to 90 in 2017 mainly due to the above mentioned extension unscheduled of the maintenance of the puerto combined cycle plant nonetheless central puerto s availability was higher than the market average of 79 for the same period according to data from cammesa finally during 2018 steam production decreased 6 to 1 103 000 tons compared to 1 178 000 during the same period of 2017 due to less demand by our client renewable energy during 3q2018 la castellana i 99 mw and achiras i 48 mw wind farms commenced their commercial operations these plants generated and sold under the renovar

related to foni trade receivables 11 927 205 13 564 2018 results analysis revenues from continuing operations increased 48 to ps 14 265 million in the 2018 as compared to ps 9 639 million in 2017 the increase in revenues was mainly driven by i the tariff increase established by res 19 17 which set higher prices for energy generation and machine availability and set them in us dollars 2018 was fully impacted by the november 2017 tariff increase ii an increase in the exchange rate for 2018 higher than the inflation for the period which impacted tariffs set in us dollars in terms of argentine pesos current at the end of the reporting period as a reference during 2018 the foreign exchange rate increased 102 2 and inflation rate was 47 6 while during 2017 the foreign exchange rate increased 17 4 and the inflation rate was 24 8 and iii the price for the self supplied fuel recognized by cammesa in accordance to res 70 18 for the natural gas used during november and december 2018 in some of the units under the energía base regulatory framework which amounted ps 2 129 million this was partially offset by a 7 decrease in energy generation from continuing operations that totaled 14 479 gwh during 2018 and less availability from our thermal units during 2018 mainly because of the scheduled maintenance of the puerto combined cycle plant the table below sets forth the tariff scheme for energía base which was effective between november 2017 and february 2019 by source of generation thermal hydro capacity payments res 19 171 up to us 7 000 per mw per month us 3 000 per mw per month

availability of each unit and the achievement of the guaranteed bid capacity digo in spanish that each generator may send to cammesa twice a year for further details see item 4 b business overview the argentine electric power sector remuneration scheme the current remuneration scheme in the annual report on form 20 f filed with the sec on april 27 2018 gross profit increased 75 to ps 7 779 million compared to ps 4 439 million in 2017 this increase was due to i the above mentioned increase in revenues and ii a less than proportional increase in costs of sales that totaled ps 6 487 million a 25 increase as compared to ps 5 199 million in 2017 the increase in the cost of sales was primarily driven by i the cost of the self supplied fuel purchased in accordance to res 70 18 described above for around ps 1 9 billion iv a higher cost of natural gas for the units that generate steam or electric energy under the energía plus framework mainly due an increase in the exchange rate for 2018 that was higher than the inflation for the period which impacted in the us dollars denominated price of natural gas in terms of argentine pesos current at the end of the reporting period as a reference during 2018 the foreign exchange rate increased 102 2 and inflation rate was 47 6 while during 2017 the foreign exchange rate increased 17 4 and the inflation rate was 24 8 this was partially offset by lower prices in us dollars this was partially offset by a 7 8 decrease in the non fuel related costs of production mainly due to i a 7 decrease in energy generation which resulted in a decrease of ps 119 million in maintenance costs a ps 59 million decrease in depreciation and a ps 23 million decrease in consumption of materials and spare parts ii a decrease in ps 82 million decrease in the purchase of energy and power iii lower than inflation increases in costs such as compensation to employees and other long term employee benefits as a consequence gross profit margin increased 8 5 p p reaching 55 in 2018 operating income before other operating results net increased 89 to ps 6 389 million compared to ps 3 383 million in 2017 this increase was due to i the above mentioned increase in gross profits and ii a less than proportional increase in administrative and selling expenses that totaled ps 1 389 million a 32 increase as compared to ps 1 056 million in 2017 this increase was mainly driven by i a 86 increase in taxes on bank account transactions due to increased revenues costs and capital expenditures completed during the period ii a 270 increase in maintenance expenses mainly as a result of civil works conducted on the office buildings conducted during 2018 and ii a 26 increase in fees and compensation for professional services due to legal and financial advisory and consultancy services used during the period adjusted ebitda increased to ps 31 989 million in 2018 compared to ps 5 705 million in 2017 this exceptionally high increase was driven by i the increase in operating results before other operating income net mentioned above ii a ps 11 017 million during the 2018 from a one time gain from the cvo commercial operation approval the cvo effect and iii ps 13 953 million during the 2018 from the foreign exchange difference and interest accrued on the trade receivables denominated in us dollars mainly from foni trade receivables net income increased to ps 17 185 million or ps 11 64 per share in 2018 compared to ps 5 262 million or ps 3 52 per share in 2017 in addition to the above mentioned factors net income was i negatively impacted by higher financial expenses that amounted to ps 6 301 million in 2018 compared to ps 1201 million in 2017 and ii positively impacted by higher financial income which amounted to ps 2 280 million during 2018 compared to ps 1 559 million in 2017 in each case under i and ii mainly due to the foreign exchange difference over us dollar denominated debt and financial assets which excludes foni and other trade receivables additionally during 2018 the results from discontinued operation decreased to ps 276 million during 2018 compared to ps 791 million in 2017 and the results from the share of profit of associates decreased to ps 1 074 million in 2018 as compared to ps 1 173 million in 2017 mainly due to an extraordinary gain from tgm registered in 2017 partially offset by better results from the operations of ecogas finally results from exposure to the change in the purchasing power of the currency totaled ps 4 036 196 million in 2018 as compared to ps 151 million in 2017 foni collections increased to ps 654 million in 2018 compared to ps 573 million in 2017 both including vat equivalent to approximately us 17 million and us 15 million respectively at the exchange rate as of december 31 2018 in both cases associated to the foni trade receivables for san martín and manuel belgrano plants as for the trade receivables associated with the cvo agreement all the

4q2018 energy generation decreased 14 to 3 471 gwh as compared to 4 039 gwh during the same period of 2017 see section c main operating metrics mainly due to a 44 decrease in the hydro generation explained by the decision from cammesa to increase the water reserves for 2019 s summer months and a reduction in the waterflow from the limay and collón curá rivers adjusted ebitda increased to ps 31

the development of our expansion plans to increase our installed capacity from both renewable and conventional sources this shows the strong commitment of central puerto which even in a complex economic context focuses in the future consolidating itself as one of the leaders of the market providing solutions to the energy requirements of argentina jorge rauber ceo central puerto res se 70 2018 on november 7 2018 the secretariat of energy issued res 70 2018 which authorized generators to procure their own fuel for assets under the energía base regulatory framework if generation companies opt to take this option cammessa will value and pay the generators their respective fuel costs in accordance with the variable costs of production cvp declared by each generator to cammesa according to cammesa s procedure the machines with the lower cvps are dispatched first and consequently may produce more electric energy the agency in charge of dispatch organismo encargado del despacho or oed using the spanish acronym cammesa will continue to supply the fuel for those generation companies that do not take this option application of ias 29 given that argentina s accumulated triennial inflation either calculated based on the wholesale price index or the consumer price index is currently over 100 and the revised targets of the national government and other available projections indicate that this trend will not reverse in the short term the argentine economy is currently considered hyperinflationary under ias 29 under ias 29 entities that must prepare their financial statements pursuant to ifrs and whose functional currency is the argentine peso such as central puerto must restate their financial statements relating to annual or intermediate periods such restatement must take place as if the economy had always been hyperinflationary using a general price index that reflects changes in the purchasing power of the currency accordingly the financial statements have been stated in terms of the measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period including the corresponding financial figures for previous periods informed for comparative purposes b recent news purchase of brigadier lópez plant on february 27 central puerto was awarded the brigadier lópez plant in the auction conducted by integración energética argentina s a ieasa the plant currently operates with a gas turbine 280 mw in an open cycle configuration and is currently in advance stages to add a steam turbine in a combined cycle configuration which will add 140 mw once completed the combined cycle will increase its efficiency significantly becoming one of the most efficient combined cycle of argentina in terms of heat rate approximately 1 485 kcal kwh according to cammesa s estimations the power capacity and the energy produced will be taken by cammesa under ppa agreements the price offered for the transaction was us 165 million from which us 155 million will be paid in cash and us 10 million will be settled with the transfer of trade receivables owed to the company by cammesa lvfvd accrued under the res se 95 13 regulatory framework central puerto will also assume us 161 million in debt to be paid in 41 monthly equal installments starting on april 2019 and accruing a 6 months libor 5 variable or 6 25 fixed interest rate the highest the plant is expected to be transferred effectively on april 1 2019 new regulatory framework for energía base units on march 1 2019 the secretariat of renewable resources and electric market issued res 1 2019

availability weighted average by power capacity off time due to scheduled maintenance agreed with cammesa is not included in the ratio in 4q2018 energy generation from continuing operations decreased 14 to 4 422 gwh compared to 4q2017 mainly due to a 44 decrease in the hydro generation explained by the decision from cammesa to increase the water reserves for 2019 s summer months and reduction in the waterflow from the limay and collón curá rivers while thermal production in the period decreased 2 this decrease was partially offset by the increase in energy generation from the wind farms achiras i and la castellana i which started operations on the 3q2018 during 4q2018 machine availability of thermal units was 94 compared to 91 in 4q2017 showing a sustained level and well above the market average availability for thermal units for the same period of 79 according to data from cammesa finally steam production showed a 11 decrease totaling 256 000 tons produced during 4q2018 compared to 289 000 tons during the 4q2017 due to less demand by our client during 2018 energy generation from continuing operations decreased 7 to 14 479 gwh compared to 2017 affected by a 16 decrease in thermal generation mainly due to scheduled maintenance in the puerto combined cycle plant during 2q2018 the temporary impact on thermal production was partially offset by a 13 increase in hydro generation due to greater water flow and the increase in energy production due to the star of operations of achiras i and la castellana i during 2018 machine availability of thermal units was 89 compared to 90 in 2017 mainly due to the above mentioned extension unscheduled of the maintenance of the puerto combined cycle plant nonetheless central puerto s availability was higher than the market average of 79 for the same period according to data from cammesa finally during 2018 steam production decreased 6 to 1 103 000 tons compared to 1 178 000 during the same period of 2017 due to less demand by our client renewable energy during 3q2018 la castellana i 99 mw and achiras i 48 mw wind farms commenced their commercial operations these plants generated and sold under the renovar

related to foni trade receivables 11 927 205 13 564 2018 results analysis revenues from continuing operations increased 48 to ps 14 265 million in the 2018 as compared to ps 9 639 million in 2017 the increase in revenues was mainly driven by i the tariff increase established by res 19 17 which set higher prices for energy generation and machine availability and set them in us dollars 2018 was fully impacted by the november 2017 tariff increase ii an increase in the exchange rate for 2018 higher than the inflation for the period which impacted tariffs set in us dollars in terms of argentine pesos current at the end of the reporting period as a reference during 2018 the foreign exchange rate increased 102 2 and inflation rate was 47 6 while during 2017 the foreign exchange rate increased 17 4 and the inflation rate was 24 8 and iii the price for the self supplied fuel recognized by cammesa in accordance to res 70 18 for the natural gas used during november and december 2018 in some of the units under the energía base regulatory framework which amounted ps 2 129 million this was partially offset by a 7 decrease in energy generation from continuing operations that totaled 14 479 gwh during 2018 and less availability from our thermal units during 2018 mainly because of the scheduled maintenance of the puerto combined cycle plant the table below sets forth the tariff scheme for energía base which was effective between november 2017 and february 2019 by source of generation thermal hydro capacity payments res 19 171 up to us 7 000 per mw per month us 3 000 per mw per month

availability of each unit and the achievement of the guaranteed bid capacity digo in spanish that each generator may send to cammesa twice a year for further details see item 4 b business overview the argentine electric power sector remuneration scheme the current remuneration scheme in the annual report on form 20 f filed with the sec on april 27 2018 gross profit increased 75 to ps 7 779 million compared to ps 4 439 million in 2017 this increase was due to i the above mentioned increase in revenues and ii a less than proportional increase in costs of sales that totaled ps 6 487 million a 25 increase as compared to ps 5 199 million in 2017 the increase in the cost of sales was primarily driven by i the cost of the self supplied fuel purchased in accordance to res 70 18 described above for around ps 1 9 billion iv a higher cost of natural gas for the units that generate steam or electric energy under the energía plus framework mainly due an increase in the exchange rate for 2018 that was higher than the inflation for the period which impacted in the us dollars denominated price of natural gas in terms of argentine pesos current at the end of the reporting period as a reference during 2018 the foreign exchange rate increased 102 2 and inflation rate was 47 6 while during 2017 the foreign exchange rate increased 17 4 and the inflation rate was 24 8 this was partially offset by lower prices in us dollars this was partially offset by a 7 8 decrease in the non fuel related costs of production mainly due to i a 7 decrease in energy generation which resulted in a decrease of ps 119 million in maintenance costs a ps 59 million decrease in depreciation and a ps 23 million decrease in consumption of materials and spare parts ii a decrease in ps 82 million decrease in the purchase of energy and power iii lower than inflation increases in costs such as compensation to employees and other long term employee benefits as a consequence gross profit margin increased 8 5 p p reaching 55 in 2018 operating income before other operating results net increased 89 to ps 6 389 million compared to ps 3 383 million in 2017 this increase was due to i the above mentioned increase in gross profits and ii a less than proportional increase in administrative and selling expenses that totaled ps 1 389 million a 32 increase as compared to ps 1 056 million in 2017 this increase was mainly driven by i a 86 increase in taxes on bank account transactions due to increased revenues costs and capital expenditures completed during the period ii a 270 increase in maintenance expenses mainly as a result of civil works conducted on the office buildings conducted during 2018 and ii a 26 increase in fees and compensation for professional services due to legal and financial advisory and consultancy services used during the period adjusted ebitda increased to ps 31 989 million in 2018 compared to ps 5 705 million in 2017 this exceptionally high increase was driven by i the increase in operating results before other operating income net mentioned above ii a ps 11 017 million during the 2018 from a one time gain from the cvo commercial operation approval the cvo effect and iii ps 13 953 million during the 2018 from the foreign exchange difference and interest accrued on the trade receivables denominated in us dollars mainly from foni trade receivables net income increased to ps 17 185 million or ps 11 64 per share in 2018 compared to ps 5 262 million or ps 3 52 per share in 2017 in addition to the above mentioned factors net income was i negatively impacted by higher financial expenses that amounted to ps 6 301 million in 2018 compared to ps 1201 million in 2017 and ii positively impacted by higher financial income which amounted to ps 2 280 million during 2018 compared to ps 1 559 million in 2017 in each case under i and ii mainly due to the foreign exchange difference over us dollar denominated debt and financial assets which excludes foni and other trade receivables additionally during 2018 the results from discontinued operation decreased to ps 276 million during 2018 compared to ps 791 million in 2017 and the results from the share of profit of associates decreased to ps 1 074 million in 2018 as compared to ps 1 173 million in 2017 mainly due to an extraordinary gain from tgm registered in 2017 partially offset by better results from the operations of ecogas finally results from exposure to the change in the purchasing power of the currency totaled ps 4 036 196 million in 2018 as compared to ps 151 million in 2017 foni collections increased to ps 654 million in 2018 compared to ps 573 million in 2017 both including vat equivalent to approximately us 17 million and us 15 million respectively at the exchange rate as of december 31 2018 in both cases associated to the foni trade receivables for san martín and manuel belgrano plants as for the trade receivables associated with the cvo agreement all the

a non ifrs financial measure is defined as net income for the year plus finance expenses minus finance income minus share of the profit of associates minus depreciation and amortization plus income tax expense plus depreciation and amortization minus net results of discontinued operations adjusted ebitda is believed to provide useful supplemental information to investors about the company and its results adjusted ebitda is among the measures used by the company s management team to evaluate the financial and operating performance and make day to day financial and operating decisions in addition adjusted ebitda is frequently used by securities analysts investors and other parties to evaluate companies in the industry adjusted ebitda is believed to be helpful to investors because it provides additional information about trends in the core operating performance prior to considering the impact of capital structure depreciation amortization and taxation on the results adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with ifrs adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool

ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for these replacements although share of the profit of associates is a non cash charge adjusted ebitda does not consider the potential collection of dividends and other companies may calculate adjusted ebitda differently limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure the company compensates for the inherent limitations associated with using

decreased 14 to 3 471 gwh as compared to 4 039 gwh during the same period of 2017 see section c main operating metrics mainly due to a 44 decrease in the hydro generation explained by the decision from cammesa to increase the water reserves for 2019 s summer months and a reduction in the waterflow from the limay and collón curá rivers adjusted ebitda increased to ps 31 989 million in 2018 a 461

expansion plans to increase our installed capacity from both renewable and conventional sources this shows the strong commitment of central puerto which even in a complex economic context focuses in the future consolidating itself as one of the leaders of the market providing solutions to the energy requirements of argentina jorge rauber ceo central puerto res se 70 2018 on november 7 2018 the secretariat of energy issued res 70 2018 which authorized generators to procure their own fuel for assets under the energía base regulatory framework if generation companies opt to take this option cammessa will value and pay the generators their respective fuel costs in accordance with the variable costs of production cvp declared by each generator to cammesa according to cammesa s procedure the machines with the lower cvps are dispatched first and consequently may produce more electric energy the agency in charge of dispatch organismo encargado del despacho or oed using the spanish acronym cammesa will continue to supply the fuel for those generation companies that do not take this option application of ias 29 given that argentina s accumulated triennial inflation either calculated based on the wholesale price index or the consumer price index is currently over 100 and the revised targets of the national government and other available projections indicate that this trend will not reverse in the short term the argentine economy is currently considered hyperinflationary under ias 29 under ias 29 entities that must prepare their financial statements pursuant to ifrs and whose functional currency is the argentine peso such as central puerto must restate their financial statements relating to annual or intermediate periods such restatement must take place as if the economy had always been hyperinflationary using a general price index that reflects changes in the purchasing power of the currency accordingly the financial statements have been stated in terms of the measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period including the corresponding financial figures for previous periods informed for comparative purposes b recent news purchase of brigadier lópez plant on february 27 central puerto was awarded the brigadier lópez plant in the auction conducted by integración energética argentina s a ieasa the plant currently operates with a gas turbine 280 mw in an open cycle configuration and is currently in advance stages to add a steam turbine in a combined cycle configuration which will add 140 mw once completed the combined cycle will increase its efficiency significantly becoming one of the most efficient combined cycle of argentina in terms of heat rate approximately 1 485 kcal kwh according to cammesa s estimations the power capacity and the energy produced will be taken by cammesa under ppa agreements the price offered for the transaction was us 165 million from which us 155 million will be paid in cash and us 10 million will be settled with the transfer of trade receivables owed to the company by cammesa lvfvd accrued under the res se 95 13 regulatory framework central puerto will also assume us 161 million in debt to be paid in 41 monthly equal installments starting on april 2019 and accruing a 6 months libor 5 variable or 6 25 fixed interest rate the highest the plant is expected to be transferred effectively on april 1 2019 new regulatory framework for energía base units on march 1 2019 the secretariat of renewable resources and electric market issued res 1 2019 which replaces the tariff scheme for the

capacity off time due to scheduled maintenance agreed with cammesa is not included in the ratio in 4q2018 energy generation from continuing operations decreased 14 to 4 422 gwh compared to 4q2017 mainly due to a 44 decrease in the hydro generation explained by the decision from cammesa to increase the water reserves for 2019 s summer months and reduction in the waterflow from the limay and collón curá rivers while thermal production in the period decreased 2 this decrease was partially offset by the increase in energy generation from the wind farms achiras i and la castellana i which started operations on the 3q2018 during 4q2018 machine availability of thermal units was 94 compared to 91 in 4q2017 showing a sustained level and well above the market average availability for thermal units for the same period of 79 according to data from cammesa finally steam production showed a 11 decrease totaling 256 000 tons produced during 4q2018 compared to 289 000 tons during the 4q2017 due to less demand by our client during 2018 energy generation from continuing operations decreased 7 to 14 479 gwh compared to 2017 affected by a 16 decrease in thermal generation mainly due to scheduled maintenance in the puerto combined cycle plant during 2q2018 the temporary impact on thermal production was partially offset by a 13 increase in hydro generation due to greater water flow and the increase in energy production due to the star of operations of achiras i and la castellana i during 2018 machine availability of thermal units was 89 compared to 90 in 2017 mainly due to the above mentioned extension unscheduled of the maintenance of the puerto combined cycle plant nonetheless central puerto s availability was higher than the market average of 79 for the same period according to data from cammesa finally during 2018 steam production decreased 6 to 1 103 000 tons compared to 1 178 000 during the same period of 2017 due to less demand by our client renewable energy

205 13 564 2018 results analysis revenues from continuing operations increased 48 to ps 14 265 million in the 2018 as compared to ps 9 639 million in 2017 the increase in revenues was mainly driven by i the tariff increase established by res 19 17 which set higher prices for energy generation and machine availability and set them in us dollars 2018 was fully impacted by the november 2017 tariff increase ii an increase in the exchange rate for 2018 higher than the inflation for the period which impacted tariffs set in us dollars in terms of argentine pesos current at the end of the reporting period as a reference during 2018 the foreign exchange rate increased 102 2 and inflation rate was 47 6 while during 2017 the foreign exchange rate increased 17 4 and the inflation rate was 24 8 and iii the price for the self supplied fuel recognized by cammesa in accordance to res 70 18 for the natural gas used during november and december 2018 in some of the units under the energía base regulatory framework which amounted ps 2 129 million this was partially offset by a 7 decrease in energy generation from continuing operations that totaled 14 479 gwh during 2018 and less availability from our thermal units during 2018 mainly because of the scheduled maintenance of the puerto combined cycle plant the table below sets forth the tariff scheme for energía base which was effective between november 2017 and february 2019 by source of generation thermal hydro capacity payments res 19 171 up to us 7 000 per mw per month us 3 000 per mw per month energy payments res 19 17 us 7 per

achievement of the guaranteed bid capacity digo in spanish that each generator may send to cammesa twice a year for further details see item 4 b business overview the argentine electric power sector remuneration scheme the current remuneration scheme in the annual report on form 20 f filed with the sec on april 27 2018 gross profit increased 75 to ps 7 779 million compared to ps 4 439 million in 2017 this increase was due to i the above mentioned increase in revenues and ii a less than proportional increase in costs of sales that totaled ps 6 487 million a 25 increase as compared to ps 5 199 million in 2017 the increase in the cost of sales was primarily driven by i the cost of the self supplied fuel purchased in accordance to res 70 18 described above for around ps 1 9 billion iv a higher cost of natural gas for the units that generate steam or electric energy under the energía plus framework mainly due an increase in the exchange rate for 2018 that was higher than the inflation for the period which impacted in the us dollars denominated price of natural gas in terms of argentine pesos current at the end of the reporting period as a reference during 2018 the foreign exchange rate increased 102 2 and inflation rate was 47 6 while during 2017 the foreign exchange rate increased 17 4 and the inflation rate was 24 8 this was partially offset by lower prices in us dollars this was partially offset by a 7 8 decrease in the non fuel related costs of production mainly due to i a 7 decrease in energy generation which resulted in a decrease of ps 119 million in maintenance costs a ps 59 million decrease in depreciation and a ps 23 million decrease in consumption of materials and spare parts ii a decrease in ps 82 million decrease in the purchase of energy and power iii lower than inflation increases in costs such as compensation to employees and other long term employee benefits as a consequence gross profit margin increased 8 5 p p reaching 55 in 2018 operating income before other operating results net increased 89 to ps 6 389 million compared to ps 3 383 million in 2017 this increase was due to i the above mentioned increase in gross profits and ii a less than proportional increase in administrative and selling expenses that totaled ps 1 389 million a 32 increase as compared to ps 1 056 million in 2017 this increase was mainly driven by i a 86 increase in taxes on bank account transactions due to increased revenues costs and capital expenditures completed during the period ii a 270 increase in maintenance expenses mainly as a result of civil works conducted on the office buildings conducted during 2018 and ii a 26 increase in fees and compensation for professional services due to legal and financial advisory and consultancy services used during the period adjusted ebitda increased to ps 31 989 million in 2018 compared to ps 5 705 million in 2017 this exceptionally high increase was driven by i the increase in operating results before other operating income net mentioned above ii a ps 11 017 million during the 2018 from a one time gain from the cvo commercial operation approval the cvo effect and iii ps 13 953 million during the 2018

income minus share of the profit of associates minus depreciation and amortization plus income tax expense plus depreciation and amortization minus net results of discontinued operations adjusted ebitda is believed to provide useful supplemental information to investors about the company and its results adjusted ebitda is among the measures used by the company s management team to evaluate the financial and operating performance and make day to day financial and operating decisions in addition adjusted ebitda is frequently used by securities analysts investors and other parties to evaluate companies in the industry adjusted ebitda is believed to be helpful to investors because it provides additional information about trends in the core operating performance prior to considering the impact of capital structure depreciation amortization and taxation on the results adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with ifrs adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool including adjusted ebitda does not reflect changes in including cash requirements for our working capital needs

finance income adjusted ebitda does not reflect our income tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our income taxes although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges the assets being depreciated or amortized often will need to be replaced in the future and adjusted ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for these replacements although share of the profit of associates is a non cash charge adjusted ebitda does not consider the potential collection of dividends and other companies may calculate adjusted ebitda differently limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure

secretariat of energy issued res 70 2018 which authorized generators to procure their own fuel for assets under the energía base regulatory framework if generation companies opt to take this option cammessa will value and pay the generators their respective fuel costs in accordance with the variable costs of production cvp declared by each generator to cammesa according to cammesa s procedure the machines with the lower cvps are dispatched first and consequently may produce more electric energy the agency in charge of dispatch organismo encargado del despacho or oed using the spanish acronym cammesa will continue to supply the fuel for those generation companies that do not take this option application of ias 29 given that argentina s accumulated triennial inflation either calculated based on the wholesale price index or the consumer price index is currently over 100 and the revised targets of the national government and other available projections indicate that this trend will not reverse in the short term the argentine economy is currently considered hyperinflationary under ias 29 under ias 29 entities that must prepare their financial statements pursuant to ifrs and whose functional currency is the argentine peso such as central puerto must restate their financial statements relating to annual or intermediate periods such restatement must take place as if the economy had always been hyperinflationary using a general price index that reflects changes in the purchasing power of the currency accordingly the financial statements have been stated in

on april 1 2019 new regulatory framework for energía base units on march 1 2019 the secretariat of renewable resources and electric market issued res 1 2019 which replaces the tariff scheme for the

capacity off time due to scheduled maintenance agreed with cammesa is not included in the ratio in 4q2018 energy generation from continuing operations decreased 14 to 4 422 gwh compared to 4q2017 mainly due to a 44 decrease in the hydro generation explained by the decision from cammesa to increase the water reserves for 2019 s summer months and reduction in the waterflow from the limay and collón curá rivers while thermal production in the period decreased 2 this decrease was partially offset by the increase in energy generation from the wind farms achiras i and la castellana i which started operations on the 3q2018 during 4q2018 machine availability of thermal units was 94 compared to 91 in 4q2017 showing a sustained level and well above the market average availability for thermal units for the same period of 79 according to data from cammesa finally steam production showed a 11 decrease totaling 256 000 tons produced during 4q2018 compared to 289 000 tons during the 4q2017 due to less demand by our client during 2018 energy generation from continuing operations decreased 7 to 14 479 gwh compared to 2017 affected by a 16 decrease in thermal generation mainly due to scheduled maintenance in the puerto combined cycle plant during 2q2018 the temporary impact on thermal production was partially offset by a 13 increase in hydro generation due to greater water flow and the increase in energy production due to the star of operations of achiras i and la castellana i during 2018 machine availability of thermal units was 89 compared to 90 in 2017 mainly due to the above mentioned extension unscheduled of the maintenance of the puerto combined cycle plant nonetheless central puerto s availability was higher than the market average of 79 for the same period according to data from cammesa finally during 2018 steam production decreased 6 to 1 103 000 tons compared to 1 178 000 during the same period of 2017 due to less demand by our client renewable energy

205 13 564 2018 results analysis revenues from continuing operations increased 48 to ps 14 265 million in the 2018 as compared to ps 9 639 million in 2017 the increase in revenues was mainly driven by i the tariff increase established by res 19 17 which set higher prices for energy generation and machine availability and set them in us dollars 2018 was fully impacted by the november 2017 tariff increase ii an increase in the exchange rate for 2018 higher than the inflation for the period which impacted tariffs set in us dollars in terms of argentine pesos current at the end of the reporting period as a reference during 2018 the foreign exchange rate increased 102 2 and inflation rate was 47 6 while during 2017 the foreign exchange rate increased 17 4 and the inflation rate was 24 8 and iii the price for the self supplied fuel recognized by cammesa in accordance to res 70 18 for the natural gas used during november and december 2018 in some of the units under the energía base regulatory framework which amounted ps 2 129 million this was partially offset by a 7 decrease in energy generation from continuing operations that totaled 14 479 gwh during 2018 and less availability from our thermal units during 2018 mainly because of the scheduled maintenance of the puerto combined cycle plant the table below sets forth the tariff scheme for energía base which was effective between november 2017 and february 2019 by source of generation thermal hydro capacity payments res 19 171 up to us 7 000 per mw per month us 3 000 per mw per month energy payments res 19 17 us 7 per mwh for generation with natural gas us 10 per mwh for generation with fuel oil gas oil us 4 9 per mwh 1effective prices for capacity payment depended on the availability of each unit and the achievement of the guaranteed bid capacity digo in spanish that each generator may send to cammesa twice a year for further details see item 4 b business overview the argentine electric power sector remuneration scheme the current remuneration scheme in the annual report on form 20 f filed with the sec on april 27 2018 gross profit increased 75 to ps 7 779 million compared to ps 4 439 million in 2017 this increase was due to i the above mentioned increase in revenues and ii a less than proportional increase in costs of sales that totaled ps 6 487 million a 25 increase as compared to ps 5 199 million in 2017 the increase in the cost of sales was primarily driven by i the cost of the self supplied fuel purchased in accordance to res 70 18 described above for around ps 1 9 billion iv a higher cost of natural gas for the units that generate steam or electric energy under the energía plus framework mainly due an increase in the exchange rate for 2018 that was higher than the inflation for the period which impacted in the us dollars denominated price of natural gas in terms of argentine pesos current at the end of the reporting period as a reference during 2018 the foreign exchange rate increased 102 2 and inflation rate was 47 6 while during 2017 the foreign exchange rate increased 17 4 and the inflation rate was 24 8 this was partially offset by lower prices in us dollars this was partially offset by a 7 8 decrease in the non fuel related costs of production mainly due to i a 7 decrease in energy generation which resulted in a decrease of ps 119 million in maintenance costs a ps 59 million decrease in depreciation and a ps 23 million decrease in consumption of materials and spare parts ii a decrease in ps 82 million decrease in the purchase of energy and power iii lower than inflation increases in costs such as compensation to employees and other long term employee benefits as a consequence gross profit margin increased 8 5 p p reaching 55 in 2018 operating income before other operating results net increased 89 to ps 6 389 million compared to ps 3 383 million in 2017 this increase was due to i the above mentioned increase in gross profits and ii a less than proportional increase in administrative and selling expenses that totaled ps 1 389 million a 32 increase as compared to ps 1 056 million in 2017 this increase was mainly driven by i a 86 increase in taxes on bank account transactions due to increased revenues costs and capital expenditures completed during the period ii a 270 increase in maintenance expenses mainly as a result of civil works conducted on the office buildings conducted during 2018 and ii a 26 increase in fees and compensation for professional services due to legal and financial advisory and consultancy services used during the period adjusted ebitda increased to ps 31 989 million in 2018 compared to ps 5 705 million in 2017 this exceptionally high increase was driven by i the increase in operating results before other operating income net mentioned above ii a ps 11 017 million during the 2018 from a one time gain from the cvo commercial operation approval the cvo effect and iii ps 13 953 million during the 2018 from the foreign exchange difference and interest accrued on the trade receivables denominated in us dollars mainly from foni trade receivables net income increased to ps 17 185 million or ps 11 64 per share in 2018 compared to ps 5 262 million or ps 3 52 per share in 2017 in addition to the above mentioned factors net income was i negatively impacted by higher financial expenses that amounted to ps 6 301 million in 2018 compared to ps 1201 million in 2017 and ii positively impacted by higher financial income which amounted to ps 2 280 million during 2018 compared to ps 1 559 million in 2017 in each case under i and ii mainly due to the foreign exchange difference over us dollar denominated debt and financial assets which excludes foni and other trade receivables additionally during 2018 the results from discontinued operation decreased to ps 276 million during 2018 compared to ps 791 million in 2017 and the results from the share of profit of associates decreased to ps 1 074 million in 2018 as compared to ps 1 173 million in 2017 mainly due to an extraordinary gain from tgm registered in 2017 partially offset by better results from the operations of ecogas finally results from exposure to the change in the purchasing power of the currency totaled ps 4 036 196 million in 2018 as compared to ps 151 million in 2017 foni collections increased to ps 654 million in 2018

overview last minute statements meant to clarify what many mps find to be the most odious part of the withdrawal bill the backstop for the irish border is goosed global equity markets even though it does not seem as if the withdrawal bill has changed one iota and after the big rally in us shares yesterday there might have been follow through buying in any case today asian markets did not disappoint nearly all of the major bourses were up over one percent and several of the larger indices gapped higher including the nikkei shanghai composite the hang seng taiwan s taiex and south korea s kospi europe s dow jones stoxx 600 also gapped higher but was trying to fill the gap in the morning session the three dollar a barrel increase in the price of wti the rally in equities appears to be sapping the strength of the bond market yields are mostly 1 2 bp firmer there are a couple of exceptions uk 10 year gilt yields are up four basis points while on the other side of the spectrum greece s 10 year yield is a couple basis points softer even after the eurogroup of european finance ministers delayed the first post aid package payout due to lack of performance the funds are expected to be delivered next month the us dollar is weaker against nearly all the world s currencies sterling snapped a seven day slide yesterday traded almost to 1 33 today after dipped below 1 29 to start the week among the g10 currencies the japanese yen is heavier in the risk on mood while the canadian and australian dollars are also struggling among the emerging markets currencies the philippine peso has slid following comments by the central bank governor warned its currency is already strong and seemed to threaten intervention if it got stronger asia pacific weak south korean trade data for the first part of march showed yesterday continued to show powerful headwinds however other reports suggest asian trade may have begun improving earlier today the philippines reported that exports fell less than expected january exports fell by 1 7 less than half of what economists expected imports rose by 5 8 economists expected around a 4 decline part of the difference seems to be industry specific in south korea for example semiconductor exports have fallen by more than a quarter though today the semiconductor equities turned in a strong showing at the same time japan does not appear to have emerged from its economic funk yesterday japan reported that preliminary february machine tool orders fell by a little more than 29 it is the fourth month of double digit losses and is nearly evenly split between domestic and foreign demand a survey by the ministry of finance found sentiment among manufacturers to be the worst in three years the bank of japan meets later this week no one expects a change in stance now but a bloomberg survey found that 37 expected the boj s next move to be easing policy more than double the number from january it is expected that the boj lower its outlook for output and exports the australian dollar held 0 7000 last week perhaps helped by some large options struck there it is advancing for its third consecutive session and has tested the 0 7080 area which corresponds to a 38 2 retracement of the decline from late february the 50 retracement is seen near 0 7100 the real test for the aussie bears might be in the 0 7125 to 0 7150 area today there is an a 765 mln 0 7050 option the dollar is continuing to recover against the yen after falling to about jpy110 80 at the end of last week it is trading near jpy111 50 today last week s high was near jpy112 15 options at jpy111 55 for 570 mln will roll off today the chinese yuan strengthened for the first time in nine sessions europe there is one overriding issue today and it is brexit the house of commons is scheduled to vote later today on the withdrawal bill there are claims that a new concession was made by the ec but this is spin the withdrawal bill was not re open or changed what has changed is that parts of the withdrawal bill are being emphasized to ease fears that the irish backstop locks the uk indefinitely however the withdrawal bill does have clauses that spell out conditions on which the uk s obligations could cease including if an independent panel judges that the other side is not negotiating in good faith and is seeking to make the backstop permanent moreover as a sovereign power the uk reserves the right to unilaterally decide on its own to leave the backstop the withdrawal bill lost by a historic margin a couple months ago the events markets predictit org are still favoring some kind of postponement sterling s three cent advance off yesterday s lows warns of the vulnerability of a defeat of the bill today if it is defeated the house of commons will vote tomorrow on leaving without an agreement if that too fails to secure a majority then a vote thursday will be held to seek an extension separately the uk reported a series of better

overview last minute statements meant to clarify what many mps find to be the most odious part of the withdrawal bill the backstop for the irish border has goosed global equity markets even though it does not seem as if the withdrawal bill has changed one iota and after the big rally in us shares yesterday there might have been follow through buying in any case today asian markets did not disappoint nearly all of the major bourses were up over one percent and several of the larger indices gapped higher including the nikkei shanghai composite the hang seng taiwan s taiex and south korea s kospi europe s dow jones stoxx 600 also gapped higher but was trying to fill the gap in the morning session a three dollar a barrel increase in the price of wti the rally in equities appears to be sapping the strength of the bond market yields are mostly 1 2 bps firmer there are a couple of exceptions uk 10 year gilt yields are up four basis points while on the other side of the spectrum greece s 10 year yield is a couple basis points softer even after the eurogroup of european finance ministers delayed the first post aid package payout due to lack of performance the funds are expected to be delivered next month the us dollar is weaker against nearly all the world s currencies sterling snapped a seven day slide yesterday trading almost to 1 33 today after it dipped below 1 29 to start the week among the g10 currencies the japanese yen is heavier in the risk on mood while the canadian and australian dollars are also struggling among the emerging markets currencies the philippine peso has slid following comments by the central bank governor warning its currency is already strong and seemed to threaten intervention if it got stronger asia pacific weak south korean trade data for the first part of march released yesterday continued to show powerful headwinds however other reports suggest asian trade may have begun improving earlier today the philippines reported that exports fell less than expected january exports fell by 1 7 less than half of what economists expected imports rose by 5 8 economists expected around a 4 decline part of the difference seems to be industry specific in south korea for example semiconductor exports have fallen by more than a quarter though today the semiconductor equities turned in a strong showing at the same time japan does not appear to have emerged from its economic funk yesterday japan reported that preliminary february machine tool orders fell by a little more than 29 it is the fourth month of double digit losses and is nearly evenly split between domestic and foreign demand a survey by the ministry of finance found sentiment among manufacturers to be the worst in three years the bank of japan meets later this week no one expects a change in stance now but a bloomberg survey found that 37 expected the boj s next move to be easing policy more than double the number from january it is expected that the boj will lower its outlook for output and exports the australian dollar held 0 7000 last week perhaps helped by some large options struck there it is advancing for its third consecutive session and has tested the 0 7080 area which corresponds to a 38 2 retracement of the decline from late february the 50 retracement is seen near 0 7100 the real test for the aussie bears might be in the 0 7125 to 0 7150 area today

brexit the house of commons is scheduled to vote later today on the withdrawal bill there are claims that a new concession was made by the ec but this is spin the withdrawal bill was not re opened or changed what has changed is that parts of the withdrawal bill are being emphasized to ease fears that the irish backstop locks the uk indefinitely however the withdrawal bill does have clauses that spell out conditions on which the uk s obligations could cease including if an independent panel judges that the other side is not negotiating in good faith and is seeking to make the backstop permanent moreover as a sovereign power the uk reserves the right to unilaterally decide on its own to leave the backstop the withdrawal bill lost by a historic margin a couple months ago the events markets predictit org are still favoring some kind of postponement sterling s three cent advance off yesterday s lows warns of the vulnerability of a defeat of the bill today if it is defeated the house of commons will vote tomorrow on leaving without an agreement if that too fails to secure a majority then a vote thursday will be held to seek an extension separately the uk reported a series of

the beginning of china s rise as a global power can be dated to the country s accession to the world trade organization wto in 2001 throughout the next 16 years of the bush and obama administrations the united states engaged in intensive bilateral diplomacy with china with the aim of getting ever greater chinese support on issues ranging from security to the economy to the environment the bush administration launched a strategic economic dialogue with china and a separate security dialogue president obama combined these into a single strategic and economic dialogue s ed but the change in form was not important the dialogues represented a continuous effort to draw china into the global system diplomacy is the art of trying to get other countries to do what you want in the case of the united states we wanted china to support the economic and security institutions that were established under our leadership at the end of world war ii it is fashionable now to argue that the whole strategy of engaging china and inviting it into our global institutions has failed but this assessment is too negative in this essay i identify eight specific issues on which we engaged intensely with china the scorecard of these results is quite mixed by my assessment in three areas china s actions have gone beyond what reasonably could have been expected in two areas the outcomes are about what should have been expected and on three issues china has failed to do what we want it is interesting that these successes and failures don t map onto particular arenas be they economics or security it is this mixed record of diplomacy that makes it difficult to decide what to do next some voices call for decoupling and isolating china through a new cold war which would be very costly and is too hostile a response to the record the objective here would be to prevent china from rising to be a coequal power and is likely to fail there is also a conciliation or adaptation camp that believes that the united states must accept the reality of our relative decline and chinese emergence as the world s foremost power specific actions here would be pulling back from our alliance system and from multilateral institutions i argue that alternatively we can draw on these lessons of failure and success to tailor an engagement strategy going forward that would be effective in gaining chinese cooperation in more areas though probably not in all areas track record of diplomacy as china grew and emerged in the early twenty first century what we wanted diplomatically was ever increasing support for global public goods which include financial stability carbon reduction and nuclear non proliferation one dimension of this was economic in the mid 2000s china had developed a large current account surplus that ultimately reached a disruptive 10 percent of gdp supported by an under valued currency the country was partially open but still had many import and investment restrictions and its protection of intellectual property rights ipr was poor the united states s positions on these issues could be viewed as narrowly in the country s self interest as the united states was the big deficit country and the largest holder of intellectual property ip in the world but more important reciprocal openness ipr protection and limitations on global imbalances are the foundations of the global economic system it might be annoying when small countries get a free ride but it isn t a threat to the global system if china does so on the other hand it has the potential to undermine the entire global economy the united states also consistently urged china to cooperate on a number of security and military issues one of these was nuclear non proliferation specifically in the cases of iran and north korea dprk the united states urged china to settle disputes including territorial ones peacefully this has become an increasingly important issue as china has militarized the south china sea and confronted its neighbors over territorial claims the united states has engaged in intensive diplomacy on three other global public goods first climate change china has emerged overwhelmingly as the largest emitter of carbon so there is no way to address climate goals without strong cooperation from china second development assistance we have encouraged china to become more active in and more generous to development institutions such as the world bank and the international monetary fund third is the issue of human rights within china and outside of it in the countries with which it has developed deep economic and political relations so what is the scorecard on u s diplomacy in these eight areas i divide them into surprising successes predictable progress and disappointing failures surprising successes imbalances and currency china entered the global financial crisis with a current account surplus near 10 percent of gdp and a currency widely viewed as undervalued china s exports dropped sharply in the wake of the crisis and because of the country s stimulus program its imports recovered quickly after a brief fall off at the time it seemed likely that the resulting fall in china s trade surplus would be temporary and that with global recovery it would return but in fact that did not happen because of a range of constructive measures implemented by the government the currency was allowed to gradually appreciate and on a trade weighted basis it appreciated about 50 percent between 2005 and 2015 more than any other major currency a trade surplus reflects a gap between savings and investment and china introduced policies that encouraged consumption and reduced national savings tax and tariff reductions increased spending on health and education and strengthened urban and rural safety nets for 2018 as a whole china s current account will be very close to zero reducing the large trade surplus provided demand and trading opportunities to the rest of the world by 2017 there were 144 countries that had more trade with china than with the united states including 50 in africa and all asian countries except afghanistan and bhutan i participated in the first five s eds in my role as the treasury department s representative in beijing on the macro side we argued that it would be realistic for china to bring its surplus down to 4 percent of gdp i do not think any economist was expecting zero so quickly for this reason i list this as the biggest and most surprising success it should be noted that u s bilateral diplomacy on this issue was complemented in important ways by multilateral institutions the imf played a constructive role through its analysis and engagement with china the g20 was also an important forum the issue of global imbalances was taken seriously in the g20 during the period between 2008 and 2013 since then it seems to have fallen off the agenda the success of engagement with china on imbalances and currency is little appreciated on the u s side however because it has not been matched by a trend in the u s current account deficit the deficit was reduced in the wake of the crash but it is rising again primarily because of the large tax cut implemented in 2018 china however is no longer a counterpart for the united states in terms of deficit rather american counterparts include germany japan south korea taiwan and a few others climate change in the mid 2000s any discussion over climate change and carbon reduction took on a predictable character in beijing advanced economies had caused the problem and they had to solve it historically the united states and other advanced countries were responsible for most of the carbon in the atmosphere they would have to bear the cost of mitigation through their own carbon reduction and payments to developing countries to bribe them to join in ten years later china was ready to make commitments to reduce carbon emissions the change in the chinese attitude that led to the paris accord was remarkable taking place in such a short period of time this was a real triumph of u s diplomacy enticing china with the prospect that there could be no commitment from the u s side unless china and other emerging markets participated as well china s commitment to reach peak emissions by 2030 and thereafter reduce carbon emissions was encouraged by the air pollution crisis that overtook the country in the years surrounding the 2008 beijing olympics it became clear that burning coal would have to be severely restricted a policy that was implemented in major cities that was a first step toward carbon reduction china had become increasingly aware of the costs that climate change would impose on its own economy and society further china became enamored of the idea of developing manufacturing leadership in areas such as solar and wind power as well as electric vehicles as with our success on trade imbalances the u s bilateral effort was complemented by multilateral efforts nesting the u s china agreement on carbon reduction in the larger multilateral paris accord was critical nuclear non proliferation iran north korea china has a natural interest in nuclear nonproliferation however it was always going to be difficult to get full cooperation from china on iran and the drpk in the case of iran china is the largest global importer of petroleum whereas the united states has moved toward near balance in its petroleum account thus approaches that take iranian oil and gas off the world market are going to hurt china but be neutral with respect to the u s economy in the case of the dprk a neighbor and ally alongside of whom china has fought china prefers not to see nuclear weapons but even more strongly prefers not to see the regime collapse in the case of iran the obama administration s skillful diplomacy brought china on board the united states successfully lobbied china and other major oil importers to reduce but not eliminate purchases from iran while keeping an eye on global supply and prices the fact that the united states was willing to work through the un security council also was a plus for china which abhors unilateral sanctions or actions and puts a lot of stock in upholding the un system where it has a lot of legitimacy and a veto this is another case in which the u s bilateral diplomacy was nested in a multilateral effort the same can be said for the recent un sanctions on the dprk by restricting exports and imports with north korea china has been willing to squeeze the dprk enough to bring it to the negotiating table without squeezing so hard that it collapsed china s actions were motivated in part by its fear that absent a diplomatic solution the united states would resort to unilateral military action against the north dprk s nuclear tests were also close to the chinese border and chinese officials worried about potential accidents but now that the dprk has come to the negotiating table and halted at least temporarily testing nuclear weapons and missiles china seems relatively happy with this status quo the united states on the other hand has failed to follow up in a meaningful way on negotiating real denuclearization as to be expected ip rights protection u s firms have long had complaints about poor ipr protection in china fake goods appropriate international brands patented technologies are copied in the most egregious cases the people s liberation army has used cyberwarfare to steal commercial secrets and pass them onto chinese state enterprises foreign investors acknowledge that ipr protection has gradually improved china has set up a system of ipr courts that are now adjudicating huge numbers of cases mostly among chinese enterprises but foreign firms often feel that they are not treated fairly in these courts what we have observed in china is the common historical pattern in which developing countries have little incentive and ability to protect ipr but as their own inventive capacities improve there begins to be a demand for better ipr protection on international indices of ipr protection china scores slightly better than brazil india and other large emerging markets the united states was citing south korea and taiwan as ipr violators up through 2008 at which point they were well ahead of china s stage of development by many measures china is now the second most inventive economy after the united states hence why china is increasing its effort to protect ipr i put developments in ipr in the category of as to be expected development assistance be careful what you wish for the united states has long exhorted china to be more active in giving development assistance the united states s idea was that china should contribute more to existing multilateral institutions particularly the concessional window at the world bank which lends at zero interest to the poorest countries in the world and the imf china has in fact emerged as one of the most important financiers for the imf it recently gave a 50 million grant to the imf s fund to support technical assistance for financial officials in developing countries china s contributions to the world bank s concessional fund have grown as well and reached 600 million at the most recent replenishment but these sums are dwarfed by its funding of a new bank the asian infrastructure investment bank aiib and by the explosion of chinese bilateral financing china opened the aiib partly out of frustration at the slow pace of governance reform at the world bank and imf to reflect the growing weight of china and other emerging markets in the world economy and partly out of frustration that the world bank had turned away from infrastructure and growth to focus more on education health and microfinance the united states opposed the launching of aiib but most allies ignored our protests by the end of 2018 aiib was off to a very good start after initially funding power and transport projects in asia it is moving now into africa and latin america and will soon have about 100 members more than any other regional development bank most chinese financing for development however is not coming through aiib but rather is provided via the china development bank and the export import bank of china much of this is branded as the belt and road initiative but china s infrastructure financing is in fact global the policy banks lack transparency but they seem to be lending about 50 billion per year primarily in energy and transport most of the lending is in dollars at commercial variable interest rates some of their clients are already getting into trouble with unsustainable debt though so far this is a small number and the problem should not be exaggerated my overall assessment of china s role in development assistance is that it is also about as expected china is becoming a major funder which is natural given its size and the declining investment opportunities at home due to the buildup of overcapacity in many sectors some of this financing is going through multilateral vehicles world bank imf aiib that are likely to ensure better outcomes but it comes as no surprise that china wants to keep most of this under its direct control via its policy banks and that their activities would raise issues of debt sustainability as well as environmental and social safeguards disappointing failures market access when i moved to beijing in 2004 i started attending workshops on economic reform among other things i argued that china had received a lot of benefit from opening up sectors of its economy to imports and foreign investment 100 percent owned not joint ventures but that many sectors remained closed or partially closed china would receive additional benefits from opening up these sectors some of which were in advanced manufacturing such as vehicles and many of which were in services like finance and telecom when i left nine years later it would have been hard to point to any area of success i consider this a disappointing failure because such openings would have been clearly beneficial to the chinese economy and would have defused trade tensions with the united states and other partners this issue was largely dealt with through bilateral talks the united states did bring occasional wto cases against chinese practices but some of china s protection as in autos was allowed under its wto agreement in other cases the wto action did not eliminate the issue for example the united states brought a case on credit cards and electronic payments against china to the wto we won that case but years later there are still no foreign firms providing payments in local currency it is naturally an area in which there is strict regulation somehow these regulations have so far kept foreign investors out militarization of the south china seas china has moved ahead steadily with the occupation and militarization of islands in the south china seas scs under international law most if not all of the features in the scs are uninhabitable rocks and therefore not entitled to economic exclusion zones still countries can own the rocks and china has as good a claim to some of them as do other countries in the region the united states does not take a position on ownership of the rocks but has an interest in preserving freedom of navigation throughout the scs and in seeing the territorial disputes resolved peacefully i recall that the first meeting at the first s ed in 2009 was a discussion of core interests between hillary clinton tim geithner wang qishan vice premier responsible for the economic issues and dai bingguo state councilor responsible for the security issues the chinese representatives defined their core interests as sovereignty over taiwan tibet and xinjiang they did not mention the scs president xi jinping promised president obama at one of their earliest meetings not to militarize the spratlys a group of small islands and atolls that sit between vietnam and the philippines yet the chinese military soon after proceeded to build up artificial islands and military capabilities the u s navy continues to send freedom of navigation operations through the area and there have been a number of near misses between planes and ships of the two militaries china s actions have alarmed its neighbors but the united states has not been able to persuade china to desist from the militarization of the islands this has clearly been a failure of u s diplomacy democracy and human rights at the time that china joined the wto in 2001 it was rated unfree by freedom house specifically it earned a 7 on political rights and a 6 on civil liberties on a scale from 1 7 in which the higher the number the less free the society some who advocated engagement with china argued that the country s integration into the global system would lead to gradual political changes however 17 years later china has exactly the same rankings china experts were skeptical right from the start that there would be political change anytime soon however as the economy became more free it seemed plausible to some that there would be more scope for debate among academics and in the press and that minority groups such as tibetans and uighurs would be given some room to practice their religions and preserve their cultures to the contrary the repression of scholars journalists tibetans and uighurs has only increased over the past decade china has made great technological strides in ai enabled digital surveillance not only is it using this technology to control its people at home but there is a growing risk that it will export these methods to other authoritarian regimes lessons for engagement in summary the track record of diplomatic engagement with china is mixed but it does not support the conclusion that engagement has failed the successes all shared the characteristic that china came to see the global public good in question as clearly in its own interest also intensive u s bilateral diplomacy was complemented by multilateral institutions the united states cannot have much hope of changing chinese behavior if the ask in question cannot be nested in a multilateral agreement based on this logic there is reason to expect that we could do better on the issues of development assistance ipr protection and market access the best hope for the latter two economic issues is to include them in modern trade agreements that draw in a growing number of countries including eventually china the trans pacific partnership tpp in particular was a good effort to address some of china s abusive trade practices and it was a big mistake for the united states to pull out of the agreement the tpp could be a model for larger wto modernization on the issue of development assistance china s belt and road initiative and its other bilateral efforts are likely to run into various problems due to a lack of transparency and competition in implementation and due to the commercial nature of lending which is already causing debt sustainability problems multilateral efforts including aiib are likely to be more successful we should encourage china to learn from these experiences and to both shift more resources to the multilateral institutions and make its bilateral aid more transparent and norm conforming a key question in the u s china relationship is whether we can cooperate on these various global public goods even as we continue to have some serious disagreements in the south china sea there is a reasonable prospect of a multilateral effort to continue to reinforce freedom of navigation but there is probably no prospect of reversing china s militarization of the islands on democracy and human rights it is important for the united states to continue to speak out and to strive to be a better example for other countries but it is not likely that we can do much about the human rights situation in china meanwhile the un human rights apparatus has largely become subservient to authoritarians so that in this arena a multilateral approach is not likely to generate progress if we are to coexist peacefully with china it will be important to be honest about our differences while working together on the large number of issues where we do indeed share common goals and interests and where real progress is possible
will made in china 2025 succeed in making china the world s leading producer of high value technology is china really a threat to the world s industrialized economies on this episode george magnus discusses four red flags that may complicate china s plans for growth george magnus is an associate at the china centre at the oxford university a research associate at the school of oriental and african studies and a former chief economist for ubs his latest book is red flags why xi s china is in jeopardy you can download the episode by clicking the link above and don t forget to subscribe to my podcast on itunes or stitcher tell your friends leave a review pethokoukis let s start off with the title i have a bad habit of telling authors that their title is wrong and here s what the title should actually be i m not going to say that to you but i think some people here in the united states would wonder if china is in jeopardy because the message that we frequently hear is that china is growing faster than the united states their leaders are geniuses hoovering up all the data for their ai they re spending gobs of money on these emerging technologies and they re sort of doing everything right and it s the united states which is in jeopardy but obviously you re making what to me seems like a contrarian case from an american perspective magnus well it s a good point and in fact i suppose my knee jerk reaction is to say that you shouldn t believe everything you read in the newspapers i m sure we ll get onto a lot of this material shortly but i should explain really that the subtitle of the book about why xi s china is in jeopardy and i do explain this kind of very early on is not to predict the downfall of xi jinping or the end of the communist party s governor and system in china or anything remotely connected with the collapse of the country which others have predicted in years gone by so i m not going there the issue about jeopardy really is that i think policymaking and policy in china is probably more brittle and therefore the survival of the incumbent government shall we say is more brittle than sometimes we think it is we believe nowadays particularly after the 19th party congress in 2017 and the national people s congress in 2018 that xi jinping is omnipotent and all powerful and all he has to do is wave his fingers and magical things will happen in china and everything is hunky dory and i don t think that s quite right and i m sure we ll go into the reasons as to why not as we go through the through the podcast whenever this topic comes up i think back to how the public perception of china changed and how people no longer think of it as just some interesting success story a country that s adopted at least some elements of market capitalism and is advancing and is on the path toward democracy or on a path toward becoming south korea and all the millions of people coming out of poverty to me one of the key moments that influenced perception in the united states was when citizens against government waste put out an ad called the chinese professor ad and it showed a future classroom in beijing maybe 20 years from now where sort of an evil looking chinese professor was telling his students about the fall of the united states and they were laughing and the us had accumulated all this debt and china was now the superpower i think that sort of it got a iot of page views and you saw it all over the place marked a change in how we perceive china certainly not the only thing and certainly there s a different view today where we see china as a threat in the book you mention a number of red flags and it s kind of an obvious place for me to go so i m going to go there let s start working through a few of those red flags that you see one is debt china has a lot of debt some of the china nears point to debt as being a real weakness of the chinese economy how do you see it what i think it is and i think it s just by way of background we should remember that at the time of the financial crisis back in 2007 2008 china s debt its non financial debt was about a 100 120 percent of gdp kind of unremarkable really but if you fast forward 10 years to last year the end of last year the level of debt gdp is up at around 300 percent of gdp maybe a little bit more now what is that what kind of debt is that alright so this includes government debt central government debt which actually is a relatively small proportion of the total as well as a lot of local and provincial government debt and corporate debt which includes non financial companies state owned enterprises private companies although private companies don t really own a lot of debt so a lot of this is in the state sector and household debt households actually have been the most recent debtors well when i say the most recent debtors i mean the rise in debt has been remarkable most recently because of households so household debt to disposable income in china is now about a 120 percent which is bigger than it is in the united states what is remarkable about china s debt story is the speed with which it s accumulated so that s in space of about 10 or 11 years and the levels to which it has risen now we should also say that since the end of 2016 the beginning of 2017 china has been quite rigorous i would say to a degree about trying to contain the growth of debt and trying to deleverage the economy they know that this is a bad thing for the chinese economy and for the outlook for growth in the future therefore they know that this has to be brought under control is that why we re seeing the economy slow now is that the main reason it is the principal reason a lot of people said well china is kind of buckling under the pressure of tariffs in the trade war that s not strictly true although it would be truer if president trump s proposals which are now the subject of negotiations with china if they did actually come to pass then i think china would actually have a very serious issue in 2019 2020 but most of the reason that the chinese economy has been slowing down and looks a little bit fragile i would say is because of the impact of deleveraging policies and the clamp down really on egregious forms of risk taking and financial behavior which is something which we should applaud but there is a cost to it and it s not certain that the chinese leadership are willing to absorb that cost we shall see well that s what i was going to suggest is this a sustained effort and are they willing to accept slower economic growth which has been sort of their main achievement year after year is very high fast rates of growth are they willing to accept maybe a sustained period of slower growth in return for more financial stability yeah so that s the 64 trillion yuan question because on the face of it and the rhetoric from party officials and from the central bank is financial stability is one of our principal objectives and we will not go down this route again of using credit to artificially stimulate the economy because it got a bad ending so on one level i think they understand this all too well on another level though and of course everything in china is nuanced we are seeing the consequences in terms of weaker economic growth and particular in terms of the labor market so labor market statistics in china like in most emerging countries are not really very good but there is quite a lot of anecdotal evidence to suggest that layoffs have picked up that some people are kind of returning to the countryside not in droves as they did in 2007 2008 but there is a sort of a fragility there and we have seen some early signs of pushback against the more stern deliberate deleveraging policies that were being pursued in 2017 and 2018 is there a growth rate that creates extreme political problems for the chinese leadership is a chinese economy that s growing forget about a recession but at 3 or 4 percent does that have wider implications than one which is growing at 6 or 7 percent does that breed any sort of instability is their economy built to run very very fast and if it s not running very very fast the whole thing comes tumbling down yeah i think this is what i would be concerned about and i think others are too is not necessarily that resolving china s debt crisis or debt problem is going to cause banks to go bust and you know a repeat of what we experienced ourselves in the west in 2008 2009 that i think is possible but unlikely right in a state owned banking system no major or even medium sized financial institutions really will be allowed to go bust or to be found to be short of liquidity but i think that resolution of excessive debt and uncommercial debt is the same whether you know the communist party is in charge or a western government is in charge of its own country as we saw 10 years ago and the cost of coming to terms with that kind of policy error is really a protracted period of low growth i think in the next kind of 5 10 years china will slow down to something like 3 or 4 percent and i think the problem there is not necessarily the number but actually what the implications might be for jobs and for the throughput of about 8 million graduates each year who have to find meaningful jobs presumably we want graduates to find meaningful jobs otherwise they can become quite restive and obviously that s got implications for social stability as well so the issue really is whether china can adjust well i think the issue for me is whether china can fulfill its aspirations and do all the things it wants to do and be all the things it wants to be in an environment where growth for a protracted period of time is going to be much lower with consequences for unemployment which have yet to show up so what is the chinese dream what is their goal what do they want that country to look like in 25 years well president xi jinping was quite open about this at the 19th party congress in 2017 so you know by the middle of the century 2049 remember is the centenary of the founding of the people s republic so i mean they don t say it in these words but i think he wants china to be effectively a paid up member of the advanced economies by 2049 but in the process of getting there over the next 32 years or whatever i think they want china to become one of the principal sources of new technologies they ve identified 10 important sectors in a policy document which is known as made in china 2025 which is the bone of contention for the us trade representative and the white house and the us administration so in leading electric vehicles in artificial intelligence in quantum computing in you know you name it in any of the kind of modern technologies that we re all trying to be top dog in china wants to be number one and it wants to not only have a world leadership in these sectors but also obviously use them as the tool with which to propel higher productivity growth in china and bring prosperity to the country in the longer term right well i want to explore that but that also provides a nice lead into another one of the red flags which is the demographic situation if your country is aging and is not having a lot of kids then that future growth needs to come from much faster productivity though china i assume still thinks it can do something on the demographic front to improve sort of current trends well yes they would like to do that and so far i don t think they are being particularly successful and i don t think they will be really there s nothing sort of specific about china there i just think the demographic problem for all of us really is really what to do about fertility it s not really about living longer which is something that we all have to kind of deal with in our individual lives and families but actually the economic problem of aging is really that there aren t enough kids growing up to become workers in the future so there s this squeeze on the working age population which translates percentage point for percentage point into lower economic growth but it also has other issues or other consequences which is the affordability of pensions and health care plans and residential care and so on so china is in kind of a unique situation in the sense that i mean it s the fastest aging country on the planet not the oldest which is probably japan but fastest aging in the sense that china s age structure will shift up in the next 20 or 22 years by as much as it is taken us to do the same sort of shift over the last century and of course they re doing it at much lower levels of income per head than we have experienced so by now when we face our aging problems in the western world we have income per capita of between 40 000 60 000 in most countries china s is about 16 000 and sure in the next 5 10 15 years that ll grow but actually it s not going to grow quickly enough as a benchmark to really compensate for the burden of providing for an aging society which i think is coming at them very very quickly indeed so ideally they should widen deepen make more generous the social safety net particularly for pensions the treatment of migrant workers health care expenditure because a lot of chinese although there is universal health care there are a lot of out of pocket expenses which the typical chinese families have to meet for their health care so this is a charge on growth as well it s another reason why i think china will be challenged in the future to sustain these very very elevated rates of economic expansion which are probably not quite as elevated as official figures would have us believe anyway right could you see a scenario where china becomes as wealthy on a per capita basis as even forget about the united states or scandinavia or canada but let s say the eastern european countries well of course it s fair to point out that there is no such thing as a sort of a black and white picture of china i mean china is a huge country with 1 4 billion people in coastal provinces and big coastal cities income per head is already on par with countries like portugal for example whereas of course in the middle of the country and in the western part of the country and in the northeastern part of the country which is where a lot of china s heavy industries are concentrated income per head is much lower so i can see that there will be provinces or cities maybe in the future which will certainly be also rans you know when it comes to kind of oecd type of comparisons but i must say in the foreseeable future i don t really see parity being reached by the way there s another issue which i think is kind of interesting to bring up here particularly given the sort of narratives that sometimes we are asked to believe about china either being or perhaps within the next 10 years being the biggest economy in the world in us dollar terms and people do this i think partly because it s sort of part of the narrative which i think china would like us to believe and partly because they just use spreadsheets from the last 35 years or 40 years and just project them into the future as if nothing is changing but one of the traps i also talk about in the book actually is the renminbi trap let s suppose that the renminbi devalues some point in the next five years by a meaningful amount so if the peg breaks let s say the history of or the empirical work on pegs suggests that usually when that happens you know you don t get a kind of a 5 or 10 percent depreciation but it can be 20 percent 30 percent sometimes more that impact on the dollar value of china s gdp could well mean that by 2025 or 2030 that china s gdp in dollar terms will not be that much different relative to the united states than it is today so i don t think it s a foregone conclusion at all why would that peg break well because and i think that this hops back to the debt problem in a way one of the phenomena that is continuing in china despite the deleveraging policies is the growth in financial system assets and liabilities so not just banks but also what we call non banking financial institutions so this would include insurance companies trust banks and other institutions that exist within the shadow banking sector shall we say so if you look at the growth of the total assets and liabilities in the financial system they re growing at a pace which is not really compatible with two other phenomena one is the existence of the peg and the other is the limited level of currency reserves now true china does have 3 trillion worth of exchange reserves although not all of those 3 trillion are liquid but let s say two thirds of them are liquid reserves it wouldn t take much in the way of capital flight emanating from the excess growth of financial system assets and liabilities to basically put the peg under pressure if the reserves actually started to fall i think if china were to really clamp down very very seriously on leverage and on the growth of banking or financial system liquidity i think the outlook would be very different in terms of its external stability but of course there would be a cost in terms of domestic growth but failing that i think that there is a kind of an inconsistency between the growth of financial assets and liabilities in renminbi terms at home and the existence of a peg which has got to be very carefully managed in conjunction with a limited level of reserves if the reserves were growing 500 billion a year no problem at all but they re out of kilter so eventually i think it ll be swamped by the outflow of capital despite the existence of capital controls the country is looking to become more technologically advanced and more innovative can china do that from a purely sort of top down government directs where subsidies go sort of growth model or do they need to adapt a more american like growth model granted china has developed some very big sort of global brands but can china get to where it wants to be technologically with a kind of a subsidy and more not to take it too far commanding control model or i ll put this way with a top down model versus a kind of more organic growth like you see in the united states right so here s another 64 trillion yuan question i think it s a question which preoccupies think tanks and policymakers and analysts all over the world which is we know that in the west we re in a bit of a bunker following the crisis 10 or 11 years ago and we are asking questions of our politicians the politicians are certainly asking questions about whether there might be a different way of doing things where the balance between the private sector and the role of government might be different from the way we ve thought about it in the past but by the same token jim i think in china the same issues exist there and in fact despite the fact that we think that the biggest issue in sort of sino western relations nowadays is trade in china they re also having a big discussion about the role of the private sector and about the role of the state so during the last year i think it s kind of interesting because there hasn t really been any opposition or disquiet about xi jinping since he came to power in 2012 but it s no coincidence i think in my mind that during the last 12 to 15 months there have been a number of instances where leading intellectuals and professors who ve had work published long enough for foreigners to translate it before it s been taken down from the chinese web where they ve questioned the path that the communist party is treading down so the party view is that china s success is attributable to the role of the party the role of industrial policy and state direction of the economy and of technology and the dissenting view is that actually this is not the basis for china s success at all and then in fact all the success that china has had over the last 40 years in fact since deng xiaoping came to power in 1978 is basically down to entrepreneurship to what the chinese called marketization which is really the incorporation of market mechanisms into the state system and to learning from the outside world about how to adapt foreign innovation and technology for the domestic chinese economy and markets so this i think kind of an interesting discussion because we think sometimes and obviously the narrative from beijing is that they have a different model which is better to ours and state direction and subsidies and industrial policies is the way to go well it might be in terms of very specific scientific and technological accomplishments let s not be childish about it because you know sending a spacecraft to the dark side of the moon or the far side of the moon and being big in e commerce and quantum computing and biomeds all of these things you know we shouldn t be slouches about this that these are things that the chinese are very good at and are very accomplished but there s more to breaking the technological barriers in the future particularly commercializing the technology establishing brands in technologies using those technologies to spawn multiple innovations across industrial sectors that you can t plan for or determine top down i still think you know i m a western trained economist so i would say this wouldn t i but i still think that this is a strength that we still have and which i think china will find that it runs up short on and i think that the stifling of innovation and the aversion to instability and what we would call creative destruction these kinds of things i think are not necessarily issues that will keep china kind of stuck in the mud as it were but i think that in many respects it will make the lead that western technologies and companies still have over china quite difficult to eradicate all together but is it the case then that beijing believes a more open economy a more entrepreneurial economy a less state directed economy is just fundamentally incompatible with a political system that s authoritarian at best that it sort of needs to believe that their alternate model works because if it doesn t that more open western model inside that model are the seeds for the demise of the chinese communist party as the leading force in that society yeah i actually think that s precisely the point so there have been over the last year sort of party officials that have spoken about the private sector having already accomplished its historic mission which is a sort of a veiled or not so veiled allusion to the fact that they ve done their bit you know that the state sector is really the only thing that s important now there s certainly been no hiding the wishes of the leadership to make the state sector and state enterprises to give them the primacy in the economy and put them in the forefront of leadership when it comes to technological accomplishment and the future prosperity of china i mean i don t think there s any beating around the bush there i think they honestly believe that this is the case and i think as you suggested really implicitly i think they believe that actually if they opened up too far and too fast to what a lot of westerners and governments would like the chinese to do i think they think that that would be existential for them because it would it would start to threaten the basis of the represent d etre for the communist party which is to rule unchallenged and not to have private enterprise or i mean controlled private enterprise but not having you know private initiative and private enterprise challenge the role of the government and of the party but is it equally existential if the west rises to separate itself from china that we have this i think you may have called it this iron curtain of technology where you have these two different tech ecosystems because the west is so worried either about chinese advances for national security purposes worries about the spying on the united states or we just fear an advanced china so we re trying to suppress their technological advance by creating an ecosystem by not letting their companies participate in our economies is that also a threat to chinese advance if we just sort of try to again create this iron curtain or bubble around the chinese economy yeah i mean it s something that i don t kind of think about with any kind of relish at all i think it s sort a lose lose situation i think they relish it in the white house well maybe i mean some may do i think that if the relationship particularly between the united states and china of course is so fundamentally different than it was between the united states and the former soviet union because the levels of interdependence between the economic systems and the trading systems of china and the united states is a different world from what it was with the old ussr so ideally and i suppose i d like to think about this slightly optimistically although maybe naively i m not sure but i think that that level of interdependence is a it s kind of a good thing despite the spat that were all having at the moment about trade and huawei and goodness knows what else but i think it creates a sort of a platform on top of which hopefully the two governments maybe not these governments but future governments as well despite difficult times and sometimes having spats can actually try to figure out kind of some way of living together even if the dearest wishes of both sides can t be fulfilled all together so there are a lot of things for example that i think china could offer to the us and to the european and other western business communities which will not cost the communist party much in terms of its credibility or authority so market access is one of the big issues which figures in negotiation the very very high levels of automobile tariffs are another issue what to do about joint ventures and technology transfer intellectual property protection i mean there are many things that i think that china might do in its own interest provided it could do so without being seen to be succumbing to foreign pressure which of course is very sensitive for them if you were in the white house would you object or try to prevent chinese companies from creating key elements of the internet backbone or of the 5g backbone would you want them not to be involved in those sorts of projects okay so i m not expert enough to know where the dividing line is between genuine threat to security and fear of technological competition i mean if we re trying to stop chinese companies from doing things because we don t think that we can compete with them actually i don t think that s good for either side it s obviously not good for the chinese because they ll be constricted and they ll get quite touchy about it is not good for us because actually we need to be good at things and need to spend resources money education to try to retain the number one position that we think we want but if there are genuine security issues and i think that these have been voiced and aired in conjunction with both the zte corporation which was the subject of dispute last year and with huawei currently then i think we do have to be very careful because you know china is not just kind of any old feisty competitor that we do business with it is an adversary it has a political system that is fundamentally different from one that we believe is acceptable and china is obviously the only major country in the world that can seek to kind of pedal its soft power and influence in foreign countries where we want to compete as well so i think it s a fair point that we should draw the line where we think that unfair advantages are at work which would give a foreign country in this case china an ability to basically evade or undermine things that we think are really valuable but that s a big judgment call

if you throw a frog into boiling water it will jump out and survive with mild burns but if you cook it by slowly raising the temperature it won t notice at first and will end up being boiled alive that is a common proverb in venezuela that describes how socialism has gradually consumed the nation at a webinar coordinated by the atlas network businessman and panam post publisher luis h ball explained that it all began nearly 50 years ago when democratic socialism began to be applied by venezuela s elected rulers subscribe to our daily newsletter in 1965 venezuelan exports represented 60 of international trade in oil toal oil exports were larger than saudi arabia s the nation had the lowest inflation in the world for 100 years there had been a constant 5 annual growth per year and 67 of the nation was middle class measured to european standards during the 1970s venezuela s per capita income was higher than the sum of all other andean nations including chile the country had the lowest taxes in the region coupled with a stable democracy since the us left the gold standard only the swiss franc and the venezuelan bolivar managed to maintain their value in 1980 the venezuelan bolivar was worth more against the u s dollar than in 1880 it remained that way until the 1973 elections when both the legislative and executive branches came under the power of a single democratic socialist party acción democrática while simultaneously the arab oil embargo that year produced a huge increase in oil prices as a result government revenues increased by a factor of 4 the government than embarked in democratic socialism systematically applying the same theories supported now in the usa by senator bernie sanders and representative alexandria ocasio cortez enormous new government programs were created the number of central government employees trebled in four years private oil companies the steel aluminum and mining industries were nationalized foreign investment was curtailed in agriculture banking an telecommunications the same applied to the central bank which until then as independent and listed in the stock market it was nationalized in 1975 then came price controls even the price of movie tickets and car wash operations were subject the controls under the administration of carlos andres perez democratic socialism took hold of venezuela and there were even attempts to create a new type of businessman through an extensive program of subsidized loans to new small industries just like marxism announced the rise of a new man who would enable socialism by forsaking his individual desires to be replaced by collective desires democratic socialism created a businessman dependent on the state this involved a leninist playing the famous leninist idea from the soviet new economic program in which the government seizes the commanding heights of the economy but allows private property to exist ironically as government revenue exploded upwards with the increase in the price of oil and bureaucracy increased exponentially per capita income began to fall dramatically as the size of government increased the private sector shrank in the same proportion under the influence of juan pablo pérez alfonzo the venezuelan oil minister during the 1960s who is considered the founder of opec the organization of petroleum exporting countries venezuela began to deliberately reduce its oil production purposefully giving up market share to arab nations perez alfonso called oil the devil s excrement by the early 1980s daily oil production fell to 1 2 million barrels down from 3 5 million in 1973 as a result of faithfully applying perez alfonzo s theories despite holding the world s largest oil reserves when it dawned on venezuela s leaders the stupidity of this policy it would take twenty years to reach a production of 2 0 million barrels in 2000 as the private sector shrank so did employment the nationalization of the central bank resulted in the destruction of the currency s value inflation reared its ugly head by 1998 venezuela was in a deep its old prosperity was long gone the governing democratic socialist parties were completely discredited people demanded change hugo chavez was trained by cuba hugo chavez himself publicly admitted having been recruited as a communist operative by alfredo maneiro founder of the causa radical party a guerrilla group operating illegally in the country during the 1970s ch avez was in reality a cuban mole within the venezuelan army for over twenty years chavez gained power gradually in 3 stages chavez took advantage of the discontent and won the only election he ever won fairly in 1998 as chavez did not gain power by force he has to tread carefully and thus initially he did not move towards socialism in the economy he set out to gain total control of the country in three stages stage 1 involved state power he managed changed the constitution to gain control of the judiciary and open the door to reelection until then not allowed by the old constitution in stage 2 he built international alliances by suing the oil income to get friendly leftist elected in neighboring countries thanks to the incredible luck of the price of oil going from 7 barrel to 140 barrel under his watch he was able to make himself important in the world stage giving russia billions in weapons contracts and becoming china s largest customer in south america petrodiplomacy was born in this era he funded extreme leftist parties in latin america spain and other parts of the world stage 3 involved the economy in the beginning he didn t nationalize or confiscate private property his initial approach was cautious this granted him support in the private sector eventually he began to nationalize and confiscate earnestly from 2008 onwards president lopez obrador is a carbon copy mexicans beware mexicans should take notice aslopez obrador is copying chavez to the letter including posing as an economic conservative in the early stages 7 4 million hectares were expropriated by the government active army officers became judges which is unconstitutional labor unions were put under state control leaders who opposed these measures were imprisoned it wasn t until 2007 eight years after initially seizing power that hugo chavez openly referred to himself as communist before that he professed to be a humanist venezuelans are defenseless unlike the us constitution which has a second amendment guaranteeing the right to bear arms and form a militia if the government exceeds its powers in 2008 hugo chavez made sure that there would never be an uprising and stripped venezuelans citizens of their weapons even in their homes through legislation approved in 2007 maduro has continued these policies with disastrous results by 2018 the economy has shrunk by 60 currently milk consumption has fallen 80 and chicken consumption by 75 20 000 cubans are preventing an uprising by the venezuelan military the army s support of maduro is no longer guaranteed they would probably like to take maduro out nevertheless 20 000 cubans loyal the regime are in charge of state security and present in army installations are a threat to any service member who plans rebellion and their families havana fears that if maduro falls those 20 000 cubans cubans could be massacred given the population s anger at the regime yet cuba does not have the logistics to remove its personnel and deliver them home safely thus a major obstacle for the removal of maduro is a solution to the cuban presence juan guaido is the constitutional president juan guaidó is not self proclaimed the venezuelan constitution mandates that the president of the national assembly become president whether he likes it or not if the presidency is vacant as maduro s term expired on january 10th and no legitimate elections had been held the presidency was vacant he automatically became interim president regardless of any proclamation maduro s election was a fraud in order to win the sham presidential election of 2018 in which 80 of venezuelans refused to vote maduro made it illegal for the authentic opposition parties to participate and its main leaders were imprisoned his only opposition was a former minister of chavez his elections were not recognized at that time by most latin america the european union and the united states so on january 10 the us recognized guaidó as the legitimate president a man who four years prior literally took a bullet in his back for confronting the government we are lucky that obama is no longer president the obama administration in conjunction with tom shannon under secretary of state for political affairs approached the venezuela situation by staging endless discussions and dialogues with maduro who they thought would become softer if the us made concessions to cuba the trump administration understands that the maduro regime is a band of thugs they know that talking only buys them more time the venezuelan refugee crisis is reaching syrian proportions so far 15 of the population has left 4 million venezuelans are exiles of which 1 million are refugees in colombia percentage wise there are more venezuelan exiles than cubans according to the brookings institute 4 million more may leave this year which would be equal to or worse than the worst african migratory crisis and worse than the unfolding situation in syria this situation is unique in the americas and could become one of the worst human catastrophes in history if maduro remains in power socialism becomes normalized through culture yet if you read the new york times in 2008 hugo chavez was heralded as the reincarnation of j esus christ due to his funding for social programs these social programs were potemkin villages designed to fool those not doing their research properly just like what is happening in the united states today universities became socialist terrain 40 years ago in venezuela from there these ideas became popular politically libertarian pundits are clueless to compare venezuela with the middle east nowadays the trump administration is providing incredible support to the venezuelan opposition some libertarian pundits are discouraging the us from intervening by equating the situation to iran or iraq they are demonstrating total ignorance of south america and venezuela in particular venezuelan is the most pro american country in the world and has no connection with whatever actions took in central america a century ago caracas was second only to london in the number of american expats in residence for over thirty years in 1997 bill clinton visited the americas and the only city where his security team allowed him to walk freely was caracas he was mobbed by adoring crowds there is no need to invade just provide a show force there is no need for an invasion amere show of force would probably provide the push the army needs to get rid of the cuban handlers in the army barracks people who know nothing about the region should not opine what s next maduro is gone he will not last a year maduro is a cuban prisoner in the palace he has no freedom of movement he no longer has control
hasc testimony 2020 hasc testimony 2021 sasc testimony 2022 hasc testimony 2023 sasc testimony 2023 7 march 2024 statement for the record general michael erik kurilla commander us central command before the house armed services committee on the posture of us central command two visions for the future of the central region i introduction the central region faces its most volatile security situation in the past half century just a year ago the region was on the verge of improbable and transformative progress the strategic investments in our partners were transforming the security calculus in the region in ways unthinkable just ten years ago the vision of an integrated and modernized region was on the precipice of actualization the events of 7 october 2023 not only permanently changed israel and gaza they also set off a series of reactions that have created the conditions for malign actors to sow instability throughout the region and beyond today a convergence of crisis and competition have enabled revisionist powers to fuel violence seeking a return to an unfortunately predictable pattern in the region s history iran and its expansive network of proxies and partners saw a once in a generation opportunity to reshape the region to its advantage they have accelerated their efforts to expel western presence and neutralize our influence in the region enabling a long term strategic goal to further their revolution and establish regional hegemony iran knows that its decades long vision of dominating the region cannot be realized if the region s states continue to expand integration with each other and deepen partnership with the united states isis and al qaeda despite tremendous losses remain committed to inflicting violence and suffering on anyone not aligned with their extremist ideology isis retains the capability to threaten u s interests and is attempting to reconstitute in syria the people s republic of china prc and russia demonstrate that they have little capability or will to reduce regional tensions and are quick to capitalize on instability collectively iran russia and the prc are strengthening their relationship creating a chaotic landscape favorable for their exploitation and the spread of extremism however the region is not predestined to this fate the path of integration and partnership remains open to us if we remain committed to following it the stable future envisioned by our national security strategy nss and national defense strategy nds and shared by our partners can support broader u s national interests and is one worth striving to achieve despite iran s best efforts the region is holding open its doors to security cooperation with the united states it is modernizing at an incredible rate seeking to shake free from the turmoil of its past and looking towards a future of security stability and prosperity our partners in the levant arabian gulf and central and south asia remain committed to advancing the region preferably with the united states the degree of u s investment across the instruments of national power and the success of security integration in the central region will be decisive in determining whether its future supports u s national interests our years of continuous engagement throughout the region serve as the foundation for this investment u s central command s strategic approach of people partners and innovation codified in our theater strategy reinforces the vision of a modern and integrated central region and supports a whole of government effort to secure our regional and global interests our strategic advantage in the region remains strong military to military partnerships while our adversaries and competitors rely on parasitic and transactional relationships we seek to integrate our partners while iran seeks to leverage instability to its advantage we enable our partners to defeat violent extremists by catalyzing unified responses while iran threatens national sovereignty and regional stability by supporting and enabling sectarian militias in concert with our partners we drive innovative approaches concepts and technologies to address the many threats we face developing solutions for real time decision advantage and creating strategic depth in our force posture uscentcom is clear eyed about the task before us the shockwaves of the past year will reverberate across the central region for some time iran intends to seize on its opportunity and it will not be easily deterred the fight against violent extremism is not complete the prc and russia will exploit instability at every turn to undermine u s interests and advance their own strategic positions beyond the region we acknowledge there are a myriad of global challenges that require deliberate risk and resourcing decisions by our national leaders uscentcom remains committed to the vision of a prosperous and integrated central region in which u s national interests are advanced ii strategic context the central region remains vital to our national interests uscentcom protects the security of the american people and supports the expansion of american economic prosperity and opportunity we benefit from deep diplomatic ties and military to military relationships throughout the uscentcom area of responsibility aor with many of the united states most steadfast partners resident in the region or astride it we also have critical economic interests to protect the arabian gulf contains around 800 billion barrels of proven oil reserves and 2 800 trillion cubic feet of natural gas reserves nearly half the world s oil and natural gas twelve percent of our imported oil comes from the region and it supplies the world with 15 million barrels per day much of which goes to our global partners and allies through the strait of hormuz many of the resources that do not originate in the region traverse it along shipping routes between asia and europe passing through strategic chokepoints in the bab al mandeb strait and suez canal there are also significant security challenges in the region from iran s regional hegemonic ambitions to the world s biggest concentration of violent extremism the security of america s homeland its interests and the security of our partners are under threat from an array of actors seeking to prevent the vision of a free and prosperous central region from coming to fruition we must ensure malign actors do not proliferate regional violence around the globe and to our shores we must also be cognizant that our partners are weighing their options as they interpret signals that suggest we will reduce our commitment meanwhile the burgeoning military relationship between russia and iran threatens to amplify their activities across multiple theaters uscentcom secures u s national interests and addresses these destabilizing influences through three lines of effort deterring iran countering violent extremist organizations and competing strategically deterring iran for several decades tehran has pursued a three pronged strategy for regional dominance achieve a threshold nuclear weapons capability advance and proliferate its standoff weapons arsenal and leverage a vast proxy network to sow instability throughout the region it is that proxy network known as the iranian threat network itn that provides iran operational reach throughout the region and enables its 5 offensive actions against our regional partners and global interests iran continues to use its nuclear program for international blackmail last year iran continued to produce and stockpile highly enriched uranium well beyond what is needed for civilian purposes in hopes of gaining economic concessions from the international community on 10 february 2024 the international atomic energy agency announced iran had amassed a 121 5 kilogram stockpile of 60 enriched uranium and 5 525 5 kilograms of enriched uranium overall should iran decide it could enrich enough uranium for three nuclear devices within weeks a nuclear armed iran would transform the region overnight and forever likely igniting a regional race for nuclear weapons and creating a security umbrella for its hegemonic ambitions iran also projects power through its ballistic missiles unmanned aerial systems uas and other advanced conventional weapons over the last 12 months iran continued to expand its arsenal of precision guided weapon systems including ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges up to 2000km and one way attack uas with ranges up to 3000km these capabilities enable iran to strike every country in the central region and to range key u s allies as far away as europe iran distributes many of these weapons to proxies in the region presenting a high end multi axis threat to u s forces and those of our allies and partners iran s advanced weapons have been used by its proxies in lebanon iraq syria and yemen continuously in the past five months and they continue their illicit shipments in violation of un sanctions on a daily basis finally hamas s barbaric attack on israel would not have been possible without years of iranian material and training support not only does iran actively undermine the sovereignty of neighboring states in the region by providing sophisticated lethal aid to its various militias it also supplies countries like russia venezuela and sudan with attack and surveillance uas with more customers lining up globally regardless of who pulls the trigger iran is unconcerned with ensuring its weapons are employed in accordance with the law of armed conflict iran displays its growing uas capabilities by attacking commercial shipping striking merchant vessels more than 1 000 nautical miles into the indian ocean in fact since 2021 iran attacked or seized 19 merchant ships in international waters and still illegally holds five vessels and their crews against their will in iranian ports tehran has long driven instability in the region with its proxies but 2023 saw an unprecedented activation of virtually every facet of the itn across the entire region after hamas attacked israel the houthis in yemen targeted the global economy iranian aligned militia groups iamg waged a campaign of violence to force the global coalition to defeat isis out of iraq and syria and lebanese hezbollah s increasingly escalatory attacks held israel s northern border at risk iran saw an opportunity to demonstrate the capabilities of its so called axis of resistance and manifested decades of conditioning provisioning and preparation since 7 october 2023 iamgs like kata ib hezbollah and harakat al nujaba enabled by iran s islamic revolutionary guard corps qods force have attacked coalition forces 71 times in iraq 102 times in syria and twice in jordan killing three u s servicemembers on 28 january 2024 the houthis have attacked international shipping and coalition warships over 50 times sparking supply chain issues reminiscent of those during the covid 19 pandemic and contributing to food aid delays in hunger stricken yemen through the itn the proliferation of its ballistic missile and uas capabilities and the potential of nuclear breakout iran is executing a strategic encirclement of the region they are emplacing forces ideology and weapon systems that can threaten us interests allies and partners from multiple vectors and at critical chokepoints with littleto no warning now more than ever tehran has the capability to advance its regional goals and threaten global interests houthi attacks threaten the free flow of 15 of the world s commerce while iran itself repeatedly attacks and seizes international merchant vessels iamg attacks and iranian political pressure jeopardize the hard earned gains of the global coalition to defeat isis iran s proliferation of advanced conventional weapons fuels conflict on three continents all of this is underscored by iran s status as a threshold nuclear state with conditions now set we assess tehran perceives an opportunity to force the u s out of the central region divide its neighbors and take substantive steps to eradicate the state of israel opportunities for deterring iran in line with the nss and nds uscentcom leverages the united states unparalleled ability to integrate partners in pursuit of mutual interests uscentcom s role is gradually shifting from security guarantor to security integrator and many of our regional partners are increasingly willing to coordinate with their neighbors to enhance the defense of their borders behind this trend is a growing recognition that iran is their greatest threat in response we develop competitive overmatch among our partners by enhancing our collective capabilities and leveraging our network of regional security constructs middle east air defense mead is an example as the regional integration of our partners air defense capabilities has helped detect and intercept the 8 unprecedented wave of missile and uas attacks coming from the itn multinational coordination mechanisms aligned against individual domains such as the international maritime security construct imsc help to address specific iranian threats like illegal ship seizures and arms smuggling even groups designed to counter other threats such as the global coalition to defeat isis and the 41 nation combined maritime forces cmf bring the world together in common cause to defend the rulesbased international order which iran is actively working to undermine we must continue to strengthen our longstanding bilateral military to military relationships just as our partners count on our support we depend on our partners a more effective foreign military sales fms program will underwrite the trust among our partners and help bolster their capabilities relative to iran as well as protect their own sovereignty beyond materiel contributions to any fighting force our close partnerships enable access basing and overflight that will be critical to mission success for example our close relationship with egypt allowed us unique access to expedite humanitarian aid at the outset of the sudanese civil war in addition to our daily operations going forward we must continue to develop the partner enabled western access network which provides alternate routes to transport equipment and personnel throughout the uscentcom aor you cannot surge trust in crisis and our partners must know we are there for them before we need something in return risks to deterring iran iran believes it has the momentum to force a premature withdrawal of the global coalition to defeat isis allowing them opportunity to expand its land bridge to the 9 mediterranean sea and revive the narrative of abandonment in the region further the prc and russia would undoubtedly capitalize in the information environment by characterizing our withdrawal as a demonstration of american unreliability hoping to drive a wedge in our global partnerships and assault a core premise of the nds and nss iran s potential pursuit of a nuclear weapon could significantly alter our risk assessment preventing iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon remains a top priority with global implications while we have not seen indications that iran s supreme leader has changed his calculus to pursue a nuclear weapon we will continue to develop military options for the secretary of defense and president should they be necessary countering violent extremist organizations veo five years after the fall of the territorial defeat of isis the group s extremist ideology endures it endures in more than 5 000 fighters and operatives still at large throughout the central region and beyond it endures in detention facilities guarded by our syrian democratic forces sdf partners which hold approximately 9 000 detainees finally it endures in pockets of camps for displaced persons like syria s al hol which currently holds approximately 43 000 men women and children isis remains resolute in its quest to plunge the region into sectarian violence impose its ideology and eventually spread its influence globally without the global coalition s continued focus isis resurgence remains a threat in 2023 combined joint task force operation inherent resolve cjtf oir conducted 475 total ground operations and 45 total airstrikes resulting in 164 isis fighters killed 10 and 619 detained we assess our high volume of partnered operations has kept isis at bay however iamg attacks on u s and coalition forces degrade the d isis campaign eliminating isis s ability to conduct terrorist attacks requires sustained investment in iraqi security forces partners on the ground in syria and a robust counterterrorism apparatus consisting of intelligence community and interagency elements the barrage of iranian sponsored attacks after 17 october 2023 forced cjtf oir to come off plan as we prioritized protecting our forces in iraq and syria the ensuing spike in isis attacks demonstrates the gravity of disruptions to the international effort to permanently defeat the group in the first two weeks of 2024 isis conducted 275 attacks in iraq and syria the highest rate of attacks in the last two years the government of iraq is rightly concerned that isis is taking advantage of the global coalition temporarily letting up due to iamg attacks furthermore tehran is exerting incredible political pressure on baghdad to expel the coalition which would all but guarantee isis return if it occurred before iraqi security forces isf were ready to stand on their own we would also be challenged to support our syrian partners without a military presence in iraq in syria we saw isis increase intensity of activity across multiple provinces as it enjoyed more freedom of movement due to sdf conflicts with local tribes and turkish airstrikes that restricted sdf operations a spate of isis attacks in late 2023 drove up the annual average casualties per attack to twice the rate of the previous year disruptions in syria also forced temporary delays in training security forces for detention facilities and displaced persons camps we must ensure the sdf can sustainably hold isis detainees while the international community repatriates foreign 11 fighters in addition to training guards we assist with the maintenance and refurbishment of the detention facilities to eliminate vulnerabilities isis may exploit in attempts to free detainees we also train our partner forces in syria many of whom are women to provide security at the displaced persons camps the training is key to keeping the residents safe enabling access for aid organizations and preventing the spread of extremism nonetheless the longer that displaced persons remain in camps like al hol and al ro the more susceptible they are to isis ideology making their reintegration into society more difficult alongside our partners we continue to identify and detain isis facilitators operating in the camps to prevent the next generation of isis the international community must sustain the recent momentum in repatriating and reintegrating displaced persons in their home countries our central and south asian partners repeatedly share their concern over isis pursuit of opportunity and capability to conduct external operations the taliban targeted some key isis khorasan isis k leaders in 2023 but it has shown neither the capability nor the intent to sustain adequate counterterrorism pressure in fact this lack of sustained pressure allowed isis k to regenerate and harden their networks creating multiple redundant nodes that direct enable and inspire attacks additionally the taliban has shown little interest to apply counter terrorism pressure against the tehrik e taliban pakistan ttp presenting a significant threat to stability in pakistan s border regions we do not expect that dynamic to change these groups have leveraged poor economic conditions lax governance in 12 afghanistan and a sophisticated network to recruit train and sustain an expanding cadre of fighters tragically even as iran undermines the global coalition in iraq and syria isis k killed 91 iranians and injured 284 others in kerman on 3 january 2024 this was the deadliest terror attack in iran since 1979 and it is part of isis efforts to exploit the war in gaza to rejuvenate its global attacks in retaliation iran further destabilized the region by carrying out strikes in pakistan iraq and syria drawing harsh condemnation from both pakistani and iraqi governments and reportedly causing civilian casualties in two of these incidents al qaeda while weakened still enjoys safe havens in afghanistan and yemen al qaeda in the indian subcontinent aqis operates training camps safehouses and religious schools in afghanistan al qaeda in the arabian peninsula aqap launched a counter offensive against republic of yemen government forces in september 2023 likely to regain access to historically supportive areas in the southern governorates both aqis and aqap continue to call for lone wolf attacks on u s and western interests via their global digital reach opportunities to counter veos the enduring defeat of isis depends not only on the repatriation and reintegration of displaced persons from camps like al hol and al roj but the repatriation and prosecution of isis detainees as well and our efforts to encourage this process gained traction in 2023 the international community repatriated 6 396 displaced persons from syria helping to reduce the population of al hol the largest of the camps by 18 iraq and 13 syria led the way on repatriating their citizens while nations like the kyrgyz republic also set the example conducting 333 repatriations in 2023 the government of iraq stepped up its efforts to shorten the average stay in its rehabilitation centers like jeddah 1 which hold returning citizens until they can be reintegrated into society this is also a moral imperative in my six visits to al hol i have met adolescent children who arrived in the camp as infants our partners in iraq and syria including iraq s counterterrorism service and the syrian democratic forces continue to demonstrate improving capability capacity competency and will in 2023 the isf conducted five independent d isis operations without coalition assistance funding mechanisms like the counter isis train and equip fund ctef are key to sustaining this progress and fully transitioning iraq s security to iraqi hands in august 2023 the d isis mission in iraq took a major step forward when the u s and iraqi governments agreed at the joint security cooperation dialogue to form a higher military commission hmc a consultative mechanism for the coalition s transition the hmc will enable the transition to an enduring bilateral security partnership between iraq and the united states on a timeline that factors in the threat from isis operational and environmental requirements and the capability of the isf cjtf oir in lockstep with nato mission iraq will continue to train and develop the isf until it is fully capable of independent operations in central and south asia we can partner with countries like pakistan tajikistan and others to help them address the growing threat from the deteriorating security 14 situation in afghanistan our partners in the region consistently cite counterterrorism as one of their highest priorities for cooperation and combined training risks to countering veos despite gains in the counter veo fight various groups in the central region retain the capability and will to target u s interests abroad in under six months with little to no warning we assess an attack on american soil would likely take longer the reprioritization of intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr assets targeting expertise and linguists contributes to gaps and seams in our ability to detect and disrupt plots increasing freedom of movement for veos this could be partially mitigated by additional assets and cooperation with our central and south asian partners taliban pressure against isis k temporarily disrupted the group s ability to plan and conduct attacks against the homeland and western targets but that pressure has been intermittent isis k and its allies retain a safe haven in afghanistan and they continue to develop their networks in and out of the country their goals do not stop there they have called for attacks globally on anyone not aligned with their extremist ideology and taliban efforts to suppress the group have proven insufficient the recent isis attack in kerman iran demonstrates the group s resiliency and indicates that they retain the capability and will to conduct spectacular external operations safe havens like afghanistan also increase the risk of veos inciting regional conflict veos killed at least 2 300 pakistanis in 2023 with ttp attacking pakistan 881 times the highest rate in over five years in addition to hundreds of attacks by ttp isis k conducted at least three high profile bombings in pakistan in 2023 and plotted to conduct 15 more attacks throughout central asia the taliban s inability or unwillingness to rein in veos could destabilize central and south asia we must also prevent a premature coalition departure from iraq and syria if iran and russia were to succeed in their goal of pushing us out before our partner forces can operate independently it is my assessment that isis would reconstitute the ability to seize territory within two years the global coalition s sustained presence not only helps our partners in their fight against isis it also prevents the reemergence of territorial control and ensures the group does not have a safe haven in iraq or syria to plan global attacks the eventual transition to a traditional security cooperation framework must be predicated on partner force development and security sector reform in iraq and continued repatriations secure detention facilities and a political pathway for the sdf in syria competing strategically strategic competition is a contest of visions the united states and our partners promote a vision in which the rules based international order respects the sovereignty of nations and shared interests are advanced through the strength of partnership the prc russia and iran have deepened their partnership and collaboration as iran seeks to strengthen its regional position russia leverages iranian military support in ukraine and the prc aims to exploit tensions in the region to afford them a position of advantage and diminishes us interests according to public reporting supreme leader khamenei said in november 2023 that death to america is not just a slogan it is a policy the prc and russia increasingly contribute to iran s goals through direct assistance or 16 refusing to apply their own instruments of national power to discourage iran s malign behaviors for nearly eighty years since president roosevelt met with king ibn saud aboard uss quincy the united states has formed a network of hard earned security partnerships with the central region these partnerships are more than just objects to be guarded from competitors like the prc and russia they must be nurtured and reinforced our partnerships are strategic high ground and represent a core strength of the united states this is evidenced by our rapid response to recent trade disruptions caused by houthi attacks in the red sea the u s fifth fleet leveraged its decadeslong relationships under cmf to bring together more than 20 nations under operation prosperity guardian which protects shipping through the critical bab al mandeb strait in response to the houthis indiscriminate attacks no other nation on earth could generate an international response so quickly and it would not have been possible without the trust and interoperability we have fostered among our allies and partners our partnerships in the central region will become even more valuable as the transformation toward modernization and prosperity continues our partners want the united states to be part of this transformation and our competitors know this in 2023 the kingdom of saudi arabia ksa continued to diversify its economy exemplified by western tourists strolling through massive shopping centers in riyadh and ambitious megaprojects while remaining dedicated to seeking peaceful coexistence with its neighbors the united arab emirates uae catapulted itself to global prominence in space sending an astronaut to the international space station for six months and providing the world with a new map of mars from its hope spacecraft the second probe 17 ever to successfully enter mars orbit on its first try just a few months earlier in november 2022 qatar hosted the world s largest sporting event the fifa world cup for the first time ever in the central region american engagement has contributed to this transformation and the central region of the future will remain open to those who continue to help it strategic competition with the people s republic of china with telecommunications and physical infrastructure diplomacy and security cooperation the prc is rapidly penetrating the central region and feeds misperceptions of american disengagement to try to supplant the united states as the security partner of choice in late october 2023 the prc s outgoing naval escort task force netf which ostensibly counters piracy in the gulf of aden on rotational deployments since 2008 visited kuwait qatar uae and pakistan before departing the theater this unprecedented series of port calls was a milestone in the prc s nascent campaign to gain security influence and access the term security partner means something very different to the prc than it does to the united states the prc offers discounted sales and rapid delivery of military equipment and the region is learning the hidden cost associated with these quick sales when chinese equipment performs poorly there is no maintenance logistics or training architecture in place furthermore the prc shows no desire to support the region s security or stability with military forces for example the prc s netf in the gulf of aden has done nothing in the defense of international shipping under houthi attack nor has it responded to the recent series of piracy events in the somali basin instead solely 18 focusing on the protection of chinese assets and interests meanwhile the prc has also done little to rein in iran s destabilizing behavior since the much touted rapprochement it brokered between tehran and riyadh in march 2023 unfortunately perhaps as evidence of the lack of depth of the arrangement and tepid commitment towards actual stability iran has continued its illicit activities including continued arming of the houthis it is noteworthy that the prc buys 90 of exported iranian oil which they could use to influence iranian lethal aid to the houthis if they chose to instead beijing only helps tehran evade sanctions and accelerate its destabilization of the region the prc s unwillingness or inability to leverage its influence has contributed to iran s disruption of the free flow of international commerce the central region is vital to the prc achieving its goal of refashioning the international system to suit its interests and authoritarian preferences and become the world s leading power increased cooperation between the prc and the central region advances its belt and road projects strengthens bilateral relations and helps regional countries diversify their economies trade between the prc and the central region surpassed 436 billion in 2022 and its investments in the region under the belt and road continued apace in 2023 with projects in telecommunications construction transportation and more a key element of the belt and road seeks to create overland shipping routes between the prc and europe through central and south asia which could bolster regional economies but also carries risk for example pakistan is the world s third largest recipient of chinese loans behind russia and venezuela receiving over 67 19 billion to fund the china pakistan economic corridor now amid its ongoing economic crisis pakistan is vulnerable to prc influence we have also seen an incremental increase in beijing s political investment in the region in the past two years bahrain egypt kuwait ksa qatar and uae became dialogue partners in the shanghai cooperation organization while iran joined as a full member last year this year egypt uae and iran formally joined brics we now routinely see people s liberation army pla general officers serving as senior defense officials sdo or defense attachés whereas just a few years ago these would have been mid grade officers the prc relies on the region for its energy importing 56 of its crude oil and 43 of natural gas from uscentcom aor countries the india middle east europe economic corridor imec announced last year by president biden along with six other countries and the european union offers a promising counterbalance to the prc s belt and road uscentcom s military to military relationships can provide critical and timely insight on projects that could be incorporated into imec time and time again our partners tell us they would prefer to contract with u s or western companies if a viable option were available we are at risk of deterioration in our strategic relationships and losing influence to beijing in the central region if we cannot effectively assist our partners with their security needs our partners recognize the superior quality of our military equipment but as the advent of drone warfare has demonstrated even a third rate product employed rapidly and in large quantities can be effective we must improve our processes to 20 outperform competitors like the prc who has increased arms sales to the region in the last decade we are also monitoring the potential expansion of pla basing in the central region beyond their current naval base in djibouti and border outpost in tajikistan if the prc were to secure additional pla naval bases it could give them the ability to hold our strategic lines of communication at risk even in ports where they have no intention of establishing a naval base chinese state owned enterprises that own or operate terminals could give them considerable political influence to present us with logistical challenges in a future conflict strategic competition with russia russia s goals in the central region are different from those of the prc but they are no less intent on diminishing american influence in the region russia s primary security interests in the region are maintaining its access in syria preserving its legacy soviet status in central asia and developing its military cooperation with iran russia s two largest foreign bases are in tajikistan and syria both in the uscentcom aor further demonstrating the region s importance to russia vladimir putin s only international visits since he launched the invasion of ukraine outside of the prc iran and central asia were to ksa and uae over the past year the collaboration between russia and iran grew into a nascent military partnership iran has delivered at least 1 000 attack drones and dozens of multipurpose uas to russia for use in ukraine with iran s help russia plans to build 6 000 uas domestically by 2025 after un sanctions on iran s missile program expired 21 in october 2023 russia now intends to purchase hundreds of iranian ballistic missiles in the coming months significantly increasing the risk of prolonging its war in ukraine in return russia agreed to supply iran with its advanced su 35 fighter jets attack helicopters and training aircraft our partners in central asia observed russia s unprovoked invasions of ukraine and georgia and its military s subsequent performance raising doubts about its reliability as a security partner furthermore the lack of intervention by the russian led collective security treaty organization in the conflict between armenia and azerbaijan despite multiple armenian requests underscored the ineffectiveness of the alliance among the central asian states many of whom are members as a result uscentcom has a generational opportunity to strengthen and expand our partnerships with kazakhstan the kyrgyz republic tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan we also have the opportunity to support u s european command by coordinating across theater boundaries when russia uses the central region to evade sanctions or transport illicit war materiel we can work with willing partners to frustrate its logistics in addition when we seize lethal aid that iran smuggles to its proxies throughout the region and when authorized by applicable law we will work with the interagency to transfer it to our ukrainian partners just as we did with 1 1 million rounds of seized rifle ammunition in october 2023 the growing military relationship between russia and iran is expanding to new domains apart from iran s proliferation of advanced weaponry with no export controls or end use monitoring they are also cooperating in cyber and space in march 2023 22 russia sent iran digital surveillance software and tehran is seeking more assistance as of december 2023 the two countries are reportedly on the verge of signing a new long term comprehensive cooperation agreement covering defense energy and space sectors russia welcomed syria s reinstatement into the arab league in 2023 which boosted the status of one of its key regional partners while simultaneously ramping up pressure for the d isis coalition s withdrawal syria s reinstatement was a lifeline for assad who has depended on a mixture of russian and iranian support and funding from drug smuggling to sustain his regime additionally russia s continued irresponsible and unprofessional behavior in syrian airspace and on the electromagnetic spectrum needlessly raise the risk of miscalculation iii strategic approach uscentcom seizes the opportunities and mitigates the risks that arise in the central region through our strategic approach people partners and innovation my first two years in command reinforced the value of these three pillars we ve outlined this approach in our theater strategy new campaign plan and our approach to current operations our approach aligns with the 2022 nds which is a call to action to incorporate our unparalleled network of allies and partners uscentcom will continue this approach as a security integrator in the region people our people our servicemembers civilian workforce contractors and supportive families serve as the bedrock of everything we do they are our greatest asset and our 23 most critical resource our goal is to instill in them a sense of accomplishment purpose identity and belonging we recognize that the top talent in the workforce both in and out of uniform have many options as an actively engaged combatant command we require the best but also develop and cultivate expertise so that the best want to work here we seek to attract and retain premier talent to meet our evolving needs for example we hired a team of experts to critically analyze our operations to ensure we do everything possible to preserve innocent life in line with the department s guidance to mitigate civilian harm we also maintain a cadre of interagency liaisons to support a whole of government strategy in the region such as our usaid team that enables us to support humanitarian aid and disaster relief missions our partners see the professionalism of our service members as we engage with them on a daily basis and seek to emulate their example through investment in reforms across their military formations our non commissioned officer nco corps is the envy of all other militaries and we are working with many of our partners across the central region to build world class nco development and education systems in central asia particularly our partners are increasingly seeking our help with nco development as we have done with kazakhstan over the past 30 years our people are not just in our headquarters and in our subordinate commands but across the enterprise that supports our operations activities and investments in the central region reductions over time such as rank reductions in our defense attaché positions and reallocation of analytical support across the intelligence community have a 24 cumulative effect as necessary and logical resourcing decisions have been made to reprioritize assets against other emergent challenges risk accumulates over time if cuts are made too quickly or deeply much like blocks being removed from a jenga tower the impact may not be obvious at first but eventually the tower will fall finally we are committed to bringing on individuals who can help accelerate innovation in uscentcom in addition to our chief technology officer last year we hired our first chief data officer and an ai robotics advisor both of whom will enable our digital modernization and shift toward data centric operations we then initiated our technology residency program in january of this year the program will bring in exceptional talent from across the industrial base throughout the year to support us on a three to six month timeline the residents will partner with elements of uscentcom staff and components to help tackle the friction points we encounter in our experimentation aid in our data modernization efforts and contribute key skillsets that are not organic to the department of defense partners both the nss and nds emphasize the importance of partnership the trusted relationships we have built with our partners over decades give us an advantage over competitors like the prc and russia and sustaining that advantage is key to our strategic approach in the central region we help our partners achieve competitive overmatch versus iran and suppress veos through security integration and dependable cooperation such as timely fms and foreign military financing our fight against isis depends on multilateral constructs like nato mission iraq and 25 cjtf oir and on our bilateral partnerships in iraq and syria our coalition remains in iraq at the invitation of the government the government of iraq faces immense pressure from iran to withdraw its invitation for coalition presence but they have resisted external manipulation thus far even holding their first provincial elections in a decade in december 2023 iraq is committed to cooperating with the united states reforming its security sector and realizing the full development of the isf which made strides in 2023 we are planning for an orderly transition to a normalized military to military relationship featuring traditional security cooperation in syria the sdf remain committed to the enduring defeat of isis in detention facilities in displaced persons camps and at large despite facing an existential threat and pressure from the assad regime our relationships with the militaries of the levant region helped keep hamas attack on israel from spiraling into a wider regional conflict we have stood side by side with israel ensuring it has what it needs to defend itself deter iran and its proxies like lebanese hezbollah from getting further involved and plan for a transition to postconflict close coordination with our counterparts in egypt jordan and lebanon allowed us to expedite the flow of humanitarian aid and facilitate safe operations for organizations like the un interim force in lebanon our partners in the levant also contribute valuable forces and expertise to regional security constructs like mead and cmf integrating the security efforts of our gulf cooperation council gcc partners is the linchpin of our strategy to deter iranian aggression gcc members are moving toward operational coordination in the defense of their territorial airspace and waters bilaterally and via multilateral constructs like mead cmf and imsc specifically ksa is enabling interoperability by transforming its ministry of defense to mirror the u s model more 26 closely for national defense qatar s air force contributes aircraft to our daily operations throughout the region the uae just completed its second company level rotation to our joint readiness training center with the goal of fielding a brigade completely interoperable with u s forces by 2028 together the gcc countries can stand strong against iran still the strategic importance of the gcc goes beyond any singular adversary gcc countries host the u s fifth fleet in bahrain the headquarters for cjtf oir in kuwait and our theater air operations center and the largest u s military base in the region in qatar the gulf is also home to the region s economic power centers in ksa and uae and the diplomatic efforts of partners like qatar and oman have helped resolve multiple crises and return american citizens home safely in september 2023 uscentcom held its central and south asian chiefs of defense conference in uzbekistan for the first time in two years an indication of our steadily growing relationships our central asian partners are cautiously optimistic about the prospect of increased security cooperation especially border defense counterterrorism institutional capacity building and military medicine we are also beginning more advanced training like cybersecurity and special operations with some partners with the region s strategic location between iran afghanistan the prc and russia this momentum in our military to military relationships is invaluable to our national security but it also places constraints on our partners we intend to continue cooperation via programs like international military education and training and the state partnership program at a pace with which our central asian partners are individually comfortable 27 in south asia pakistan has had a deep and multi faceted strategic partnership with the prc since the 1960s ties between the two countries deepened further in the early 2000 s as the two countries developed shared concerns about the rise of india as a regional power since 2015 nearly 75 of pakistani arms imports came from the prc which represents 40 of chinese arms exports making pakistan beijing s largest security customer nevertheless pakistan seeks u s security and economic assistance considering the weight that pakistan carries throughout asia we must approach our relationship from the perspective of its own merits any security strategy in afghanistan will require pakistan s help they have invaluable expertise access and geographic location for countering isis k and they are willing and capable counterterrorism partners as they face persistent threats from veos like ttp finally our global partners provide invaluable contributions to uscentcom operations in support of our mutual interests our five eyes partners australia canada united kingdom and new zealand share intelligence and commit forces across all three of our lines of effort in addition france continues to be a ready and willing military partner in defeating isis countering russia and deterring iranian aggressive action at sea innovation in uscentcom we are not just experimenting with new technologies we are developing innovative processes building innovative teams while encouraging individual contributions and responding to emerging threats in innovative ways importantly our personnel use the capabilities that we are developing in real world operations today we 28 are helping to create america s military of the future not waiting for it uscentcom has implemented a wide range of mechanisms and processes to drive innovation the combined joint all domain command and control cjadc2 software suite uscentcom employs today is drastically different from the c2 systems used in counterinsurgency operations of the past twenty years the persistent and multidomain threat created by iran s ongoing proliferation of advanced weaponry to its proxies necessitates decision making tools that enable seamless command and control functions from the tactical to the strategic level in real time the importance of speed and a holistic approach in seeing understanding and acting cannot be overstated the cjadc2 software suite we have tested and now use daily enabled us to thwart numerous itn attacks this momentum must be continued and accelerated through the combatant commands under the department s strategy these efforts are complementary to ongoing work across the department and we have hosted senior officials from across the entire enterprise to share our lessons learned and help the joint force modernize since january 2023 we have conducted a series of quarterly digital exercises preceded by month long software sprints to develop the tools needed for cjadc2 cjadc2 is more than just a concept for us it is a daily activity that we are improving with each exercise by pairing operators with software developers we are proving that we can use digital tools to improve our situational awareness make our targeting more efficient and effective improve our planning and sustainment processes and embody true digital warfighting exercises like these demonstrate the value of hands on training with live data and the centrality of robust networks in cjadc2 we nest our exercises 29 and experimentation under dod efforts such as the global information dominance experiment series in addition to quarterly cjadc2 exercises we have driven other events to encourage innovative thinking and solutions in 2023 we continued our innovation oasis a shark tank style competition open to the entire uscentcom enterprise the winning ideas are rapidly introduced to the force such as an intuitive software tool for managing force flow into theater that won last year s competition and is already in use across the command this is indicative of how we look for innovative responses to our most pressing challenges for the counter uas problem we developed a series of tailored sands exercises to address the problem s many unique aspects and established an integrated experimentation center in ksa where we can test the newest technology alongside our partners another example is cybersecurity in 2023 we held a best cyber warrior competition in oman exercises and training events with our partners in rapidly developing fields like counter uas and cybersecurity are key to establishing regional competitive overmatch versus iran we also organized our subordinate commands to encourage innovation with each now operating an innovation task force tailored to their unique domain on land task force 39 is experimenting with additive manufacturing counter uas technologies and unmanned logistics vehicles at sea task force 59 has not only revolutionized how the u s navy incorporates robotic and ai systems but now contributes daily to regional maritime security and encourages partner investments in unmanned surface and subsurface vehicles last 30 year we launched operation gatekeeper the largest operational employment of multinational unmanned surface vessels in the world gatekeeper allows us and our partners to not only increase maritime domain awareness across 18 000 square kilometers in the north arabian sea but unlike an operation with manned assets it enables continuous presence in the air task force 99 is testing a wide range of new technologies to expand our air superiority including long endurance isr platforms that can fly for days and low cost 3d printed uas some built for as little as 3 000 in eight hours task force 99 is also experimenting with new tools for expeditionary aviation logistics and exploring new ways to detect and counter jamming our special operations innovation task force tf 179 is developing digital and unmanned solutions for isr target information sharing electronic warfare and payload delivery for example tf 179 takes advantage of ussocom s rapid acquisition capabilities to field disposable swarming unmanned systems that can be employed unilaterally or through a surrogate force for one way attack electronic warfare or tactical isr iv conclusion the united states cannot just articulate a vision of integration and partnership for a brighter future that aligns the interests of the united states and our partners we must match that vision with the commitment necessary to give partners the confidence to continue on that path with us there is a narrative that the central region is too fraught with turmoil to be considered worthy of american investment twenty plus years of 31 american military engagement in both iraq and afghanistan play to this narrative but the past while it may serve as prologue does not predetermine the future the vision the hopes and the ambitions of our partners throughout the central region are palpable and they are real equally real are those recidivist forces attempting to undermine those who seek progress pulling them back into a past checkered with violence and disorder we are and should remain engaged in every corner of the central region from egypt to kazakhstan and from lebanon to pakistan strengthening our partners and securing our vital national interests our soldiers sailors airmen marines guardians and coast guardsmen are executing critical operations that contribute to the collective security of the us and our partners they operate in harm s way each day whether it is an f 15 pilot flying missions in support of our iraqi partners the uss carney patrolling the red sea and defeating houthi attacks a patriot battery protecting our forces and those of our partners a marine task force ready to respond to crisis a u s space force detachment combatting adversary attempts at jamming or a u s coast guard boarding team interdicting a shipment of iranian weapons the women and men of u s central command remain committed to the vision of a stable central region in which u s national interests are secure and our partners prosper

calgary alberta march 12 2019 globe newswire ces energy solutions corp ces or the company tsx ceu otc nasdaq intl cesdf is pleased to report on its financial and operating results for the three and twelve months ended december 31 2018 further ces announced today that it will pay a cash dividend of 0 005 per common share on april 15 2019 to the shareholders of record at the close of business on march 29 2019 q4 2018 and 2018 annual revenue of 347 9 million and 1 3 billion respectively were both record quarterly and annual results for the company further the company achieved adjusted ebitdac of 42 1 million and 167 6 million for the three and twelve months ended december 31 2018 respectively which represents increases over both prior year respective periods revenue generated in the us increased 34 and 30 to 239 8 million and 847 8 million for the three and twelve months ended december 31 2018 respectively over the 2017 comparative periods both q4 2018 and annual 2018 revenue generated in the us are the highest us revenues in the company s history exceeding the previous records of 227 1 million in q3 2018 and annual revenue of 652 0 million in 2017 the year over year increase in us revenues was enabled by ces completed investments in us infrastructure and capabilities to date significant activity improvement in the drilling fluids business and increased production chemical related us treatment points particularly in the permian basin for q4 2018 the company s us source revenues were also positively impacted on translation by weakness in the canadian dollar versus us dollar compared to q4 2017 revenue generated in canada increased 8 and 12 to 108 2 million and 423 2 million for the three and twelve months ended december 31 2018 respectively over the 2017 comparative periods purechem contributed the majority of this gain for the three and twelve months ended december 31 2018 compared to the comparative periods in prior year as investments in purechem infrastructure are largely complete and have enabled increased market share in canada in the production chemicals business despite reasonable industry conditions in the first nine months of 2018 drilling activity in canada in q4 2018 was negatively impacted by heightened market uncertainty around lack of current oil and gas takeaway capacity and the resulting record price differentials as a result oil and gas operators pared back capital spending and drilling programs in q4 2018 negatively impacting revenues in ces canadian drilling fluids business in canada for the three months ended december 31 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 in q4 2018 ces recorded gross margin of 69 7 million or 20 0 of revenue compared to gross margin of 67 6 million or 24 2 of revenue generated in q4 2017 annual gross margin totaled 284 3 million compared to 249 8 million for the twelve months ended december 31 2017 representing an increase of 34 5 million or 14 in q4 2018 ces recorded gross margin excluding depreciation of 81 3 million or 23 4 of revenue compared to gross margin excluding depreciation of 78 2 million or 28 1 of revenue generated in q4 2017 annual gross margin excluding depreciation totaled 325 6 million compared to 287 9 million for the twelve months ended december 31 2017 representing an increase of 37 7 million or 13 ces faced cost inflation throughout 2018 which has outpaced the combination of ces operating leverage gains and ability to pass through its input costs to its customers for its products and services further the decline in drilling activity due to the challenges facing the oil and gas industry in canada during q4 2018 negatively affected gross margin as activity levels declined and corresponding lower revenue was over the same fixed cost base as a result gross margin excluding depreciation as a percentage of revenue in q4 2018 has decreased from q4 2017 ces believes that going forward margins may benefit from increased sales in areas such as the permian and the deep basin realization of savings from recent canadian headcount reductions increased operating leverage from its expanded infrastructure completed in 2018 and from our innovative technologies and superior service culture net income for the three and twelve months ended december 31 2018 was 15 5 million and 47 7 million respectively compared to 2 7 million and 36 2 million for the 2017 respective periods excluding purechem restructuring costs and one time cfo transition costs q4 2018 adjusted ebitdac was 42 1 million beating adjusted ebitdac of 41 8 million in q4 2017 adjusted ebitdac for the year ended december 31 2018 was 167 6 million as compared to 154 0 million for the year ended december 31 2017 representing an increase of 13 6 million or 9 year over year the company s operating results continued to benefit from increased activity levels due to the improved commodity price environment and ces business in both us and canada have made positive contributions to revenue net income and ebitdac ces continues to maintain a prudent balance sheet and is well positioned to capitalize on the improving oilfield activity levels in the us and weather the current decline in industry activity in canada in october 2017 ces successfully re financed and reduced its coupon on its 300 0 million senior notes by issuing new 6 375 senior notes which have an extended maturity into october 2024 at december 31 2018 ces had a net draw of 161 5 million on its senior facility december 31 2017 109 3 million an increase of 12 1 million from 149 4 million as at september 30 2018 which is primarily driven by working capital build capital expansion incurred in the quarter which includes the completion of purechem s grande prairie facility and the buildout of the kermit mud plant in the permian basin and opportunistic share repurchases through ces ncib program the maximum available draw on the senior facility at december 31 2018 was 180 0 million on the canadian facility and us 40 0 million on the us facility december 31 2017 125 0 million and us 40 0 million respectively at december 31 2018 ces in compliance with the terms and covenants of its senior facility as at the date hereof the company had a net draw of approximately 150 0 million on its senior facility ces continues to see improvement in its financial position and the company s board of directors and management believe that the market price of ces common shares do not reflect their underlying value on july 17 2018 the company began a normal course issuer bid ncib to repurchase for cancellation up to 24 587 978 common shares the ncib will terminate on july 16 2019 or such earlier date as the maximum number of common shares are purchased pursuant to the ncib or the ncib is completed or is terminated at the company s election in q4 2018 the company repurchased 2 099 900 common shares at an average price of 3 42 per share for a total amount 7 2 million year to date the company repurchased 4 799 900 common shares at a weighted average price per share of 4 07 per share for a total amount of 19 5 million representing 19 5 of total shares available to repurchase under the ncib outlook ces continues to be optimistic about its prospects for 2019 and beyond ces record consolidated revenue result and record us revenue result in 2018 reflect its effective execution in a dynamic environment and ces strategy has positioned the company to take advantage of the opportunities ahead ces believes that over time it can continue to grow its share of the oilfield consumable chemical markets in which it competes ces also sees the consumable chemical market increasing its share of the oilfield spend as operators continue to drill longer reach laterals and drill them faster expand and optimize the utilization of pad drilling and cube development techniques increase the intensity and size of their fracs and require increasingly technical and specialized chemical treatments to effectively maintain existing cash flow generating wells and treat growing production from new wells in the us ces infrastructure is largely built out to meet anticipated growing production chemical and drilling fluid needs in the key basins in the permian basin the kermit texas mud plant expansion has been designed to double capacity over 2017 levels and has enabled the company to take on new work and continue to grow market share in addition catalyst s current platform is setup to capitalize on growing production and higher levels of activity in the permian basin which ces believes will be even more pronounced in 2019 as several pipeline projects are on track to add significant offtake capacity further ces continues to recruit top talent in this highly competitive region ces plans to expand its existing barite grinding capabilities in the us further adding to the company s competitive positioning and operating leverage in canada market conditions faced headwinds due to current takeaway capacity constraints and lack of consistent market access causing commodity price differentials to widen significantly and curtailment of production levels resulting in canadian oil and gas operators paring back capital programs in q1 2019 as winter drilling activity is trending down 30 over q1 2018 price differentials were positively impacted in q4 2018 by the mandatory crude oil production curtailments established by the alberta government and ces believes that its current business is well positioned to capitalize on an improved canadian outlook in h2 2019 and increased financial contribution from its purechem division as the company grows into this infrastructure and continues to add scale ces strategy is to utilize its decentralized management model its vertically integrated manufacturing model its problem solving through science approach its patented and proprietary technologies and its superior people and execution to increase market share the downturn made many middlemen or competitors who are simply resellers of other company s products redundant by being basic in the manufacture of the consumable chemicals it sells ces continues to be price competitive and a technology leader recent competitor consolidations and business failures will provide further opportunities for ces as operators require increasingly technical solutions and deeper customer centric coverage models to meet their needs ces believes that its unique value proposition makes it the premier independent provider of technically advanced consumable chemical solutions to the north american oilfield ces balance sheet is well positioned to capitalize on robust oilfield activity levels in the us and weather the current decline in industry activity in canada in october 2017 ces successfully re financed and reduced its coupon on its 300 0 million senior notes by issuing new 6 375 senior notes which have an extended maturity into october 2024 in 2019 it is expected that ebitdac will materially exceed the sum of cash expenditures on interest taxes and capital expenditures allowing for free cash flow to be returned to shareholders through ces monthly dividend and recently implemented ncib as ces infrastructure buildout in both canada and the us was largely completed in 2018 absent acceptable return expansionary capital projects such as the buildout of the northeast us barite facility ces expects capital expenditures in 2019 to return to levels below 2017 2018 levels ces business model capital structure and free cash flow generation attributes continue to permit prudent capital allocation to one or a combination of investment in current operations debt reduction opportunistic share repurchases dividends and acquisitions ces will continue to assess organic and m a opportunities that will improve ces competitive position and enhance profitability any acquisitions must meet ces stringent financial and operational metrics in its

general development describe the areas of energy development in the country as an organisation for economic co operation and development member country turkey had one of the highest growing rates of energy demand over the past 15 years currently turkey is only able to meet around 26 per cent of its total energy demand through domestic resources the growing demand for energy has resulted in dependency on energy imports especially in terms of oil and natural gas according to the 2018 investor s guide published by the ministry of energy and natural resources menr turkey imported 28 7bcm of natural gas from russia 9 3bcm of natural gas from iran and 6 5bcm of natural gas from azerbaijan in 2017 major oil and natural gas transmission projects include the iraq turkey crude oil pipeline the baku tbilisi ceyhan crude oil petroleum pipeline the trans anatolia natural gas pipeline project and the turkstream natural gas pipeline in the electricity sector according to the investor s guide turkey is the sixth largest european electricity market with a 5 5 per cent growth in annual demand since 2002 turkey s installed capacity has exceeded 87gw with the help of investments made by the private sector electricity generation is dominated by the private sector leaving build operate and build operate transfer model based power plants with a shrinking share with its top priority being to decrease import dependency turkey approaches its energy policies with the aim of incentivising the growth of renewable energy generation facilities turkey has a growing interest in nuclear energy a russian joint venture company commenced construction of the first nuclear power plant located in akkuyu in april 2018 and a french japanese consortium is to build the second nuclear plant in sinop the government continues to encourage use of local lignite reserves as a valuable alternative to natural gas for electricity generation renewable energy resources are becoming more and more attractive in the turkish energy market solar energy is the primary renewable resource with an installed capacity of 4 726mw at the end of june 2018 role of government describe the government s role in the ownership and development of energy resources outline the current energy policy pursuant to the constitution of the republic of turkey the government is the owner of all natural wealth and resources and has the right to explore and operate such resources however the government may transfer this right to individuals or legal entities for a certain period of time turkey s escalating demand for energy combined with its dependency on foreign oil and natural gas forces the government to develop policies and intensify its efforts to ensure supply security with the aim of reducing foreign dependency the government encourages the use of domestic energy and mineral resources supports the production of energy from renewable resources and provides incentives to investors in that regard the government s policy is to increase the share of renewable resources and include nuclear energy as a more sustainable resource turkey obtains 99 per cent of its natural gas needs from foreign countries but aims to decrease the share of imported natural gas through promoting local resources with government incentives and with a focus on research exploration and exploitation of natural gas although turkey s coal resource is not abundant using coal to generate electricity is a valuable alternative to natural gas dependency all in all the menr continues its efforts to make use of all of its local lignite and hard coal reserves for energy production by 2023 and plans to support the private sector in this respect commercial civil law substantive rules and industry standards describe any industry standard form contracts used in the energy sector in your jurisdiction industry standard form contracts are used in certain areas of the energy sector in turkey the content and form of such contracts varies depending on the nature of the energy sector the framework of the notable ones can be summarised as follows the turkish electricity transmission corporation uses standard connection and system usage agreements approved by the energy market regulatory authority emra when executing contracts with distribution companies organised industrial zones and consumers who wish to connect and use the transmission system market actors wishing to participate in the turkish energy exchange should sign a market participation agreement and enter into intra day and day ahead market participation agreements with the energy markets operation corporation epi̇aş to register to the organised mass natural gas sale market a standard form accession agreement should be executed between the investor and epi̇aş to participate in the wholesale natural gas market investors should sign two standard accession agreements one with epi̇aş and one with takasbank in addition shippers turkish petroleum pipeline corporation botaş and epi̇aş should also execute the protocol for reconciliation of imbalances carriers of natural gas resources should also sign a standard form carriage agreement with botaş finally the end users or distribution companies must sign an outlet connection agreement pursuant to the natural gas distribution regulations exploration and exploitation of petroleum and natural gas operation rights and transfer of these natural resources are generally made through licensing permitting privatisation agreements and private agreements pursuant to the principle of freedom of contract to be applied in conformity with related laws and regulations what rules govern contractual interpretation in non consumer contracts in general do these rules apply to energy contracts the turkish code of obligations no 6098 tco is the main piece of legislation detailing the principles of contract law the general principles in the tco apply to all contracts including those signed in the energy sector unless the contract is classified as an administrative law contract pursuant to article 19 of the tco a contract must be interpreted according to the true and mutual intention of the parties if it is not possible to determine the true mutual intention of the parties in respect to the disputed provision then the assumed intent of the parties has to be established by the courts if the parties mutual intention cannot be determined contracts are usually interpreted in opposition to the party preparing the contract this rule generally applies to the standard form one sided general terms and conditions describe any commonly recognised industry standards for establishing liability article 18 2 of the turkish commercial code no 6102 defines the prudent businessperson standard requiring each merchant to act as a prudent businessperson in all his or her commercial activities this standard is based on the due care of an average prudent responsible and organised businessperson and is evaluated objectively in terms of directors however the turkish commercial code echoes the well known business judgement rule overall prudent businessperson standard is also mirrored in sector specific legislation accordingly the natural gas market certificate regulation and the natural gas market licence regulation holds certificate and licence holders to the standard of a reasonable and prudent businessperson the electricity market licence regulation underlines that a company is obliged to make electricity or capacity purchases as a prudent merchant in consumer sales transactions as frequently seen in practice the bona fide principle requires rights owners to act in a reasonable honest and trustworthy manner when utilising their rights the concepts of intent wilful misconduct and gross negligence are also important in terms of liability analysis as for the contractual limitation of liabilities see question 8 performance mitigation are concepts of force majeure commercial impracticability or frustration or other concepts that would excuse performance during periods of commodity price or supply volatility recognised in your jurisdiction yes as per the principle of rebus sic stantibus a judge is entitled to adjust the provisions of a contract in line with the concepts of equity and fairness upon the request of the injured party to the contract however adjustment of contract provisions by the court is a direct interference with the parties freedom of contract and the pacta sunt servanda principle therefore for judges to implement the principle of rebus sic stantibus either the conditions of the contract must be extremely affected such that fulfilment of the contract obligations under the affected conditions would create an imbalance between the parties or the basis for the transaction must be partially or totally disrupted a change in circumstances will invoke adjustment of a contract if i the parties do not perform their obligations ii new circumstances affecting the contract arise iii such new circumstances do not arise from the acts of either party iv it was not possible for the parties at the execution of the contract to foresee the change in circumstances and v the new circumstances make it impossible for one party to comply with its contractual obligations the above mentioned general principles of the tco and the turkish administrative laws are also applicable to contracts in the energy sector in addition energy market legislation electricity gas and petroleum regulates specific force majeure events that may lead to the suspension or postponement of a licence holder s market related obligations nuisance what are the rules on claims of nuisance to obstruct energy development may operators be subject to nuisance and negligence claims from third parties under turkish law any person who is directly or indirectly affected by the actions of a third party or a decision of an administrative body may initiate a lawsuit before the relevant court initiation of a lawsuit per se will not suspend an energy project however the court may render a decision for injunctive relief resulting in suspension of the relevant project in terms of nuisance operators may be subject to private nuisance claims stemming from smoke noise vibrations or other various factors that the operator may have caused pursuant to article 730 of the turkish civil code no 4721 this article depicts the liability of a real property owner to its neighbouring landowners in terms of public nuisance claims judicial review of claims to cancel administrative licences is open to applicants with the appropriate locus standi for negligence claims the court may decide indemnification of the affected party pursuant to the general provisions of the tco liability and limitations how may parties limit remedies by agreement under turkish law the principle of freedom of contract prevails therefore contractual clauses limiting the liability of parties are valid and enforceable except for liability arising from severe fault including wilful misconduct and gross negligence in addition the tco introduces two other exceptions to the general principle of limitation of liability arising from slight fault accordingly contract provisions limiting liability for slight fault are invalid provided that such liability arises from either an employment agreement or a provision of services requiring contractor s expertise and conducted within the scope of a permit issued by a governmental authority such as engineers or architects who must obtain a licence from the relevant occupational chamber furthermore while turkish law does not have an exact equivalent concept to liquidated damages the tco does contain similar contractual concepts under the general principle of freedom of contract and articles 158 161 of the tco contractual penalties including penalty interest are enforceable under turkish law furthermore the contracting parties may freely determine the penalty to be imposed for failure to perform the obligations arising from such contract accordingly if the parties to a contract have agreed on a penalty clause the sum fixed is the limit on damages for breach regardless of whether or not it exceeds or falls short of the actual damage unless the creditor proves that its actual damages are more than the penalty amount is strict liability applicable for damage resulting from any activities in the energy sector turkish law introduces the concept of objective liability which is similar to the principles of strict liability in foreign jurisdictions where fault is not required for a party to be held liable under turkish law objective liability is limited to specific instances explicitly codified under the relevant legislation the instances relevant to the energy sector are liability arising from environmental pollution employer liability and liability of property owners stemming from defective construction as per the environmental law no 2872 environmental law polluters of the environment and those who cause damage to the environment are responsible regardless of their degree of fault for any damage arising from the pollution and destruction it may cause the polluter will also be required to pay compensation for the resulting damage according to the general provisions for the objective liability of employers an employer can avoid liability by demonstrating that due care in employment decisions inspection of work selection of tools and organisation of work was shown under an objective standard a construction owner s objective liability cannot be diminished but the construction owner may seek recourse from the person who caused the damage in addition article 5 of the law of construction and operation of nuclear power plants and the sale of energy no 5710 refers to the 1960 paris convention on third party liability in the field of nuclear energy for the establishment of the objective liability of the nuclear power plant operator commercial civil law procedural enforcement how do courts in your jurisdiction resolve competing clauses in multiple contracts relating to a single transaction lease licence or concession with respect to choice of forum choice of law or mode of dispute resolution turkish law does not provide for a straightforward solution on how to address competing clauses in multiple contracts relating to a single transaction however turkish law recognises choice in dispute resolution mechanisms set forth in the relevant agreement and contractual freedom of the contracting parties therefore issues are addressed on a case by case basis to take into account the specifics of the relevant contract bundle by applying the methods of contractual interpretation within the auspices of the tco are stepped and split dispute clauses common are they enforceable under the law of your jurisdiction under the applicable legislation there is no explicit provision prohibiting stepped and split dispute resolution clauses however there is no established or unified understanding on this matter particularly when arbitration is involved as dispute resolution mechanism the international arbitration law no 4686 defines the most important element of an arbitration agreement as the will of the parties turkish courts have held arbitration agreements invalid in cases where the will of the parties is not clear for instance in its decisions dated 2013 and 2015 the court of appeals decided that an arbitration clause stipulating that a dispute should be heard in court provided that the subject matter of the dispute is not resolved in an arbitral tribunal is invalid due to the fact that parties choice to arbitrate is not explicitly stated in light of the above it may be expected that the turkish courts may not be very welcoming for stepped and split clauses and may tend to render arbitration agreements invalid on the grounds that the intention of the parties is not clear accordingly when setting up a multi tiered dispute resolution mechanism the parties should specify under which conditions the dispute should be resolved and by what dispute resolution method any approach to the contrary may undermine the validity of the arbitration agreement how is expert evidence used in your courts what are the rules on engagement and use of experts as per the turkish code on civil procedure no 6100 procedure code judges may appoint experts to issue their opinions when evaluation of the facts relating to the case requires technical expertise that the judge does not possess experts may be appointed by the judge upon request of the parties or ex officio at the sole discretion of the judge experts appointed by the court should meet the independence criteria set forth under relevant legislation if there is an allegation of partiality the expert appointed may be dismissed by the court in practice most expert opinions include evaluations asserting legal opinions that go beyond the scope of technical analysis that being the case the court of appeals has a tendency to reverse rulings rendered without an expert opinion at the first instance courts which leads to encouraging the frequent use of expert opinions as per the procedure code apart from expert opinions issued by court appointed experts the parties may obtain opinions from experts they deem appropriate and use these opinions as reference points in their petitions that being said the credibility of an opinion obtained from an external expert as opposed to court appointed expert is not as eminent as the former what interim and emergency relief may a court in your jurisdiction grant for energy disputes under turkish law there is no particular interim or emergency relief provisions specific to energy disputes therefore the general rules governing such measures are applicable to energy disputes there are a variety of temporary legal protections available including preliminary injunction preliminary attachment record of evidence and decision to stay proceedings in an administrative jurisdiction if the administrative act or judicial decision is clearly contrary to law the relevant administrative act or judicial decision may be suspended to prevent irreparable damages another frequently used tool is a stay of proceedings decision that postpones the implementation of an administrative act or judicial decision until the judicial proceedings have been finalised upon the request of the plaintiff an administrative court may grant a stay of proceedings decision what is the enforcement process for foreign judgments and foreign arbitral awards in energy disputes in your jurisdiction turkish courts recognise and enforce foreign arbitration awards and foreign judgments subject to the satisfaction of the various conditions explained below turkey is a party to two principal international treaties applicable to the enforcement procedures of foreign arbitral awards namely the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards new york convention and the convention on the settlement of investment disputes between states and nationals of other states icsid convention or washington convention turkey acceded to and ratified the new york convention with two reservations turkey will comply with the new york convention i in accordance with the reciprocity principle and only for the recognition and enforcement of arbitration awards rendered in a contracting party s country and ii only for disputes that are deemed commercial disputes under turkish law arising from either contractual or non contractual relationships accordingly recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitration awards issued in countries party to the new york convention are conducted in accordance with the conditions prescribed under the new york convention according to article 54 of the icsid convention an award rendered pursuant to this convention will be recognised as binding by the courts of the contracting states and the courts should accordingly enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by the award as if it were a final judgment of a court in that state turkey is one of the contracting states of the icsid the turkish international private and procedural law no 5718 ippl regulates foreign judgments and foreign arbitral awards as per the ippl once the subject matter foreign judgment is finalised in a foreign jurisdiction the enforcement procedure may be initiated before turkish civil courts by anyone who has a legitimate interest in its enforcement the ippl sets out conditions that must be satisfied for foreign arbitral awards and foreign judgments to be enforced accordingly turkish courts will accept the enforcement of foreign arbitral awards unless one of the following circumstances exists the parties have not concluded an arbitration agreement or included an arbitration clause in the agreement the arbitral award is in violation of morality or public policy the dispute in question cannot be resolved by arbitration under turkish laws either party was not represented in the arbitration and did not explicitly accept the relevant actions afterwards the party against whom the arbitral award is to be enforced was not notified of the selection of the arbitrators or was denied the right to defend the arbitration agreement or the arbitration clause is invalid according to either the law it is subject to or if there is no such agreement the law of the country where the arbitral award was rendered the selection of the arbitrators or the procedure followed by the arbitrators is in violation of the parties agreement or if there is no such agreement the law of the country where the arbitral award was rendered the arbitral award is related to a matter that is not included in the arbitration agreement or is exceeding the scope of the arbitration agreement or of the arbitration clause rejection will only apply to the excluded or exceeding part and the arbitral award is not finalised not enforceable or not binding upon the parties according to either the law that it is subject to or the law of the country where the arbitral award is rendered or the procedure to which it is subject to or was revoked by the relevant authority of the country where the arbitral award is rendered the conditions for the enforcement of foreign judgements are listed separately under the ippl for enforcement of a foreign judgment the following conditions must be met i there must be a contractual or effective reciprocity between the turkish courts and the jurisdiction in which the judgment is rendered ii the judgment must not be related to an issue falling within the exclusive jurisdiction of the turkish courts and must relate to a private law dispute iii the judgment must not clearly violate turkish public order and iv due process must have been observed under the laws of the relevant foreign jurisdiction alternative dispute resolution are there any arbitration institutions that specifically administer energy disputes in your jurisdiction there is no arbitration institution that specifically administers energy disputes in turkey however the istanbul arbitration centre established in 2014 is an independent institution offering arbitration and mediation services for the resolution of disputes energy related disputes can be filed at the istanbul arbitration centre additionally turkey became party to the energy charter treaty in 1994 pursuant to article 26 of the treaty disputes between a contracting party and an investor of another contracting party as defined in the energy charter treaty may choose to submit the dispute to the icsid the arbitration institute of the stockholm chamber of commerce or to a sole arbitrator or ad hoc arbitration tribunal appointed as per the arbitration rules of the united nations commission on international trade law is there any general preference for litigation over arbitration or vice versa in the energy sector in your jurisdiction given the scale of energy investments projects usually require significant financial support for this reason foreign financial institutions are heavily involved in the turkish energy sector thus parties often prefer to choose arbitration over litigation as the chosen dispute resolution method over the past decade mediation has also become a trending dispute resolution method in turkey in 2017 the mediation centre for energy disputes a sectoral based institution was established to enhance the use of mediation in energy disputes the mediation centre organised under the energy law research institute aims to resolve private law energy disputes as per the rules of mediation published by the energy law research institute as the mediation centre is fairly new to the energy sector the process remains to be tested in practice are statements made in settlement discussions including mediation confidential discoverable or without prejudice settlement discussions whether in the form of conciliation or mediation are confidential in terms of conciliation for civil disputes the confidentiality requirement stems from the attorneys code no 1136 as such unless decided otherwise lawyers are required to keep any records or related documents that they acquire during conciliation discussions confidential and breach of such obligation leads to administrative sanctions as per the applicable legislation on mediation the mediator should keep any documents or statements submitted during the mediation process confidential unless parties of the mediation mutually waive such requirement failure to comply with such requirement may lead to imprisonment of up to six months privacy and privilege are there any data protection trade secret or other privacy issues for the purposes of e disclosure e discovery in a proceeding turkish law does not recognise the e disclosure or e discovery procedure within the meaning of the anglo american tradition in terms of the current procedural law the disclosure obligation refers to the presentation of evidence in which the parties constructed their arguments upon to the court the court may require further evidence from the counter party or any other third party in this case data protection issues may come up during proceedings the law on the protection of personal data no 6698 enacted in 2016 provides the core framework of the data protection law and has major similarities with the eu s data protection directive 95 46 ec accordingly in respect to the processing or transfer of personal data save for a few exceptions the explicit consent of the data subject is required data controllers who are defined under the data protection law as real persons or legal entities that set the objectives and means to process personal data and are in charge of the establishment and management of a data filing system must provide the data inventory necessary for the identification and record keeping of data processing procedures in addition to administrative sanctions available under the data protection law the turkish criminal code no 5237 criminal code provides the penal framework for any breach of the subject matter what are the rules in your jurisdiction regarding attorney client privilege and work product privileges pursuant to article 36 of the attorneys code attorneys are under the obligation not to disclose any information related to their clients or potential clients prior to during or after representation of the client without the express permission of the client attorneys have the right to avoid testifying in relation to information acquired during the representation of their clients jurisdiction must some energy disputes as a matter of jurisdiction first be heard before an administrative agency administrative agency review is not a precondition for judicial review in energy disputes administrative procedural law no 2577 provides a discretionary administrative review option accordingly articles 10 and 11 of the administrative procedural law allow individuals to apply to the administrative agency that has adopted the act or actions or to the administrative agency with a higher ranking and request amendment or cancellation of the administration s acts or actions that said according to article 13 of administrative procedural law application to the agency that has adopted administrative action is only mandatory provided that the individual wishes to be compensated for damages incurred as a result of such action therefore individuals wishing to file a compensation lawsuit against an administrative agency whose actions have caused a certain amount of damage should initially apply to the administrative body itself and request compensation a lawsuit may only be filed after the administrative agency refuses to pay the compensation without judicial review for the avoidance of doubt above prerequisite is not applicable for administrative acts but solely for administrative actions emra also has sector specific administrative review duties emra can mediate disputes that arise during the course of negotiations between licence holders when the parties cannot come to an agreement on the terms of the system connection and system usage agreements emra is also empowered to carry out mediation in disputes arising from existing agreements and if required to propose amendments to these agreements regulatory relevant agencies identify the principal agencies that regulate the energy sector and briefly describe their general jurisdiction below is a list of the principal agencies that regulate the energy sector in turkey the menr is the main administrative authority that determines energy policy objectives plans and programmes with the related institutions emra is the key body that regulates the electricity oil and gas markets emra can issue directives in order to promote consumer rights ensure quality of service and set pricing principles moreover emra is responsible for issuing and revoking licences the general directorate of petroleum affairs supervises applications and issues licenses in relation to upstream oil and gas activities the general directorate of mineral research and exploration is an institution supervised by menr to conduct geographical surveys in turkey to explore natural resources access to infrastructure do new entrants to the market have rights to access infrastructure if so may the regulator intervene to facilitate access although turkish law encourages private legal entities to enter the energy market it also guarantees equal treatment for new entrants to ensure the efficient and safe operation of energy resources as per the electricity market law no 6446 operators of distribution and transmission networks are required to provide distribution and transmission services to all distribution and transmission system users equally without discrimination furthermore according to the natural gas market law no 4646 companies in the natural gas market are required to provide other companies active in the same market with accurate and adequate information in the natural gas market companies holding transmission licences are obliged not to discriminate between third parties of equal status such companies may reject third party access requests only on the grounds exhaustively listed under the natural gas market law the petroleum market law no 5015 also obliges companies to meet market demands equally and without discrimination so long as the demands do not infringe on the transmission and storage capacity restrictions judicial review what is the mechanism for judicial review of decisions relating to the sector taken by administrative agencies and other public bodies are non judicial procedures to challenge the decisions of the energy regulator available judicial review of decisions made by administrative agencies is mainly regulated under the administrative procedural law individuals may file annulment procedures and compensation procedures against the administrative acts or actions as stated under question 20 the administrative procedural law provides a discretionary administrative review option for individuals seeking remediation against the acts and actions of administrative agencies by nature of the energy sector judicial review of concession agreements is also of importance in the previous years there has been question as to whether or not the individuals affected by these administrative law agreements can file for judicial review of the provisions of these agreements the council of state in its many rulings has stated that individuals whose rights are affected by the concession agreements can file cancellation actions against the concession agreements in this regard the council of state classifies administrative law agreements as if they were regulatory legislation and conducts judicial review of the agreements additionally the ombudsman law no 6328 allows an ombudsman to review the acts and actions of an administrative body upon the complaint and is entitled for the unbinding review of administrative actions therefore its decisions are advisory in nature that being said administrative bodies tend to comply with the advice of the ombudsman fracking what is the legal and regulatory position on hydraulic fracturing in your jurisdiction there is no special regime on unconventional upstream activities such as the exploration and production of shale gas shale oil gas hydrates and coal bed methane they are governed under the general framework of turkish petroleum law no 6491 and its secondary regulations the hydraulic fracturing method mostly used for shale gas exploration activities falls within the scope of unconventional upstream activities and is subject to a strict set of environmental compliance and filing requirements in respect to environmental law obligations informing the local population of such activity is also required other regulatory issues describe any statutory or regulatory protection for indigenous groups there is currently no statutory or regulatory protection provided specifically for indigenous groups nevertheless judicial review procedures for the annulment and cancellation of administrative acts are open to all applicants having locus standi under the administrative procedural law describe any legal or regulatory barriers to entry for foreign companies looking to participate in energy development in your jurisdiction energy sector regulations are very investor friendly however by extension of the limitations set forth in other fields of law in practice local investors sometimes gain advantages over energy investments for instance the licensing process requires potential investors to prove its sufficiency to the relevant administrative body while assessing the sufficiency of the investor the administration also takes into consideration whether or not the investor has enough assets or connections within the country for instance when assessing the licensing applications for solar energy and wind energy generation when the owner of the land on which generation activity will be conducted is also among the applicants emra should grant the licence to the landowner given that the acquisition of immovable property in turkey is slightly more cumbersome for foreign investors local investors gain an advantage ipso facto that being said many mechanisms are available to accommodate foreign investors round such obstacles what criminal health and safety and environmental liability do companies in the energy sector most commonly face and what are the associated penalties pursuant to the environmental law expenses incurred to prevent limit and eliminate pollution and degradation should be covered by the polluter or by the person who caused the degradation and certain administrative fines are imposed by the related the administrative authority according to the general principles of the tco a person who caused damage is obliged to eliminate this damage as explained under question 9 there are also some strict liability provisions set forth under the relevant legislation we refer to our explanations under question 9 for the strict liability and the penalties associated with the same under the environmental law as for the criminal aspect pursuant to article 181 and the following articles of the criminal code a person who intentionally or negligently causes pollution of soil water or air or causes noise pollution zoning pollution or intoxicates the environment is either imprisoned punished with a monetary penalty or both the occupational health and safety law no 6331 also sets forth certain responsibilities for employers to ensure the occupational health and safety of employees by carrying out all kinds of measures failure to comply with this requirement may result in administrative fines compensation of damages or the shutting down of the facility other sovereign boundary disputes describe any actual or anticipated sovereign boundary disputes involving your jurisdiction that could affect the energy sector we are not aware of any actual or anticipated sovereign boundary dispute that could affect the energy sector energy treaties is your jurisdiction party to the energy charter treaty or any other energy treaty turkey was among the participants of the energy charter conference and executed the energy charter treaty in 1994 after less than a decade in 2001 turkey finally ratified the trade related provisions of the energy charter treaty further the international energy charter signed in 2015 intends to strengthen energy cooperation between the signatory states investment protection describe any available measures for protecting investors in the energy industry in your jurisdiction protection of investors has been an important matter in turkey for over 30 years turkey as an emerging economy has adopted various national and international regulations to ensure the level of security required by foreign investors unless otherwise required under international treaties or specific provisions of law as explained below foreign investors are subject to the same treatment and entitled to the same investment incentives as local turkish investors under the foreign direct investments code no 4875 fdi code the scope of incentives granted with respect to a particular investment is determined according to the purpose volume and location of such investment additionally the investment support and promotion agency ispa was established in 2006 under the office of the prime minister of the republic of turkey to attract foreign investment the ispa develops and implements investment support and promotion strategies and assists foreign investors with the procedures for working with governmental institutions as per the fdi code foreign investors like local investors are free to repatriate net profits dividends proceeds from the sale or liquidation of their investment royalties or fees arising from licensing management and similar agreements or principal and interest payments under external loans through banks or other authorised financial institutions there are only a limited number of exceptions to the principle of equal treatment of foreign and domestic investors including restrictions on foreign control or ownership in a limited number of regulated sectors such as defence and broadcasting and certain approval or notification requirements in others eg energy banking insurance as well as the acquisition of real property a very valuable instrument for the protection of investors is multilateral treaties especially in terms of alternative dispute resolution as explained under question 14 turkey is a party to the new york convention and the icsid convention to promote its arbitration friendly environment to attract investment furthermore turkey has signed over 80 bilateral investment treaties with various countries these bilateral investment treaties similar to the energy charter treaty mostly include investor friendly provisions such as most favoured nation provisions fair and equitable treatment provisions and monetary transfer provisions turkey has also been party to the multilateral investment guarantee agency which has been providing political risk insurance to the investors since 1985 cybersecurity describe any legal standards or best practices regarding cybersecurity relevant to the energy industry in your jurisdiction including those related to the applicable standard of care in 2012 pursuant to decree no 2012 3842 regarding the implementation management and coordination of national cyber security a cybersecurity group has been established under the ministry of transportation maritime affairs and communications in 2014 the regulation on protection of network and data in the electronic communications sector was issued which describes the measures to be taken by companies depending on their field of activity to provide cybersecurity during electronic communications the measures mainly include the establishment of an information security management system and an information security working group the adoption of an information security policy the evaluation of the possible risks on a yearly basis reporting of any incident infringing the information security training of personnel management of the electronic systems etc also as per the regulation on information security in industrial control systems energy companies should report to emra the inventory of the industrial control systems used accordingly each company together with emra should set out the required actions for elimination of the risks reported under the inventory as outlined in turkey the sectoral cybersecurity rules mainly arise from secondary legislation but not from a dedicated law governing cybersecurity however data protection law no 6698 may be considered as a framework legislation on the issue given that it regulates among others cybersecurity in general terms update and trends update and trends list any major developments case law statute or regulation that are anticipated to affect the energy sector in your jurisdiction in the next 12 months including any developments related to the taxation of energy projects what is the anticipated impact of climate change regulations treaties and public opinion on energy disputes the menr focuses on encouraging the use of local energy and mineral resources support in the generation of energy out of renewable resources and further aims to reduce production costs renewable energy resource area rera projects will increase the portion of local and renewable resources in the generation of electricity the government also provides production sites for electricity generation facilities and extra incentives for the use of local equipment in the generation processes in addition to rera with the renewable energy resources supporting mechanism rersm the number of power plants utilising renewable energy sources continues to increase pursuant to the latest statements from the energy and natural resources minister the rersm will not continue under the same conditions but the government may support new energy power plants built after 2020 by rera to reach the government s target on renewable energy resources as per the council of ministers decision regarding state aid on investments dated 3 may 2017 nuclear power plants are considered a priority investment to benefit from specific tax exemptions or tax reductions and other incentives as explained in question 1 turkey has a developing interest in nuclear energy and has taken action for the construction of its first two nuclear power plants it is expected that a third nuclear power plant will be built in the thrace region in the upcoming years turkey s national research ships barbaros hayrettin and paşa oruç reis are exploring the high seas for national petroleum and natural gas resources in the mediterranean and black sea and the deep sea drill ship fatih has begun drilling natural gas in the alanya district all in all the business environment in turkey has resisted the domestic and international political and economic challenges of the past year and it is expected to demonstrate similar resilience throughout 2019 turkey s sizeable energy demand has played a significant role in the business environment in terms of m a deals completed in 2018 the largest portion of deal values belongs to the energy sector the energy sector is also expected to draw greater attention from domestic and foreign investors going forward the turkstream pipeline project which aims to transport natural gas resources from russia to turkey and eastern europe has been under construction for over three years the majority of the pipeline s construction has been completed and it is expected to commence operations within the first quarter of 2019 the contemplated length of the pipeline is 930km spanning across the black sea to turkey s thrace region

oil and petroleum products carolyn kissane academic director and clinical professor at the center for global affairs at new york university leads the conversation on the geopolitics of oil faskianos thank you welcome to the final session of the winter spring 2023 cfr academic webinar series i m irina faskianos vice president of the national program and outreach here at cfr today s discussion is on the record and the video and transcript will be available on our website cfr org academic if you would like to share these materials with your colleagues or classmates as always cfr takes no institutional positions on matters of policy we are delighted to have carolyn kissane with us to discuss the geopolitics of oil dr kissane is the academic director of both the graduate program in global affairs and the graduate program in global security conflict and cybercrime at nyu s center for global affairs where she is also a clinical professor she also serves as director of the energy climate justice and sustainability lab in the school of professional studies at nyu she was named in 2013 by breaking energy as one of the top ten new york women in energy and top ten energy communicator she s a member of the council on foreign relations and the national committee on u s china relations and serves on several boards so carolyn thanks very much for doing this we really appreciate it i thought we could begin by talking about how has the geopolitics of oil changed especially vis à vis russia s war in ukraine and opec s recent announcement to cut oil production kissane well first of all i d just like to say thank you so very much for having me i m really delighted i am a big fan of cfr s academic webinars so to have the opportunity to participate in this in this way is very meaningful to me so thank you so wow there is so much happening in this space the geopolitics of oil this has been a tremendous fourteen months russia s reinvasion of ukraine very much upended the geopolitics of oil because russia is a significant producer one of the top three in the world and it s you know it s caused a kind of a reshaping a kind of a remapping of the of oil geopolitics and we ve seen some you know shifts in how countries think about oil security in light of larger questions about broader energy security questions and also on top of that is the ongoing energy transition coupled with you know climate change and the need to decarbonize so there s just it s been quite a you know a year and a half that has really sort of put energy security and oil security very much at the forefront of people s minds faskianos fantastic i thought maybe you had some really interesting data to show us and if you could walk us through those the trends you are seeing and really bring it to life that would be fantastic kissane sure so before i do i have a couple of slides and before i share my slides i think it s really important that sort of we understand how interconnected sort of the global energy system is and how interconnected we are when it comes to the flows of oil you know some countries are very well resourced endowed so they have oil and other countries do not so they need to import oil there s really no country in the world that doesn t need oil for larger national security issues and i think one of things that many people sort of are not necessarily aware of or think about is the amount of oil that gets produced every day so every day the world consumes over 100 million barrels a day and every day that 100 million barrels has to be has to be moved it has to be you know as part of getting it into the system getting it to its respective destinations and what we re not seeing which maybe some people may have thought that we would see at this point is we re not seeing a reduction in demand but we re seeing an expansion in demand and much of that global demand is coming out of asia and we re also of course seeing the with the reopening of china lots of really interesting questions as to what oil demand will be in china for the 2023 2024 years whether or not they will they will sort of put extra pressure on global demand and you know irina just also you know it s i m going to share this in my slides but you know last week s decision from opec to reduce production of course had an impact on the price of oil so when the decision was announced on sunday by monday morning we saw an uptick in the price it s stabilized but we are sort of looking at 80 plus a barrel oil and again lots of uncertainty as to what that s going to mean across economies that are in recessions experiencing sort of the beginnings of a recession and sort of what does it mean for the global economy where we may see sort of more energy inflation so one of the things that i really like to do when i teach the geopolitics of oil is sort of show some visuals because i think again sort of really reinforcing the interconnected nature of our global energy system but also sort of seeing where in the world is oil produced and where in the world are the are the importers and also just a couple of sort of fun pieces on what we have seen just this you know in the last week of course some of this you ll be familiar with those in the audience but this decision on the part of opec to reduce production by 1 2 million barrels a day again happening at a time not when we have an excess supply but when we re seeing a tight supply across the oil market so it came as a bit of a surprise to you know to even the most you know longstanding analysts and opec observers and again part of this is directed probably toward self interests on the part of saudi arabia and the oil producers that are really going to make the cuts but of course it also has an impact here for those of you that are sitting in the united states what does it mean then for prices that americans pay at the gas pump so the biden administration sort of came out after this decision was made in sort of being disappointed surprised that opec would make this decision now it s also important to sort of recognize that this is not just a singular opec decision this is part of now a larger opec and opec does also include russia as well as other countries like kazakhstan and mexico so the opec that we have historically known is now different because you have other countries that are not official members but nonetheless are part of what we now refer to as opec and these are the countries that are part of opec and really the country that s considered to be sort of in the driver s seat of opec is that of saudi arabia because saudi arabia is the largest producer within the opec organization producing anywhere from 10 to 11 million barrels a day venezuela has the largest reserves but it is far from being at capacity in terms of what it can what it can produce so just to kind of put that into perspective these are opec countries and their respective reserves and then non opec the united states being a non opec country but again this sort of this chart to the right shows you know again the world is consuming a little over 100 million barrels a day expected to increase over 2023 and into 2024 question marks as to when we may see peak oil demand but again to sort of link this to energy security energy security especially when it s in the context of oil security is making sure that we have adequate supply at affordable prices so when we see a reduction in supply at a time of tight markets that suggests that we re also going to see higher prices that s going to directly hit vulnerable economies and so again just to sort of point out sort of where in the world sort of are the top three oil producers the united states saudi arabia and russia russia remains in the top three canada as well our you know neighbor to the north and china is also a producer of oil the united states figure here also includes gas liquefied so liquid petroleum which the united states is endowed with a lot of both oil and natural gas and then the top oil consuming countries you have u s china and india now the united states is not the largest importer that position is now held by china but as far as consumption goes we consume over 20 million barrels a day again big question mark about china in terms of whether or not we will see higher demand coming out of china over the next year two years with china s reopening and what is being you know discussed as revenge tourism and more chinese who have accumulated a lot of savings 2 1 trillion how are they going to use that savings and whether or not after three years of being under lockdown restrictions whether or not we ll see impacts to demand and i think russia is there s lots of questions about russia and this is now we re fourteen months into you know russia s reinvasion of ukraine and i emphasize reinvasion because oftentimes we forget that you know russia invaded ukraine in 2014 but russia is still moving its oil and up until you know a few months ago its overall production and exports were as high at some points even higher than pre invasion now you have new countries that are takers of russian oil and they re buying it at discounted prices we see turkey singapore china has been a big buyer as well as india that they have been buying discounted russian oil lots of interesting questions that we could discuss about the oil price cap and seaborne embargo to europe but i think the takeaway from this slide is that russia continues to produce oil continues to sell it selling at a discounted price but there are still many countries in the world that are eager to take russian oil and again i m not going to go into this but i just love this slide to just emphasize the you know the world s pipelines these are the pipelines that help sort of the transit of oil something also that s really unique and interesting to look at is just tanker traffic so the tankers that carry oil around the world but again you know there are a lot of pipelines so twenty three two thousand three hundred and eighty one operational oil and gas pipelines again these are it s moving a lot of the oil that is consumed every day and then finally is this is you know one of the things that we oftentimes we think about the hundred million barrels a day that the world is consuming over 75 percent of the world s oil is controlled managed by state owned oil companies so saudi aramco being one pdvsa of venezuela being another but it s really important to sort of recognize the position that state owned companies have the rest is controlled or managed by international oil companies exxonmobil chevron eni total and a host of other host of other companies but again i think the you know to understand that nocs as they re referred to are very very important for understanding their role in the larger context of the geopolitics of oil and again what we saw last week coming out of opec this decision this is also being driven by state budget concerns this is again it s about the production of oil but it s also about you know governments and their budgets and oftentimes you know there is a desire to add more rather than you know more revenues rather than less so those are the slides that i have and i hope that they sort of provide some sort of context and a little bit of you know that we can discuss in the questions that i really look forward to answering from the audience faskianos thank you carolyn that was great so now we re going to go to all of you for your questions and comments gives queuing instructions all right so i m going to go to the first raised hand in the thing amadine hom go to you first and please accept the unmute yourself pause you are still muted pause ok i don t know are you there oh i think ok let s go to morton holbrook q yes good afternoon dr kissane what a shocking presentation laughs a hundred million barrels a day and it s going up notwithstanding the paris climate agreement of 2015 is that agreement simply a dead letter or is it having any effect on oil on fossil fuel production particularly oil production or what s the best scenario in terms of reducing dependence on fossil fuels considering the oil market thank you kissane well hi morton thank you so much for that excellent question yeah that s kind of why i emphasize that number is because a lot of people sort of just aren t aware of how much oil we continue to consume and again what the demand expectations are moving forward and these demand expectations are you know coming out of forecasts from the international energy agency so i think there s a big question as to when we see peak demand and you know if you look at bp scenarios they expect peak demand to happen you know before 2030 where as you know others kind of contest that they that they think that peak demand won t happen until after 2030 i mean again a lot depends on you know what we are now experiencing in the energy transition and how sort of quickly are we can we transition away from oil i think what s really critical when we re looking at oil is oftentimes we think only about the transportation sector so we re thinking about cars we re thinking about planes you know we re thinking about trucks and tankers and all these things but it s petrochemicals you know there s just a lot of oil that also goes into fertilizer so it really is across our economy and across economies across the global system one of the things that i always tell my students is even during covid where you had many countries right much of the world was experiencing some level of lockdown we did have a reduction in oil demand but it wasn t it wasn t like 20 million barrels it was under ten so the fact that now it s 2023 the world has reopened it s really hard to sort of see or to know with certainty is when we re going to see that see that reduction in demand now i think with the paris agreement what s also important is to note is you know if you re if you re in the oil and gas space and i was just at a conference earlier this morning where this was a point of conversation was you know what are the companies doing to reduce the emissions from production so how are they integrating carbon capture sequestration you know how are they managing the emissions that come from the production of fossil energy in this case that we re talking about oil and i think one of the things that i think if you sort of follow oil markets or a country like saudi arabia they are marketing low emission oil now we could you know we could sort of challenge well what does that you know what does that really mean but you are having you know countries that are now sort of competing to state that they have lower emitting carbon in the production in the production of oil and that s a whole other interesting sort of thing to look at in the context of the geopolitics of oil is to kind of understand the variation across emissions across different countries in the production of oil so we are you know again we are going to be going into cop 28 this fall again we are not seeing you know and we haven t seen a you know reduction in fossil energy demand again lots of people are sort of you know hoping that we ll start to see it sooner rather than later but for the time being and again you know to irina s first question that you know the last fourteen months and with you know with russia s invasion of ukraine it has both shown us that you know europe is sort of seeking to hasten the energy transition by building out more renewable energy and creating more opportunities to buy electric vehicles but there s still big swaths of the world that you know are still and have yet to move towards you know really reducing and that are actually going to see higher demand moving forward as their economies grow faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from jovana vujanic who is a graduate student at lewis university how big of an of an impact will the decision of the saudi energy minister to cut oil production have on the relationship between the united states and saudi arabia kissane love the question thank you so much yeah no it s a great one so my take is that of course this decision came as a bit of a surprise and it wasn t something that the united states you know wanted but i would say that the u s saudi relationship has been very tense for the last ten years and as part of that there are lots of different reasons for that but this is yet kind of another thing that saudi has done and again i think it s also saudi has taken a non alignment policy with relation to its position on russia and ukraine so it continues to you know it continues to have a relationship with russia it also has the relationship with ukraine as we saw you know china just brokered a very significant deal between saudi arabia and iran you know again saudi arabia and iran are two are two important producers for china so china is a large importer of oil so if you go back to world war the end of world war ii that s when the united states established the oil for security relationship with saudi arabia and as we have grown sort of more i wouldn t say independent but our as our own oil production has increased especially through the shale revolution our dependence on the middle east and saudi arabia more specifically has shifted so i think we re seeing a very different saudi arabia today which i think is going to be a challenge for the united states i think it s going to be very interesting to see what the summer holds last summer the biden administration did tap into the u s strategic petroleum reserves the largest the largest take in the history of the reserves which started in 1975 you know taking 180 million barrels out you know not because there was massive supply disruptions but because you know as the administration said it was you know it was it was it was a war it was a war specific decision because the you know russia s invasion of ukraine was causing energy prices to skyrocket and to cushion the american consumer and to better cushion the sort of the global economy the united states withdrew from the spr so i think the summer is going to be very interesting but i think we re going to see definitely much more attention in the years to come between the united states and saudi arabia it s not the relationship of the past this is a kind of a very new relationship that s a great question faskianos thank you thank you let s go curran flynn who has a raised hand q hello faskianos we can hear you but we re getting feedback so you might have two devices open q can you hear me now faskianos yes q that s better ok faskianos that s better thank you thank you so much q so i m here at king fahd university in saudi arabia right next to aramco here with my class from international relations and one of my students has a question nasser al nasir ph here he is q so thank you mrs carolyn my question is how could russia s use of alternative transportation methods such as the east siberian pipeline to china impact the u s market the domestic market and the role of the spr given potential insurance workarounds from russia s side such as ensuring russian tankers through their rdif fund and thank you to mrs irina kissane thank you and dr flynn thank you so much for having your students join this webinar so i m a little so the question is about the east siberian pipeline just could you would you mind repeating it i just want to make sure i have it i m clear on the question q so how could russia s use of alternative transportation methods such as the east siberian pipeline to china impact the u s energy markets i mean domestically and the spr given potential insurance workarounds from russia s side such as ensuring russian tankers to the rdif fund kissane yeah and that s a great question you know i think that you know begs a lot of things that we could be looking at right in terms of you know russia s kind of ability or capacity to sort of work around or find workarounds to the sanctions that were imposed and i think we ve seen sort of new markets so this kind of reshaping of the energy map with oil we see that as kind of in technicolor right whereas you know a lot of russian oil would go west is now going east you know china india being takers and of course you know other countries as well you know what will be its impact on the on the u s market i think that s you know again i do think the sanctions were sort of carefully put into place so that there wouldn t be massive disruptions so we again you know russia produces over 10 million barrels a day and about 7 million of those barrels are exported so you know if we lost all of that that would be a you know that would cause some very significant economic disruption globally we already saw you know impacts to sort of grains grain exports and food security in many different parts of the world so you know russia is finding different ways you have shadow tankers that russia is using to move to move its oil as you pointed out the east siberian pipeline you know i think there s only so much the united states can do or and european countries that are part of the sanctions regime can do to curtail russian exports of oil but i think that you know i think russia again has a has a desire and also you know revenue needs they re funding a very expensive war that they re finding ways to get their to get their oil out i think an interesting question is you know what does this mean in the years ahead the lack of investment for example that s going into russian energy infrastructure a lack of sort of any kind of western investment that is that is going in and what that is going to mean but again you know i think to your question i think we will see some you know we are seeing some impacts right there s a big question as to what you know what the next six months to a year will look like with regards to the reduction from opec and if we were to see a deeper curtailment on russian oil and you know would the united states then tap more into the spr we re now at you know we re down to seven hundred thousand barrels which of course is not insignificant but we also sort of have to be you know judicious about how we use the spr but thank you for the question faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from michael let s see trevett a ph d candidate at the university of southern mississippi china and other countries claim there are petroleum reserves under the south china sea what are your estimates of the potential amount there and has china begun to extract any of this oil kissane michael thank you so much that s a great question so china already is an oil producing country so you do have oil production in china in the south china sea i can t i can t say exactly i know that there have been geological tests that have shown the reserves again you do have you know you do have territorial concerns about sort of where is this you know can china can china tap those or seek to explore and tap those reserves again if there are if there is contention over the territory in which these reserves are located so you know china again one of the things that s very interesting about china is that china is an oil producer but china has seen over the last you know the last decade they have seen that they have experienced peak demand so i mean sorry peak supply so they are not producing as much as they used to and so you re seeing a year on year reduction in the producing capacity you know if you go back maybe five or six years ago there was lots of questions about if china could kind of replicate what happened in the united states around the shale oil revolution i think one of the big challenges for china is that of the you know where the shale reserves are located it s not near water lots of questions as to and some of it basically some of the tests have shown that it s it definitely is proving harder that you know they cannot sort of model the same level of development that we have seen in the united states so yeah no i think in the south china sea again i think we it s potentially possible that we might see it i wouldn t i wouldn t i wouldn t say it s soon faskianos thank you i m taking the next question from rob warren at the anglo american university of prague this question also got an upvote how do you foresee venezuela s role in the global oil market changing moving forward and can it be reintegrated into the global economy kissane oh these are all fantastic questions thank you all so much yeah venezuela is again you know venezuela has they have the largest reserves in the world as part of this webinar right you cfr had a kind of a primer on venezuelan and kind of you know you look at sort of where venezuela is and one of the biggest challenges confronting venezuela is both its politics but it s also it basically you know you don t have you don t have international oil service providers in the country i think the only the only one now that the u s the u s has sort of given a sanctions exemption to is that of chevron but i think yeah i mean if you were to see you know kind of shifts in the political regime and you were to see more openness then i think you could imagine you know venezuela having an opportunity or a pathway forward to be more integrated into the global energy system and the global oil system you know i think one of the big problems that venezuela faces is that most of its infrastructure is really old at this point and it would need a significant amount of reinvestment to get it up to a place that it could sort of meet its potential so you know venezuela is one of these countries that s not producing as much as it could right it has the potential to be producing 2 million plus more barrels per day but you know we ve seen that they really have just they went into freefall so i think that s a big issue and another big issue which god it goes back to an earlier question is that of emissions so the oil that comes out of venezuela is a very very heavy oil so it s it has very large carbon emissions associated with the production of that oil so that i think is again as we you know think about the emissions from oil production in countries that are sort of seeking to kind of market themselves as low emission producers you know venezuela definitely will have a very hard time recouping its where its oil sector was again it has the capacity it has the reserves but getting that getting that oil out of the ground right now you have a lot of significant above ground risks faskianos thank you i m going to go next to clemente abrokwaa raised hand so please unmute yourself q can you hear me please faskianos yes we can q thank you thank you so much for your for your talk i was also very shocked about the amount of barrels that we consume every day laughs i didn t know that but anyway i m from penn state university and my question is you just mentioned about the above ground you know effects and so the movement towards like electric vehicles and so on how do you think it is going to affect the african continent kissane thank you q i am i m thinking you know the economies and then infrastructure it will be very difficult for them to laughs move with the rest of the world in terms of electric vehicles and so on i just wanted your take on that kissane thank you clemente it s an excellent question yeah i mean you have countries across the african continent that not only have oil reserves but are already producing right nigeria is a is an oil producing country also has more capacity but again you have some above ground risks you also have the need for investment of new infrastructure i think one of the things that has been very interesting and i think it s getting it s getting more attention as it deserves is how western governments are some of i think a challenge across africa is that a lot of western governments have sort of said listen we re not going to invest in fossil fuels or also financial institutions western financial institutions we re not going to invest in fossil fuels or new projects that are fossil based and that you know that s problematic when you look across the african continent where you still don t have you know 100 percent energy access you know the idea of the transition to electric vehicles which is taking a very very long time even here across the across developed economies so the need for the infusion of more capital to go into you know across the continent of africa for oil and gas that s for their economies and for their own economic growth i think is really really pivotal and i think this is something that you know is being discussed across multilateral financial institutions and also you know is it hypocrisy right for western banks that have you know kind of funded the oil and gas industry or helped to fund the oil and gas industry in the united states and many different parts of the world and that are now sort of not allowing those funds to flow to africa and they have the again they have the they have the resources so you know is it you know the equity of some of these decisions that are being made i think is one that s is one that s really important and again i you know i said earlier in this talk is that you know all most of the demand for oil is not coming from north america and from europe all of the demand that we re seeing and new demand that we re going to see is coming from asia and is going to come from africa so again you know how are we going to make sure that that demand is met again going back to that idea of energy security so there is there is accessibility so there is reliable sources of energy at affordable prices you know without sort of thinking about kind of a whole of energy approach so i think it s very it s a very complex issue and i think you know western banks who have sort of taken very sharp positions on what they will and will not fund when it comes to new oil and gas projects are getting sort of challenged as to you know what does that mean then for you know countries across africa that are still very much in need of more energy not less and again recognizing that you know evs that again are still are you know we re seeing adoption here in the united states and across europe but it s a big big big adoption in china but it s very uneven so how do we ensure greater energy security for the continent of africa i think is a really critical question faskianos thank you i ll take the next question from kyle bales who is a senior at lewis university in romeoville illinois how is the war between russia and ukraine having an effect on the progress of the european green deal maybe you can tell us what the european define the european green deal for us carolyn give us the context for that kissane yes so again this is another fantastic question yeah the european green deal it s this is this is great yeah i mean a lot of people would say that the european green deal now is that the russia s invasion of ukraine has sort of said hey this is why the green deal is so important this is why we really need to more quickly transition to renewable energy because look what look what happened when we were dependent on russia for over 30 percent of our natural gas and look when russia you know illegally invades ukraine and suddenly weaponizes gas we are left very energy insecure it affects it affects consumers it affects industry across the continent so i think we re seeing not just through the green deal but we re also seeing through sort of european green industrial policy so in some ways akin to what you know we put into effect in this past summer is the inflation reduction act and we re seeing almost kind of this industrial competition around clean energy technologies and so europe is investing you know i think it s about 250 billion the united states it s about 370 billion towards the kind of the energy transition and helping to support domestic industries and companies to you know to be able to you know develop the technologies and to have the you know the opportunity to contribute to the energy transition so i think one thing though whenever i talk about europe it s really important is to sort of recognize that you know when you look across europe you have very different policies and kind of approaches to sort of thinking about energy and how quickly some countries want to transition and can transition whereas others you know are probably going to experience a slower transition so just really interesting example as you talked about the green deal is the eu taxonomy the green taxonomy that went into effect in the january of 2022 and there you had like really a lot of contention between france and germany because france wanted to make sure that nuclear was part of the green taxonomy germany was opposed right but germany wanted to make sure natural gas was part of the green taxonomy so ultimately in the end both natural gas and nuclear and again this was this predated russia s invasion of ukraine but in the eu green taxonomy you have you know you have both nuclear and natural gas in addition to other renewable energies that can make up this taxonomy that includes specific measures towards adaptation and mitigation for climate change so you know i think you re seeing this kind of some people call it a race a competition you know ideally it s you know we re kind of working together to because we re all sort of going in the same direction to you know support the transition and to reduce to reduce carbon emissions and to bring in more sort of cleaner energy technologies into our system faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from dr laeed zaghlami q yes good afternoon this is laeed good afternoon irina good afternoon carolyn i m very pleased to be part of your program just to want to be back to africa and particularly to nigeria how practical the two projects that nigeria is advocating for pipelines one from through algeria and the other one to morocco through western african countries how practical are these pipelines to supply gas to europe and parts of some african countries faskianos and dr zaghlami you are at algiers university correct q indeed irina yes i am professor at university of algiers faculty of information and communication faskianos thank you kissane dr laeed can i can i keep you on for just one second can i ask you what is the what is the status right now is it it s planned under construction where is what is the status of those two pipelines my understanding is that it s they re proposed but q yes well actually in practically the pipeline between algeria and abuja which means through niger and so forth is already in progress whereas the other project through thirteen western african countries they are supposed to be implemented by 2047 but is it is there any political game or something of strategic inaudible how practical how logical how efficiently will be for nigeria to have two similar project s kissane yeah no it s again thank you for the question you know pipelines again that s why i wanted to show the laughs kind of the map of pipelines is because you know a lot of pipelines transverse you know multiple countries right and this is this requires not just you know a lot of cooperation but it requires technically it also can be very complex to build to build pipelines and when you re talking about something like as you as you point out these are you know crossing many countries you know i think one of the again one of the issues is whether or not since you know what already is under construction i think you can you know with confidence that one will be completed anything that s not yet under construction and again the timeline 2047 is way out there a lot of a lot of uncertainty as to what the status of those projects will be moving forward for various reasons in terms of making sure that the investments are there someone i know that studies pipelines he says you know until the steel is in the ground you don t have the pipeline and so until you know that you ve got that you know you ve got all the oks and you feel that kind of security of being able to build it and being able to provide the resources to supply it and to move it i think algeria has been a really interesting case that hasn t gotten enough attention in terms of algerian gas that has that has helped support europe over the last years we ve seen an increase in algerian gas going into europe again a lot of attention on u s lng and the increase of liquefied natural gas exports into europe but also algeria has been you know very important for helping to support european energy security and make up for some of the losses of the of the russian gas and i think we ll see more attention on algeria and algeria s role as a you know as an important source of energy especially you know gas going into going into europe moving forward faskianos so i ll take the next written question from vincent brooks who is at harvard and diamondback energy board of directors how do you view the purchasing of discounted russian oil by india in particular relative to the purchasing by china how are they using the oil purchased and are you seeing more internal usage or external profit making sales in places like africa and what are the implications of all of this kissane right great great question so all of the above laughs in some ways right there is definitely sort of profits that are being made you know i was i was talking about this last week with someone and you know if you sort of put your shoe put yourself in the shoes of india right so india is a is a rapidly growing economy 1 4 billion you know if you had if you have very high energy inflation and high oil prices that s going to have ripples effects across the indian economy and so you know when you have a kind of opportunity to buy you know pretty steep discounted oil which you know they had been able to buy from russia you know for purposes of national security they ve been buying the oil and one of the things that s very interesting about india is that actually india has been building out its refining capacity so a lot of that oil is both for domestic and some of it is being sort of re exported but i think what we ve seen is that they re using that oil to also sort of enhance their capacity and capabilities as a rapidly emerging refining power in asia and we see that in some ways in china too so china even though oil demand was down in 2022 much of the oil that they were buying from russia went into its strategic supplies which you know they now have access to and again i think you know a big question is what we re going to see moving forward around oil demand in china wood mackenzie just published a really interesting piece kind of very bullish on the expectations for oil demand in china so whether or not they re going to continue to buy you know russian oil and again sort of taking advantage of these lower prices you know and i think i think one of the things that it s kind of an inconvenient truth whereas a lot of this oil trading used to happen in europe so european trading houses were kind of the main the main points of russian oil trade a lot of that has been moved out so you know russia has found ways to kind of bypass some of the sanctions and have set up in some cases they ve set up trading houses and some of those trading houses have been sort of set up in places that you know that they can sort of again bypass the compliance to the sanctions and you have some you have some russian oil traders that are making a lot of money laughs selling discounted oil and then reselling it a really interesting case a couple of months ago was out of malaysia malaysia announced or in the you know that they were that 1 5 million barrels were produced and sold but only malaysia doesn t produce that much so those were russian barrels that were sort of being sold under sort of the malaysian under the malaysian barrel so again i think china and india have you know have taken advantage some of this has again as i said has been re exported and some of it you know has been re exported through petroleum products because china and india you know both are building and have refining capacity faskianos thank you i m going to take the next question from bhakti mirchandani at columbia university what global trajectory do you see for nuclear the russia ukraine crisis has taken some of the refining capacity offline and nuclear has the potential to change the geopolitics of energy and so what steps can be taken to foster nuclear energy kissane bhakti thank you and i was just at columbia earlier today for the center for global energy policy s conference yeah nuclear is very interesting right so when we re thinking about you know decarbonizing our energy systems you know nuclear plays a very important role because it s zero emitting so in certain parts of the world china being one saudi arabia you know you have a lot of new nuclear build you know in other parts of the world you have a lot of contention about nuclear we saw that even in germany which have you know three remaining nuclear power plants and even in the midst of massive energy crisis over the last year there was still sort of pushback about no those nuclear power plants need to be shut down whereas you would think ok in light of energy insecurity let s keep them open so you know france is an interesting country france had planned to reduce its nuclear capacity by 50 percent but this past year they pivoted and they ve said no we re actually going to build out more nuclear and we re sort of we re totally scrapping that idea of reducing nuclear energy and nuclear is very important for france s electricity system sweden has also announced that they are going to build new nuclear and they re going to increase by i think almost 50 percent again part of this is their to meet their targets of net zero we also see japan japan you know the fukushima disaster really turned japanese the japanese public off of nuclear very very deep opposition to restarting the nuclear power plants but this past year even though there s still safety concerns on the part of the public the public is also very concerned about energy insecurity and higher prices so nuclear being a domestic source of energy so i think when you look at you know net zero pathways i have not seen a net zero pathway that does not include nuclear so here in the united states the net zero america project out of princeton very important place for nuclear we just have a really hard time laughs building nuclear at cost so it s very expensive usually it s significant cost overruns and of course there is the i think they have a really significant pr problem people there s still a lot of concern about the safety of nuclear so i think to your point it s very very important for decarbonizing energy systems but you re going to see i think very disjointed approaches some countries are going are embracing nuclear and other countries are sort of doubling down on their opposition and are not going to allow nuclear to be part of the energy system faskianos we have so many questions and we are just not going to get to them all so i m going to take the next question from christian bonfili who s at torcuato di tella university in argentina so do you think carolyn that the landscape resulting from the ukraine invasion by russia vis à vis securitization of gas and energy between europe and russia could accelerate energy transition toward greener energy kissane great question i think in europe it is and i think you know many analysts would agree that the iea for example you know you had the you know how does europe continue you know to enhance and achieve energy security without the dependence on russia gas and a lot of that is through renewable energy you also have a lot of new attention on hydrogen and the role that hydrogen will play i think i think europe is being cautious and so they are not saying that they are going to completely move away from gas so as earlier questions are they getting gas from algeria or are they getting gas from norway are they getting more gas from the united states in the form of liquefied natural gas and then also an uncomfortable truth is they continue to get liquefied natural gas from russia so we ve seen an increase in lng from russia going into europe that said i think all in you are seeing that you know countries across europe are saying ok you know how can we enhance our energy security how do we build more sort of domestic energy sources solar wind we re seeing you know more rapid deployment you ve got a lot of questions about supply chains and things like that but i think overall i think the answer would be that it s quickening the energy transition faskianos so i will take the moderator prerogative to just ask the final question for you to close on and just to give us your top three what are the major challenges for the geopolitics of oil as you look out over the next five to ten year horizon that you would leave us with to be looking for kissane ok you know so i think what we saw right tensions between saudi arabia and the united states we also have a you know a hot war cold war depending on you know the term you want to use between the united states and china and lots of sort of questions as to what that s going to look like i think there s you know i think there s concern that you know we re not reducing demands but we re seeing tightening supply and so that s going to have you know very significant impacts for economies especially economies that are already very fragile economically fragile politically fragile so that concerns me a lot in terms of you know what happens when you know economies don t have adequate access to energy to make sure that their industries that their that consumers you know are able that the lights can stay on and you can get you know if you re dependent on cars you re depending on trucks like all these kinds of things are really really critical so i think we have to be very cautious moving forward that we don t take more out of the system before we have adequately set up the system to be resilient and to be able to sort of meet the energy security demands that are not are not they re not decreasing i think they are increasing and becoming even more complex so i think there s a lot of concerns and a lot of uncertainty and you know this definitely is going to be an area to watch in the years ahead faskianos carolyn kissane kissane excuse me thank

amid crippling sanctions and threats of military intervention in venezuela many have put forward two options support regime change or support the government of nicolás maduro but this is a false choice instead the u s left can follow the lead of the popular working class sectors in venezuela who have long maintained a complicated relationship to the chavista government these movements show that criticism of the government leftist in name but increasingly prone to corruption and repression doesn t mean support for the right wing u s backed opposition in fact healthy critique has been necessary to advance the socialist project for progressives abroad solidarity with venezuelans begins by loudly and unequivocally rejecting u s intervention the scale of venezuela s crisis is both undeniable and all consuming hyperinflation has made goods and services inaccessible even to those with dollars water service is so sparse that weekly calendars are planned around when faucets may run cooking gas shortages have led some to turn to wood burning for fuel public transit is so devastated that commutes have ballooned from minutes to hours an exodus of millions has sapped the vitality of neighborhoods once teeming with youthful energy it s just too much i heard again and again from friends and strangers alike while in caracas earlier in january it wasn t always so in 1999 hugo chavez swept into the presidency after nearly two decades of growing misery austerity and state violence under the banner of bolivarian revolution he promised to make government more responsive to the needs of the poor crafting a new constitution that promoted participatory democracy and redistributing oil rents in ways that brought major demonstrable improvements in healthcare food security education transportation and more for millions of venezuelans once marginalized by the state but traditional middle class and elite sectors sidelined by chavista governments focus on the poor mounted at times violent and antidemocratic opposition to hugo chávez and upon his death in 2013 maduro this cemented deep class cleavages that have long prevented major popular sector support for anti chavismo even amid deep crisis yet popular support for chavismo was never uncomplicated or automatic anyone who has spent more than passing time with residents of venezuela s sprawling urban barrios can confirm that stinging criticism of the government has long been common in chavismo s early years popular sectors inspired by chávez s rhetoric of empowerment demanded follow through in the form of greater control over state resources often taking to the streets against state institutions and officials deemed weakly committed to the kind of radical change chavez increasingly promised at other times they took to the polls helping hand chávez his only electoral defeat in 2007 in a failed constitutional reform that sought to concentrate rather than delegate power meanwhile amid a historic boom in oil prices that improved quality of life unrestrained corruption also ballooned in the absence of institutional oversight exchange controls fed currency speculation and a new bolivarian bourgeoisie in stark contrast with chávez s increasingly socialist rhetoric following chávez s death maduro s election by a razor thin margin emboldened radical sectors of the opposition in 2014 to take up anew violent street protests against the government at the same time oil prices collapsed and the tension between funding social programs and corruption could no longer hold this limited maduro s ability to enact major reforms leading instead to a siege mentality that increasingly looked inward to state officials and the security apparatus rather than to social movements and popular sectors for support as the economic crisis took hold in earnest discontent within working class quarters rose leading to significant abstention that gave the opposition control over the national assembly in 2015 and later to the violent repression not only of opposition protests but of popular sectors too under the guise of anti crime operations today as news reports polls and my own interviews show there is a widespread sense that a government once committed to their wellbeing has largely abandoned them swallowed up by massive webs of corruption inefficiency and violence recent weeks have exploded these tensions as never before corruption mismanagement and both existing and new u s imposed sanctions have further deepened venezuela s economic crisis sparking popular sector protests that the state has met with deadly force in the process sapping support for maduro among even in erstwhile chavista areas at the same time the united states offers increasingly vocal support for opposition leader juan guaidó who declared himself interim president on january 23 and the trump administration pushes ever harder for regime change even threatening military intervention once again venezuela s popular sectors are caught between a rock and a hard place for progressives abroad solidarity with venezuelans requires embracing rather than eliding a complex and fast moving political landscape a multi pronged approach aimed at addressing both the immediate threat and the longer term barriers to social justice in the country foreign and domestic that begins by loudly and unequivocally rejecting u s intervention even if the record of u s involvement in the region were not sufficiently sordid to sound alarms the fact that war hawks such as marco rubio john bolton and elliott abrams are helming u s policy on venezuela should confirm that democracy human rights and humanitarianism are no priority military options would prove catastrophic in the short term as even some opposition sectors begrudgingly admit they would also scuttle any effort to generate stability in the medium term laying the grounds for a puppet regime with little credibility beyond its backers domestically and abroad but rejecting u s intervention must also mean rejecting nicolás maduro lifting up critical popular sector voices and refusing to feed into discourse that paints him as democratically legitimate or a true leftist not as an empty gesture to fairness but because maduro s government has long proven an obstacle to social justice in venezuela one of his first policy announcements upon being sworn into a new six year term in january was a 1 billion euro plan to beautify major cities this constituted a major affront to the poorest in venezuela facing medicine food and currency shortages meanwhile minimum wage increases have immediately been vaporized by a galloping inflation and though distribution of subsidized food provides some relief its delivery is sparse and irregular mired in major webs of corruption more troubling still is the state repression barrios have increasingly faced at the hands of special police forces ostensibly aiming to combat known criminals but whose record of extrajudicial killings with impunity sows far more fear than security to reject both intervention and maduro means to support venezuelans right to determine their future free from pressures foreign or domestic maduro s reelection last may was marred by irregularities beyond just the opposition boycott including media blackouts on the leading challenger henri falcon but even before maduro had already sacrificed what for many was a dearly held legacy of chávez electoral legitimacy first by arbitrarily delaying gubernatorial elections in 2016 then by sidelining grassroots candidates for the national constituent assembly in 2017 these moves raise important questions about maduro s standing that require resolution by venezuelans themselves in free and fair elections truly free elections would require a field that includes chavismo even as trump and some sectors of venezuela s opposition might rather eliminate socialism from the political landscape solidarity therefore means supporting elections where chavismo and socialist candidates can participate fair elections also require lifting international sanctions in order to allow venezuelans to exercise their right to choose their future without influence from abroad to be sure such a scenario remains distant and with every passing day venezuelans suffering grows now aggravated by harsh u s sanctions with even stronger ones imminent restricting the venezuelan government s ability to raise money for imports including of food and medical supplies no one therefore should accept u s arguments that concern for venezuela s humanitarian crisis drives its push to deliver aid to the country a claim flatly rejected not only by maduro but also by local and international aid organizations like the red cross and caritas finally progressives abroad must resist a growing narrative that uses the last five years of economic crisis in venezuela to retroactively cast the entire chavista project even socialism itself as an unmitigated failure doomed from the start this ignores the ways that chavez s government redistributed income and resources and benefited people s lives downplaying why chavismo continues to elicit sympathies and advancing false claim that opposition to maduro today translates into opposition to chavismo writ large it also scrubs the record of often violent and anti democratic opposition which sought to oust chavismo even when chavez s aims were reformist rather than radical in its early years there is a pressing need especially on the left to reckon honestly with what went right and wrong in 20 years of chavismo we must understand how proven gains in poverty reduction health access food security and global standing were reversed by a host of factors including overreliance on oil concentration of power and policies derided even by progressive economists like currency exchange controls and gasoline subsidies that ultimately had less to do with socialism or anti imperialism than with fueling corruption but doing so effectively begins by resisting efforts to cast this process as preordained and instead to draw lessons positive and negative from two decades of left wing governance while maduro and his international allies constitute a bulwark against the pretensions of the united states and its domestic partners progressives abroad must embrace the criticism of those who have struggled often with at other times against the government of maduro in pursuing a better venezuela the future of a truly just venezuela hangs in the balance

this press release contains references to terms and financial measures commonly used in the oil and gas industry but that do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by international financial reporting standards ifrs in canada and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies such terms and financial measures are referred to as non gaap measures the non gaap measures used in this press release are described below non gaap measures should not be used to make comparisons between companies including cequence total revenue is a non gaap measure that represents production revenue gross of royalties and including realized gain loss on commodity contracts management utilizes this measure to analyze revenue and commodity pricing and its impact on operating performance funds flow from operations is a non gaap measure that represents cash flow from operating activities before adjustments for decommissioning liability expenditures proceeds from the sale of commodity contracts and changes in non cash working capital the company evaluates its performance based on earnings and funds flow from operations the company considers funds flow from operations to be a key measure as it demonstrates the company s ability to generate the cash flow necessary to fund future growth through capital investment and to repay debt the company s calculation of funds flow from operations may not be comparable to that reported by other companies funds flow from operations per share is calculated using the same weighted average number of shares outstanding used in the calculation of income loss per share operating and cash netback are non gaap measures operating netback equals total revenue less royalties operating costs and transportation costs cash netback equals the operating netback less general and administrative expenses and interest expense management utilizes these measures to analyze operating performance net debt is a non gaap measure that is calculated as working capital deficiency excluding commodity contracts plus the principal value of the term loan previously the senior notes which reflects the estimated amount that will be repaid upon maturity cequence uses net debt as it provides an estimate of the company s assets and obligations expected to be settled in cash finding and development f d costs and finding development and acquisition fd a costs have been calculated in accordance with ni 51 101 f d costs are calculated by dividing the sum of the total capital expenditures for the year in dollars by the change in reserves within the applicable reserves category in boe f d costs includes all current year net capital expenditures excluding property acquisitions and dispositions with associated reserves including changes in future development capital fdc on a proved or proved plus probable basis fd a costs are calculated by dividing the sum of the total capital expenditures for the year including both costs and associated reserve additions related to acquisitions net of any dispositions during the year by the change in reserves within the applicable reserves category further information on how the company calculates f d and fd a costs is available in the company s annual information form filed on sedar management uses f d costs and fd a costs as a measure to assess the performance of the company s resources required to locate and extract new hydrocarbon reservoirs including the effect of acquisitions and dispositions the aggregate of the exploration and development costs incurred in the most recent financial year and the change during that year in estimated future development costs generally will not reflect total finding and development costs related to reserves additions for that year f d and fd a costs used by cequence may not be comparable to similar measures used by other issuers recycle ratio is measured by dividing the operating netback by appropriate f d or fd a costs per boe for the year operating netback is calculated using production revenues including realized gains and losses on commodity hedging less royalties transportation and operating expenditures calculated on a per boe equivalent basis reserve replacement ratio measures the amount of reserves added to a company s reserve base during the year relative to the amount of oil and gas produced management uses these oil and gas metrics for its own performance measurements and to provide shareholders with measures to compare the company s performance over time oil gas disclosure advisories this press release contains estimates of the net present value of the company s future net revenue from its reserves such amounts do not represent the market value of the company s reserves boes are presented on the basis of one boe for six mcf of natural gas disclosure provided herein in respect of boes may be misleading particularly if used in isolation a boe conversion ratio of 6 mcf 1 bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead for fiscal 2018 the ratio between the average price of west texas intermediate wti crude oil at cushing and nymex natural gas was approximately 20 1 value ratio the value ratio is obtained using the 2018 wti average price of 65 20 us bbl for crude oil and the 2018 nymex average price of 3 20 us mmbtu for natural gas this value ratio is significantly different from the energy equivalency ratio of 6 1 and using a 6 1 ratio would be misleading as an indication of value the company s estimate that it has 50 net montney locations on its west simonette lands including in the 50 locations are 26 locations included in the glj report and 24 additional wells identified by management to be prospective the company identifies 24 net dunvegan oil wells prospective on its land there are 8 wells identified in the glj report and the remainder are based on

washington president trump s 4 75 trillion budget proposal unveiled on monday brims with confidence that the united states economy will continue to expand rapidly despite recent data suggesting growth is slowing mr trump told reporters last week that the economy is very very strong his budget proposal forecasts 3 2 percent growth in 2019 which would be a slight increase from last year and the strongest rate since 2005 it estimates similarly strong growth for the next decade enough to eventually reverse the expansion of the federal budget deficit under mr trump s watch but there are signs in the indicators mr trump watches closely that his economic policies are beginning to work against his economic goals waning stimulus from mr trump s 2017 tax cut and economic damage from his global trade war are undermining the president s oft stated objective of increasing growth and reducing america s trade and budget deficits
tom brenner the new york times washington president donald trump s 4 75 trillion budget proposal unveiled monday brims with confidence that the u s economy will continue to expand rapidly despite recent data suggesting growth is slowing trump told reporters last week that the economy is very very strong his budget proposal forecasts 3 2 percent growth in 2019 which would be a slight increase from last year and the strongest rate since 2005 it estimates similarly strong growth for the next decade enough to eventually reverse the expansion of the federal budget deficit under trump s watch but there are signs in the indicators trump watches closely that his economic policies are beginning to work against his economic goals waning stimulus from trump s 2017 tax cut and economic damage from his global trade war are undermining the president s oft stated objective of increasing growth and reducing america s trade and budget deficits the federal reserve and congressional budget office both expect 2 3 percent growth for the year a group of economists surveyed monthly by the wall street journal now predicts 2 2 percent growth for the year trump s tariffs on steel aluminum and 250 billion worth of chinese imports are beginning to raise consumer prices and could push inflation much higher if they are left in place or expanded that could force the fed to resume its path of raising interest rates which trump has repeatedly criticized as impeding the economy the administration s own budget projections show 1 trillion deficits for the next four years and no balanced budget for 15 years even with assumptions of strong economic growth trump s 1 5 trillion tax cuts have driven much of the deficit increase federal tax collections from businesses and individuals fell 9 percent in january compared with the year before along with spending increases he signed when republicans controlled both chambers of congress white house officials insist the tax cuts will eventually pay for themselves through revenue growth most economists disagree and most budget hawks expect trump to rack up larger deficits than his budget predicts another key metric trump watches the trade deficit is also widening the gap between the goods america buys from its trading partners and the goods it sells grew to a record high in 2018 despite trump s focus on narrowing that deficit few of these developments have surprised economic forecasters who have long warned that trump s economic policy initiatives would undermine his overarching goals trump s tariffs on steel aluminum and chinese imports have hurt u s exports as trading partners imposed retaliatory tariffs and chinese officials stopped buying key u s products like soybeans perhaps more consequentially forecasters say although the president s signature tax cuts fueled economic growth last year they also helped widen the trade and budget deficits the trade deficit and budget deficit are inherently related said diane swonk chief economist at grant thornton when you blow a hole in your budget deficit you need to rely more on the rest of the world for your borrowing many economists say fading stimulus from the corporate and individual tax cuts is driving their growth projections below 3 percent for this year but that too is not a surprise the slowdown in growth is in line with our expectations said alexander arnon a senior analyst at the penn wharton budget model at the university of pennsylvania which projects 2 2 percent growth this year about half the drop off from 2018 arnon said was attributable to the end of the immediate boost to the economy from the tax cut package trump signed in late 2017 increased federal borrowing to fund the tax cuts may account for much or all of the rise in the trade deficit arnon said foreigners purchased up to 100 billion in additional u s debt last year using dollars they got from selling more products to america trump has said little recently about the trade or budget deficits like most of his predecessors he has accentuated positive statistics to promote his stewardship of the economy including a 3 8 percent unemployment rate and in data released friday by the labor department the fastest wage growth in a decade strong growth has buoyed the president s approval ratings on economic issues gallup reported last week that 56 percent of americans approve of his handling of the economy and 54 percent approve of his handling of unemployment well above the 43 percent who approve of his performance overall slower growth could threaten those ratings goldman sachs reduced its forecast for first quarter growth monday to just 0 5 percent after new data showed weakening consumption over the last several months if that forecast proves correct the economy would need to average 4 1 percent growth for the next three quarters to reach trump s 3 2 percent goal for the year trump and his advisers are confident that growth will speed up this year because they see tax cuts continuing to increase investment in the economy and entice more americans particularly those older than 50 back into the workforce the chairman of trump s council of economic advisers kevin hassett said growth could be higher than 3 2 percent this year if trump completes a trade deal with china that bolsters u s exports past white house budgets have often overshot in their predictions for the next year s growth hassett said he was confident that was not the case this year because his team s forecasts did not prove overly optimistic in either 2017 or 2018 he said the slowing growth of recent months most likely reflected chronic seasonal factors and temporary damage from the prolonged government shutdown at the start of the year and would be reversed in the months to come if the data come in different from our projections we have to explain why and consider a revision to our forecast hassett said this year we don t see any reason to do that trump and some of his advisers view the fed as the biggest obstacle to meeting growth targets this year the president has publicly and privately criticized the fed for interest rate increases that he warns could chill growth the fed paused its upward march in rates this year and chairman jerome powell has promised a patient approach to future increases powell appearing sunday on 60 minutes on cbs said that patient means that we don t feel any hurry to change our interest rate policy some of trump s confidants want the fed to go further to increase growth stephen moore a campaign economic adviser to trump is pushing for the fed to cut interest rates immediately to counteract a decline in commodity prices that followed rate increases at the end of 2018 the fed is sucking the oxygen out of the economy and has created an economically debilitating deflation moore said citing three consecutive months of declines in the consumer price index which remains up 1 5 percent from a year ago and a 10 percent drop in commodity prices since november he called for the fed to reverse its september and december rate increases which would mean cutting interest rates by half a percentage point the one guy who gets this is trump moore said he told me in a meeting last month that the fed is preventing us from staying on a 3 to 4 percent growth path powell has shown no indication that the fed is looking to cut rates we ve seen a bit of a slowing in growth powell said but still to healthy levels in the u s economy this year so the u s economy does seem to be favorable the outlook for the u s economy is favorable

pay for themselves through revenue growth most economists disagree and most budget hawks expect trump to rack up larger deficits than his budget predicts another key metric trump watches the trade deficit is also widening the gap between the goods america buys from its trading partners and the goods it sells grew to a record high in 2018 despite trump s focus on narrowing that deficit few of these developments have surprised economic forecasters who have long warned that trump s economic policy initiatives would undermine his overarching goals trump s tariffs on steel aluminum and chinese imports have hurt u s exports as trading partners imposed retaliatory tariffs and chinese officials stopped buying key u s products like soybeans perhaps more consequentially forecasters say although the president s signature tax cuts fueled economic growth last year they also helped widen the trade and budget deficits the trade deficit and budget deficit are inherently related said diane swonk chief economist at grant thornton when you blow a hole in your budget deficit you need to rely more on the rest of the world for your borrowing many economists say fading stimulus from the corporate and individual tax cuts is driving their growth projections below 3 percent for this year but that too is not a surprise the slowdown in growth is in line with our expectations said alexander arnon a senior analyst at the penn wharton budget model at the university of pennsylvania which projects 2 2 percent growth this year about half the drop off from 2018 arnon said was attributable to the end of the immediate boost to the economy from the tax cut package trump signed in late 2017 increased federal borrowing to fund the tax cuts may account for much or all of the rise in the trade deficit arnon said foreigners purchased up to 100 billion in additional u s debt last year using dollars they got from selling more products to america trump has said little recently about the trade or budget deficits like most of his predecessors he has accentuated positive statistics to promote his stewardship of the economy including a 3 8 percent unemployment rate and in data released friday by the labor department the fastest wage growth in a decade strong growth has buoyed the president s approval ratings on economic issues gallup reported last week that 56 percent of americans approve of his handling of the economy and 54 percent approve of his handling of unemployment well above the 43 percent who approve of his performance overall slower growth could threaten those ratings goldman sachs reduced its forecast for first quarter growth monday to just 0 5 percent after new data showed weakening consumption over the last several months if that forecast proves correct the economy would need to average 4 1 percent growth for the next three quarters to reach trump s 3 2 percent goal for the year trump and his advisers are confident that growth will speed up this year because they see tax cuts continuing to increase investment in the economy and entice more americans particularly those older than 50 back into the workforce the chairman of trump s council of economic advisers kevin hassett said growth could be higher than 3 2 percent this year if trump completes a trade deal with china that bolsters u s exports past white house budgets have often overshot in their predictions for the next year s growth hassett said he was confident that was not the case this year because his team s forecasts did not prove overly optimistic in either 2017 or 2018 he said the slowing growth of recent months most likely reflected chronic seasonal factors and temporary damage from the prolonged government shutdown at the start of the year and would be reversed in the months to come if the data come in different from our projections we have to explain why and consider a revision to our forecast hassett said this year we don t see any reason to do that trump and some of his advisers view the fed as the biggest obstacle to meeting growth targets this year the president has publicly and privately criticized the fed for interest rate increases that he warns could chill growth the fed paused its upward march in rates this year and chairman jerome powell has promised a patient approach to future increases powell appearing sunday on 60 minutes on cbs said that patient means that we don t feel any hurry to change our interest rate policy some of trump s confidants want the fed to go further to increase growth stephen moore a campaign economic adviser to trump is pushing for the fed to cut interest rates immediately to counteract a decline in commodity prices that followed rate increases at the end of 2018 the fed is sucking the oxygen out of the economy and has created an economically debilitating deflation moore said citing three consecutive months of declines in the consumer price index which remains up 1 5 percent from a year ago and a 10 percent drop in commodity prices since november he called for the fed to reverse its september and december rate increases which would mean cutting interest rates by half a percentage point the one guy who gets this is trump moore said he told me in a meeting last month that the fed is preventing us from staying on a 3 to 4 percent growth path powell has shown no indication that the fed is looking to cut rates we ve seen a bit of a slowing in growth powell said but still to healthy levels in the u s economy this year so the u s economy does seem to be favorable the outlook for the u s economy is favorable back to top

in the autumn of 2013 former us treasury secretary larry summers proposed in a seminal speech at the international monetary fund headquarters in new york that the global economy had entered a long term economic slump invoking a previously discredited 1930s theory known as secular stagnation summers argued that it may have become all but impossible to boost growth by using the age old trick of lowering interest rates to encourage more investment and consumer spending the answer he argued was for governments to spend more instead summers would go on to suggest that secular stagnation may be the defining macroeconomic challenge of our times there followed a major debate between heavyweight economists about whether he was right but for several years the global economy contradicted him by growing steadily now however this looks to be at an end look no further than the oecd projections from march 6 which foresee all advanced economies growing much more slowly than anticipated a few months ago the left hand chart below shows the oecd projections from last may while the right hand chart shows the latest outlook complete with red arrows to indicate the sharpest downward revisions the overarching global theme seems to be donald trump s trade war and the fact that central banks have been tightening monetary policy the us federal reserve has hiked interest rates four times in the past year while the european central bank is no longer printing money through its programme of quantitative easing there are additional local reasons such as uk fears about a hard brexit or excessive levels of private sector debt in china underlying all of this however is the growing feeling that secular stagnation is a major drag behind the scenes back in fashion the theory was originally put forward in 1938 by the harvard economist alvin hansen in response to the great depression he argued that america s economy was suffering from a lack of investment opportunities linked to waning technological innovation and not enough new workers due to an ageing population too little immigration and the closing of the old economic frontier in the american west in hansen s view the weak growth in the economy was therefore here to stay secular means long term in this context yet he would soon be proved spectacularly wrong as world war ii provided a big temporary boost to the economy in the form of military spending followed by a post war baby boom and rapid technological progress in the 1950s and 1960s little more was heard of secular stagnation until larry summers intervention at the core of the theory today is real interest rates this refers to the long term interest rate meaning the rate of return on ten year government bonds after inflation has been stripped out for example if a country s long term interest rate is 1 but the rate of inflation is 2 5 the real interest rate is 1 5 when you take a global average of real interest rates from different countries my own research shows that the global rate has declined from more than 5 in the early 1980s to below 0 after the financial crisis of 2007 09 today real interest rates remain negative in many advanced economies including japan sweden switzerland and the entire eurozone summers has pointed to several structural factors behind this long term decline in an echo of what appeared true in 1938 rich countries are ageing as birth rates decline and people live longer this has pushed down real interest rates because investors think these trends will mean they will make lower returns from investing in future making them more willing to accept a lower return on government debt as a result other factors that make investors similarly pessimistic include rising global inequality and the slowdown in productivity growth it is a major paradox that labour productivity the most important source of long run economic growth is actually rising much slower today than for decades even though technological progress has seemingly accelerated this decline in real interest rates matters because economists believe that to overcome an economic downturn a central bank must drive down the real interest rate to a certain level to encourage more spending and investment this is referred to as the level required to reach full employment because real interest rates are so low summers and his supporters believe that the rate required to reach full employment is so far into negative territory that it is effectively impossible the remedy summers argues that this problem is why the massive cuts to headline interest rates after the financial crisis did not solve the problem in other words monetary policy was actually much less expansionary than many people believe even though quantitative easing was actually helpful here not only that there is now substantial evidence that austerity policies in places like southern europe made things significantly worse the upshot is that in the eurozone and elsewhere there is little or no room to cut interest rates when the next recession comes probably fairly soon given the current expansion is already a few years old central bankers will meanwhile be wary of using more quantitative easing since it has generated a lot of political backlash so what to do instead interestingly the one country not to have had a recession in almost 30 years is australia which has enjoyed very high population growth and has never seen interest rates as low as many countries this suggests that in the long run more immigration might be a vital part of curing secular stagnation summers also heavily prescribes increased government spending arguing that it might actually be more prudent than cutting back especially if the money is spent on infrastructure education and research and development of course governments in europe and the us are instead trying to shut their doors to migrants and austerity policies have taken their toll on infrastructure and public research this looks set to ensure that the next recession will be particularly nasty when it comes alvin hansen may have been wrong in the 1930s but his analysis is looking increasingly persuasive today unless governments change course radically we could be in for a sobering period ahead

deal or no deal trade talks between the u s and china the world s two largest economies have reached a critical phase yet mixed signals coming from the white house and beijing are causing analysts to question whether president donald trump and his chinese counterpart president xi jinping will be able to finalize an agreement to end a costly trade war by early april as originally predicted white house press secretary sarah sanders told reporters on monday that the two sides haven t set a date yet for a signing summit between trump and xi to end the dueling tariffs that are hurting both countries economies in an appearance on fox news over the weekend white house economic adviser larry kudlow said that negotiations are making great progress however last week the chinese side reportedly canceled tentative plans to have xi travel to president trump s florida retreat mar a lago at the beginning of april for a signing ceremony causing some analysts to question whether an agreement is truly imminent trump has repeatedly touted progress in the talks but warned that he would pull out of the negotiations if he concluded he wasn t getting a good enough deal he s going to make a deal if it s in the best interest of america sanders said if he doesn t feel like it s a good deal it s not worth just signing a piece of paper any deal negotiators reach is likely to address u s concerns with what it sees as unfair trade practices by the chinese government to advantage its domestic industries over foreign competitors it is also expected to include provisions that would reduce the trade deficit between the two countries most likely through chinese government directed purchases of u s commodities like soybeans and liquefied natural gas hanging in the balance is a crucial relationship that accounted for 710 billion in two way trade in 2017 according to the office of the u s trade representative that trade also supported about 911 000 u s jobs in 2015 the latest year for which that data is available high political stakes but the political stakes for the two leaders are nearly as great as the economic ones and both trump and xi must be able to extract major concessions from the other in order for the negotiations to be successfully concluded analysts say if an agreement is finally reached between china and the united states in the trade war it will certainly be a win win outcome said mei xinyu a researcher with the chinese academy of international trade and economic cooperation in beijing if one side wins and the other side loses an agreement cannot be reached trump is coming off a failed nuclear summit with north korean dictator kim jong un last month undercutting his claims of deal making mastery the white house has been praising trump s decision to use tariffs on a wide array of chinese goods to drag beijing to the negotiating table however despite the president s claims to the contrary economists have found that the full burden of the tariffs is actually being passed on to u s manufacturers and consumers in the form of higher prices while u s farmers are being punished by retaliatory sanctions levied by china in addition last week the administration received two doses of bad economic news on friday the labor department reported surprisingly low job growth in february that followed the announcement by the commerce department on tuesday that the u s trade deficit excluding services hit its highest level in history at 891 billion in 2018 including services on which the u s runs a surplus the total trade deficit was 621 billion a 12 5 percent increase over the previous year the factors driving the increased trade deficit are many and varied and often have little or no connection to the administration s trade policies but for president trump who promised to quickly eliminate the trade deficit those numbers pose a real political problem while president xi currently faces no major challenge to his leadership of china he is effectively president for life a slowing economy and a stock market battered by fallout from the trade dispute make reaching a deal at least as much of a priority for him as it is for trump striking an agreement with trump on a large package of chinese purchases of american agriculture and manufacturing products will be the easiest thing for the chinese to do because it doesn t force them to make any internal change in their economy said william reinsch of the center for strategic and international studies trump s success or failure in the talks will be largely measured by the number of economic and structural changes he extracts from the chinese government to provide the u s with more of a competitive edge in the future but that won t be easy so the big number today may cause the president to focus more on chinese purchases and less on the harder things we re asking them to do added reinsch who is the scholl chair in international business at csis no half baked deal however not all experts on trade with china see this as a likely outcome erin ennis executive vice president of the us china business council said that neither side has much incentive to accept a half baked deal neither side seems interested in compromising for the sake of compromise ennis said in many ways the concern that has been expressed here in the united states about the president settling for a weak deal are messages that are actually being voiced in china as well about concern that president xi might settle for a weak deal neither side has any sort of motivation to agree to something that doesn t have at least something that s in its interest the u s is the destination for 19 percent of all chinese exports according to world bank data this means that the near term health of the chinese economy is dependent on the ability of its companies to sell to the u s market on thursday it was announced that china s exports in february were 21 percent lower than they had been the previous year marking the third straight month of decline the trade battle with china began last summer when in a series of back and forth moves the u s imposed tariffs on chinese imports and beijing retaliated with levies of its own by december when the two countries agreed to temporarily halt the escalation about 200 billion in chinese imports faced 10 percent tariffs in the u s and another 50 billion faced a 25 percent charge in china 50 billion worth of goods imported from the u s faced a 25 percent tariff and another 60 billion in imports faced levies of between 5 and 10 percent tariffs were scheduled to ratchet up yet again on march 1 but trump announced a delay in late february saying substantial progress had been made in talks led by u s trade representative robert lighthizer and chinese vice premier liu he the sticking points the u s and chinese negotiating teams are treading familiar ground as they work toward a deal many of the complaints that the trump administration is seeking to address have been raised by former u s presidents and businesses for years for example china has a long and well documented history of ignoring the intellectual property rights of foreign companies and individuals american businesses have repeatedly complained about the government supported theft of trade secrets by chinese firms any deal that fails to bind china to greater respect for intellectual property rights would be largely viewed as a failure for the trump administration another issue also related to intellectual property rights is what s become known as forced technology transfer for many foreign firms handing over data on proprietary technologies and innovations has become a de facto requirement for operating within the chinese market u s negotiators are seeking an end to that practice chinese lawmakers are reportedly drafting legislation that would address many of the intellectual property concerns that trouble foreign firms u s negotiators however will want to see signs of a commitment to enforcement beyond the simple passage of a new law chinese government s economic controls one of the widest gaps between the u s and china is on the question of government involvement in the economy while the u s government is generally expected to take a laissez faire approach to businesses operating within the law and applicable regulations the chinese government plays a far more active role the government owns many businesses outright and offers industrial subsidies to others while the attitude in the u s is that these practices create an unfair playing field beijing defends them as necessary to its plan to drag the massive chinese economy into the modern era by developing high value industries quickly the problem according to jeffrey schott a senior fellow with the peterson institute for international economics is that beijing and washington are operating on very different timelines in beijing he said they are trying to maintain substantial rate of growth of the economy to facilitate the adjustment needed in their labor force but they are trying to do it in a way that does not undercut the authority of the communist party that places them in conflict with the priorities of the u s which would like to see china take quick and decisive action to cut state intervention in the economy it can t happen in the time period that is desired by u s politicians because they and especially the president want immediate gratification schott said it s in the interest of the chinese officials to have an incremental transition but they are willing to look at a longer horizon than u s political leaders can do because u s leaders have to answer to the electorate and chinese leaders don t u s negotiators will also be looking for the chinese to roll back restrictive regulations that make it difficult for u s businesses to operate in china particularly rules that limit the ownership stake that a non chinese individual or corporation can hold in ventures doing business there also in play are rules that make it extremely difficult for foreign firms to gain regulatory approval for products in certain industries such as biotechnology the chinese legislature is expected to put forward proposed legislation that would accomplish many of these goals in the near future guarantees against currency manipulation given china s history of manipulating the value of its currency the renminbi u s negotiators will also be seeking guarantees that beijing won t artificially lower its value against the dollar in order to make exported chinese products relatively less expensive than similar products made by foreign competitors also essential to the u s will be some sort of enforcement mechanism that guarantees that china actually takes steps it commits to in negotiations this is a trickier proposition than it might seem because it would likely require the chinese government to allow a degree of foreign monitoring of its interactions with domestic industries a level of transparency rarely seen in beijing s relations with the outside world finally any deal is also expected to include a provision under which the chinese government agrees to direct spending toward u s commodities like soybeans or liquefied natural gas lng in an effort to reduce the trade deficit between the two countries economically speaking such an arrangement would likely make little real difference to the u s economy in the near term except insofar as suppliers who had lost business due to tariffs would be getting it back the soybean and lng china purchases won t represent new u s production but rather a change only in who does the buying given how much president trump has invested in making the trade deficit with china a political symbol however it is considered unlikely that he would agree to a deal that doesn t let him claim a win on that particular issue but without the more important structural changes in china s economy and trade practices said derek scissors a resident scholar with the american enterprise institute we will be right back in a situation where you know we have been in for some time
kuala lumpur malaysia mar 12 ips after discrediting state owned enterprises privatization advocates successfully pushed a broad reform agenda under the rubric of privatization from the 1980s with the support of the washington based international financial institutions privatization has been central to the neo liberal counter revolution from the 1970s against government economic interventions associated with roosevelt and keynes as well as post colonial state led economic development many developing countries were forced to accept privatization policies as a condition for credit or loan support from the world bank and other international financial institutions especially after the fiscal and debt crises of the early 1980s other countries voluntarily embraced privatization often on the pretext of fiscal and debt constraints in their efforts to mimic new anglo american criteria of economic progress jomo kwame sundaram demonizing soes globally inflation was attributed to excessive government intervention public sector expansion and state owned enterprise soe inefficiency it was claimed with uneven and dubious evidence that soes were inherently likely to be inefficient corrupt subject to abuse and so on in the 1970s the motives of many involved in the preceding public sector expansion enabled by high commodity prices and earnings as well as low real interest rates due to easy credit with the need to recycle petro dollars invest revenues from petroleum exports were developmental and noble regardless of their original rationale or intent many soes become problematic and often inefficient yet privatization is not and has never been a universal panacea for the myriad problems faced by soes only more pragmatic and appropriate approaches recognizing their origins roles functioning impacts and problems can realistically expect to address and overcome the burdens they have come to impose on many developing economies various meanings privatization usually refers to a change of ownership from public to private hands over recent decades the term has been used more loosely for example it may only involve minority private ownership after the corporatization of an soe and the sale of a minority share of its stock or even a majority share with control remaining in state hands by various means such as the use of a golden share it sometimes also refers to contracting out services previously undertaken solely by the government the definition may include cases where private enterprises are awarded licenses to participate in activities previously reserved for the public sector strictly speaking however privatization involves the transfer of at least a majority share of and a controlling interest in a public enterprise or soe and its assets or an entity such as a government department a statutory body or a government company previously controlled and typically at least majority owned by the government either directly or indirectly mainstreaming privatization following the oil price shocks of the mid and late 1970s inflation spread through much of the world us president jimmy carter appointed paul volcker as chairman of the us federal reserve in 1980 the us fed sharply raised interest rates to stem inflation which precipitated the fiscal and debt crises of the early 1980s in many parts of the world especially in latin america africa and eastern europe the unexpected sovereign debt crises forced many countries to seek emergency financial support from the international monetary fund imf and the world bank wb both headquartered in washington dc the imf provided emergency credit facilities requiring price stabilization programmes to bring down inflation typically blamed on deficit financing due to macroeconomic populism generally the wb worked closely to provide medium and long term credit to these governments on condition that they adopted structural adjustment programmes saps the saps generally prescribed economic globalization especially of international trade and finance national or domestic deregulation and privatization since then these international financial institutions have been more powerful in relation to developing countries than ever before soon privatization became a standard requirement of saps thus many governments of developing countries were forced to privatize by the saps loan conditions many other governments voluntarily adopted such policies which became standard pillars of the emerging washington consensus associated with the wb the imf and the us policy consensus of the 1980s privatization in developing countries was preceded by the political counter revolution associated with the rise and election of margaret thatcher as the prime minister of the united kingdom and ronald reagan as the president of the united states of america jomo kwame sundaram a former economics professor was united nations assistant secretary general for economic development and received the wassily leontief prize for

the issuance of foreign denominated global bonds by the government has contributed to strengthening the country s foreign exchange reserve position bank indonesia announced on friday t he issuance of foreign denominated global bonds by the government has contributed to strengthening the country s foreign exchange reserve position bank indonesia bi announced on friday foreign exchange reserves were recorded at us 123 3 billion in february higher than the 120 1 billion that was booked in january the central bank estimated the current foreign exchange reserve level was adequate to finance 6 9 months of imports or 6 7 months of imports and payment of the government s short term external debt the foreign exchange reserve level was well above the international adequacy standards of about three months of imports bi governor perry warjiyo said in jakarta on friday that the latest foreign exchange reserves figure was more than adequate for indonesia for the payment of its short term external debt imports financing and to act as buffer for the central bank in stabilizing the rupiah s value the increased foreign exchange reserve was more than enough to finance the imports short term external debt and for stabilizing the rupiah s exchange rate said perry the increase of foreign exchange reserves was driven by the issuance of global sukuk sharia compliant bonds as well as by foreign exchange receipts from the oil and gas sector bi said in a statement the government had issued 2 billion in global sukuk last month which comprised a 750 million green global sukuk with 5 5 years maturity and a 1 25 billion sukuk with 10 years maturity the increased foreign exchange reserve level however was occurring at a time when the rupiah was slightly weakened because of risk off sentiments in the market which led to a stronger united states dollar the rupiah weakened to rp 14 223 against the greenback on friday down from its previous day s level of rp 14 129 per us dollar data from the jakarta interbank spot dollar rate jisdor revealed the rupiah s position in the spot market was even weaker at rp 14 314 per us dollar down by 1 21 percent according to data from bloomberg perry said the central bank would maintain its presence in the foreign exchange market to stabilize the rupiah along with its fundamental value while also maintaining the market mechanism he added that the rupiah s depreciation over the past week was mainly driven by external risk off factors that boosted the greenback such as positive manufacturing data from the us the european central bank s ecb dovish statement upward movement of global oil prices and geopolitical factors such as uncertainties over brexit and the failure of a recent us and north korea summit to produce a positive outcome global factors brought risk off sentiments which led to a strengthened us dollar against other currencies including the rupiah said perry adding that domestic factors remained positive marked by low inflation and incoming foreign portfolio capital among other things tokyo based economist eric sugandi said the factors cited by perry were likely to be temporary while identifying that a potential downturn in the global economy as well as in the us and chinese economies in 2019 and 2020 was a potential threat to the rupiah s value in the long run the slowdown of the us and china s growth could suppress indonesia s exports which would weaken the fundamental support from indonesia s economy for the rupiah s said eric persistent depreciation of the rupiah s value may force bi to intervene in the market to stabilize the currency a move that would deplete the foreign exchange reserves said center of reform on economics core indonesia research director piter abdullah however he said that the external development remained tilted to the downside marked by a slowdown in global growth and a dovish stance by the united states federal reserve the dovish global environment would likely be more influential in the long term slight pressures on the rupiah and a maintained foreign exchange reserve said piter adding that indonesia would have the opportunity to build up its foreign exchange reserves as the rupiah stabilized
ankara turkey s economy fell into its first recession in a decade official data showed on monday just weeks before president recep tayyip erdogan s government faces local elections when growth and inflation will be key issues for voters economic output contracted by 2 4 percent in the final three months of the year compared to the third quarter on a seasonally and calendar adjusted basis the turkish statistics institute tuik said that followed a contraction in the third quarter two consecutive quarter on quarter contractions in economic output is widely considered to be the definition of a recession the flagging economy coupled with a currency crisis last year that battered the lira are sensitive issues for erdogan and his ruling justice and development party akp before the municipal vote on march 31 the turkish leader in power since 2003 first as prime minister and then as president has often boasted of the country s strong growth during his time in government erdogan is frequently credited for the economic turnaround after the 2001 financial crisis and the far reaching reforms spearheaded by a former economy minister after turkey sought credit from the international monetary fund growth came in at 2 6 percent for 2018 overall but that was still much lower than the 7 4 percent recorded in 2017 a turbulent period following the 2016 failed coup and terror attacks the economy shrank by 3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared with the same period the previous year inflation has also remained high it struck a 15 year peak in october at 25 24 percent before falling below 20 percent in february with food prices hit particularly hard erdogan s government has sought to curb consumer prices especially for produce consumed everyday in turkish households turkish authorities last month set up their own vegetable stands in a bid to force markets to lower food prices but analysts said economic data showed inflation was still weighing on household consumption and domestic demand was weak before the local elections erdogan is trying to keep food prices in check but after the elections food inflation will probably rise further nora neuteboom economist at abn amro told afp turkish finance minister berat albayrak who is also erdogan s son in law said on twitter the data was as expected but the worst is behind us that analysis was shared to some extent by the london based capital economics research firm but they offer cold comfort for turkey s economic outlook while the worst of the downturn may now have passed the weak carryover means that we expect gdp to decline by 2 5 percent this year said jason tuvey senior emerging markets economist at capital economics albayrak blamed the recession on speculative attacks and the current global economic slowdown neuteboom said abn amro expected the turkish economy to contract in the first three quarters of 2019 before showing positive growth in the last quarter but we cannot really say that the worst is behind us as turkey enters a long period of subdued economic growth she said the last time turkey entered a recession was in 2009 after the global economic crisis hit foreign and domestic demand neuteboom said it will take a rather long time for turkey to get back to trend growth turkey s economy was hit hard when us president donald trump doubled tariffs last year on turkish steel and aluminium during a bitter row over a detained american pastor the lira plummeted in value in august reaching a record of 7 against the dollar the turkish currency lost nearly 30 percent against the us dollar in 2018 despite rallying especially after the pastor s release in october while an aggressive interest rate hike in september helped brake its fall economic activity stalled while prices of goods shot higher
last thursday the european central bank ecb abandoned its previously proclaimed policy of ending free money handouts to the banks through quantitative easing qe programmes and zero interest rates these policies introduced to prevent the complete collapse of the european banking system after the 2008 world financial crash were supposed to be ended by the ecb on the grounds that the crisis was over and the banks no longer needed bailing out by the working class the eu and eurozone the ecb assured everyone was undergoing economic expansion that had made austerity cuts and endless attacks on workers worth all the pain late in the day the ecb has been forced to recognise that far from the economic crisis of capitalism being consigned to the past its policy of pumping trillions of worthless euros into the banks to prop them up has backfired instead of economic growth in the eu countries from italy to the supposedly economic powerhouse of european capitalism germany manufacturing industry is collapsing and these countries are being shoved into recession on thursday the head of the ecb mario draghi ruled out any increase in interest rates a central plank of the ecb s optimistic plans and to turn on the money taps to the banks again under a mechanism called targeted longer term refinancing operations tltros the initials may have changed from qe to tltro but the policy remains to hand over free or cheap money to banks in the hope that they will use this windfall to lend to companies who will use it to invest and so boost the real economy it didn t work last time and it won t work again the banks seeking a safe haven for their loans rather than risky ones to companies that were producing no real profits used it to buy up government bonds which they assumed would always meet massive interest payments and provide them with massive profits as sovereign states are not supposed to go bankrupt they believed that at the end of the day these countries would always find the money for repaying any loans out of cuts to government spending in short they relied on the working class of every country in europe to pay for keeping the banks from going under through even more savage austerity cuts this has created the doom loop that has got financial analysts so worried the banks rely on the country to be able to pay for its loans and the governments rely on these loans to pay for their spending the failure of either part of this doom loop means the entire banking system and along with it the state collapses into bankruptcy the futile attempt to hold capitalism together after 2008 by creating trillions of worthless money to flood the world s banks only succeeded in inflating the world debt crisis to the point of explosion one analyst quipped that tltro in reality stands for the last try to restore optimism not for any real prospect of saving capitalism from a monumental crash optimism is in short supply for the capitalist class as they are being torn apart by trump s trade war to bankrupt america s capitalist rivals while facing a mass movement of workers and youth refusing to pay for the bankers crisis in britain it has led to the complete breakup of the two party system as the ruling class tries to deal with how to keep tied to a rapidly collapsing capitalist eu in the face of an intransigent working class determined not to allow the referendum result to be overturned by any parliamentary coup what is clear is that the economic and political collapse of capitalism must be resolved by the working class taking power and putting an end to this bankrupt system and advancing to a socialist society that will expropriate the banks and industry and place them under the management and for the benefit of all the people this calls for the building of revolutionary parties of the fourth international in every country to lead the coming socialist revolution throughout europe to victory
the world economy risks remaining weak for a bit longer last friday alone reports showed the slowest us hiring in more than a year a slump in chinese exports and an unexpected decline in german factory orders with economies already undershooting expectations by the most since 2013 and the organisation for economic cooperation and development slashing its forecasts worries are mounting that the recent slowdown will last for longer although recession fears for now remain limited the soft patch puts the united states and china under pressure to settle their trade war which has bludgeoned sentiment and leaves central banks needing to keep monetary policy looser than they were planning into this year such forces may still prove enough to drive a pick up and next week witnesses further health checks ranging from retail sales data in the us to industrial statistics from china and the euro zone the trends in the global economy have certainly concerned markets said investec chief economist philip shaw in london it s material enough to make a difference to the policy outlook the week ended with news that us payrolls grew just 20 000 last month way below the 180 000 median forecast in a bloomberg survey of economists deutsche bank is already warning the us economy could grow less than 1 per cent this quarter and the bout of labour market weakness will sew worries about the spending power of consumers today in washington the government will release retail sales data for january after december witnessed the worst slump in nine years elsewhere exports from china tumbled almost 21 per cent last month the most in three years while german factory orders unexpectedly dropped 2 6 per cent in january the most since june that was just one day manufacturing purchasing manager indexes are in contraction territory in china japan and the euro area where there s mounting concern that the bloc s economy and markets risk repeating japan s lost decades of growth there are caveats us wage gains were the fastest of the expansion last month and jpmorgan chase co predicts salaries in rich nations will start advancing by more than 3 per cent this year financial conditions have also turned more relaxed after tightening into the end of last year with the msci world index of stocks up almost 9 per cent this year there s a case that as we move through this that growth will pick up in the second half of the year said mr david hensley director of global economics at jpmorgan in new york there are supports to keep things from getting too weak much will depend on whether presidents donald trump and xi jinping can resolve their trade dispute clearing a fog of uncertainty that s stopping businesses from investing and hiring if the united kingdom can avoid tumbling out of the european union without a divorce deal that would also help mr trump postponed an increase in tariffs that had been scheduled to be imposed on china this month but no date has been set for the two leaders to meet and much remains unsettled confidence that differences will narrow is one reason morgan stanley economists say this quarter will mark the trough of the global slowdown another case for optimism that the worst may soon be over is that some governments and central banks are starting to dole out aid the problem there is that they will then have less firepower to deploy if growth really falters china last week announced a cut to its value added tax of as much as 800 billion yuan s 162 billion as it lowered its goal for growth to a range of 6 per cent to 6 5 per cent for this year down from about 6 5 per cent last year and the european central bank became the first of the major central banks to unveil more stimulus in the form of new cheap loans for banks which came alongside a commitment not to raise interest rates until 2020 source bloomberg

the government of president lenin moreno besieged by corruption charges has embarked on an imf dictated austerity program entailing mass layoffs that is bringing it into increasingly open confrontation with the ecuadorian working class the first round of layoffs targeting 10 000 part time and hourly workers took effect on march 1 the most affected areas are education and healthcare agustín lindao leader of the national union of public health ministryworkers osumtramsa reported layoffs of 2 500 to 3 500 between casual and temporary contractors doctors emts nurses pharmacy assistants social workers and operation personnel at least 1 000 workers saw their jobs terminated at the ministry of education 200 of them in guayas at the institute of social security iess 500 employees were fired the layoffs are the first step by the moreno government in meeting the demands of the international monetary fund imf for sweeping austerity measures in return for a 4 5 billion deal signed with the financial agency on february 20 the total cuts demanded under the agreement amount to 10 percent of the public workforce or 50 000 jobs last month thousands of workers marched in the capital of quito to denounce the threat of massive layoffs bound up with the imf deal as well as privatizations and a punishing rise in fuel prices the march was followed by a national strike called by the ecuadorian trade unions on february 13 in the face of mounting anger among the workers thousands of workers and peasants blocked traffic at several main arteries burning tires in quito manabí el oro and zamora where they managed to partially stop commercial activities hispantv said the protest was against moreno for violating his government plan and supporting interventionism in venezuela moreno became president in may 2017 and has seen his popularity plummet from 77 percent when he first took office to 30 percent today according to reuters moreno was the vice president and hand picked successor of his predecessor rafael correa who was first elected in 2007 after running as a self proclaimed socialist on a populist program the government s reformist promises made during the commodities boom ran into the realities of falling oil prices and the deceleration of the chinese economy the turn towards austerity measures directed against the working class begun under correa has been rapidly accelerated under moreno who has broken with and turned against the former president the evolution of the ecuadorian government formerly included in hugo chavez s bolivarian alliance is part of the general receding of latin america s so called pink tide of nationalist populist bourgeois governments and the rise of right wing administrations including those of the fascistic former army captain jair bolsonaro in brazil and the extreme right wing multimillionaire mauricio macri in argentina conditions for the working class in ecuador are steadily deteriorating a report issued this week revealed that the share of the country s workforce employed in the so called informal sector without regular work wages or benefits rose to 46 percent last year moreno s turn to the right has been accompanied by a shift in policy towards julian assange the founder of wikileaks who has lived as a refugee in the ecuadorian embassy in london since 2012 the increasingly onerous conditions imposed upon assange which began under correa have accompanied a bid by the moreno government to achieve a rapprochement with us imperialism including through support for the regime change operation in venezuela the threat is that assange will become a bargaining chip in in this process under conditions in which he faces espionage and or conspiracy charges in the us that could result in his execution in the midst of carrying out the attacks demanded by the imf on the working class moreno has been accused by the opposition his formal allies in the bourgeois populist revolución ciudadana citizens revolution party of embezzlement and corruption since he took office in may 2017 he has had three prime ministers the first two resigned to face corruption charges the current one is jorge glass also out of the ranks of revolución ciudadana representative ronny aleaga of revolución ciudadana house has filed a complaint against the president before the ecuadorian prosecutor s office over the purchase of a holiday property in alicante spain aleaga accuses moreno of having established in march 2012 ina investments an offshore company based in the tax haven of belize that was owned by his brother edwin moreno garcé until it was dissolved in 2016 ina bought real estate fancy cars crocodile leather wallets and other luxury items however what is significant about the investigation is that ina investment did not limit itself to moving money so that moreno s family and its associates could live in wealth the corruption case takes on a greater dimension in that ina was used to facilitate contracts with the state the complaint filed by representative aleaga estimates that this was an operation involving about us 65 million meanwhile investigative reporters christian zurita ron and fernando villavicencio revealed a transfer of us 18 million from sinohydro a chinese state company to the company recorsa managed by lenin moreno s close friend conti patiño together with the president s wife rocio gonzalez and sinohydro received a contract from the ecuadorian government for the construction of the coca codo sinclair dam east of quito the largest public infrastructure project in the country s history cost estimated at us 2 8 billion we are seeing how the presidential family of ecuador has given itself a great life with money coming from sinohydro bribes while the people suffer mass layoffs fuel hikes insecurity ineptitude and indifference from the authorities aleaga said in a recent radio interview meanwhile moreno has accused his predecessor correa of corruption denouncing him for having paid close to us 5 billion for four projects whose real dollar value should have been about half that correa is also charged in ecuador with responsibility for the botched kidnapping of an opposition lawmaker in colombia he has denied the charges insisting that they are part of a political witch hunt mounted by the moreno government
yesterday evening the streets of algeria erupted with joy after the announcement that the hated de facto dictator for life was withdrawing from the presidential election scheduled for april no fifth term for bouteflika was the rallying cry of the masses for weeks now it seems that they have achieved their goal president abdulaziz bouteflika has announced that he will not stand for a fifth term this withdrawal is a big victory for the masses in action over a regime that did not want to budge the latest estimate france24 11 march put the number of participants in the daily demonstrations at somewhere between 10 and 15 million at their height out of a population of 40 million this scope of these mobilisation has not been seen since the country achieved independence in 1962 the call for a general strike on social media was also gathering momentum since yesterday but this sent shockwaves through the ruling class several layers of which seemed to be abandoning bouteflika or at least hedging their bets by not supporting him outright besides the imams and judges declaring their newly discovered independence from the regime the head of the army in a cryptic message announced that the army shares the same goals as the people there can be no doubt a real political storm has broken out the ruling class is now trying to manoeuvre in order to regain the initiative they are afraid that should they continue their former intransigent position they would risk being overrun completely by the revolutionary wave thus they are trying to give concessions in order to buy time and peace but the exaltation of the masses is nevertheless mixed the decision not to run in the next presidential elections does not mean bouteflika has resigned quite the contrary it is a manoeuvre of his clan of generals and businessmen to remain in power the announcement yesterday evening included more measures the presidential elections have been postponed sine die no new timetable has been set a national conference of whom will be convened to establish a new constitution that will be submitted to a referendum at the end of the year then and only then will there be new presidential elections the daily demonstrations were 10 15 million strong image eric blanc but again no precise dates have been set until then bouteflika will preside over a technocratic government this means in reality an extended fourth term for the president already hashtags are circulating on the algerian social media demanding no extended fourth term leave means leave has also quickly become a popular slogan ali dilem an algerian cartoonist drew a caricature of mr bouteflika announcing he would not pursue a fifth term instead i ll do a fourth term of ten years the president says other measures confirm the stubborn desire of the ruling clique to stay in power the government has been reorganised with the aim of strengthening the clan around the president they know they have to try to deceive in order to stay in power intimidation and repression have not worked so they are trying to win time instead but weeks of mobilisation in defiance of the regime has increased the consciousness of the masses they have learned more in those weeks than in years of passivity the victory of yesterday will embolden them they will want more especially the youth the majority of the algerians are younger than 30 years want the whole mafia of bureaucrats generals and businessmen out of power they must all leave commented young demonstrators yesterday already a new day of mobilisation is announced for this friday 15 march the battle of algiers has just begun the below article was first published in arabic on 6 march before the latest events since 22 february there have been mass demonstrations throughout algeria these are the largest protests since the al aroush movement in june 2000 the marches began when president abdelaziz bouteflika s office announced his intention to run for a fifth term this proved to be the straw that broke the camel s back in terms of the accumulated anger of the algerian youth although this movement seemed to appear out of nowhere it has not been an isolated event in fact 2018 has seen a rise in popular struggles the most prominent of which have been strikes by doctors education sector workers and the strong popular uprisings in bashar and ouargla in southern algeria a turning point these protests in their depth size and combativeness mark a new phase in the history of class struggle in algeria and the region as a whole the algerian regime was able to weather the storm of the revolutions that spread through north africa and the middle east since 2011 this was achieved by a combination of material concessions for some layers and by threatening a return to the years of civil war that algeria experienced during the 1990s these criminals in the regime have long blackmailed the algerian people by dredging up the bloody decade during which the army and the islamists collaborated to wreak havoc throughout the country and to kill at least 200 000 people they still repeat the same song against the recent protests the price of restoring algeria s security and stability was huge and it is important to maintain this precious achievement said deputy defense minister and army chief of staff lieutenant general ghaid saleh in a speech after the protests he added proper objective thinking must bear consideration of the security accomplished after the bloody years experienced by algeria although the price to restore algeria s security and stability was great prime minister ahmed ouyahia also did not forget to remind everyone who would listen of this period he referred to it several times especially in his speech in parliament he also used the threat of syria s experiences in recent years what he really means is either surrender and submit to us or we will unleash the forces of hell upon you but the demonstrators responded to him in the streets by saying ouyahia algeria is not syria the decision not to run in the next presidential elections does not mean bouteflika has resigned it is a manoeuvre of his clan of generals and businessmen to remain in power image magharebia what we see today in the streets of algeria is evidence that it is now the ruling class who are afraid while the algerian people are raising their heads again and regaining their great revolutionary traditions faced with the heroism of the masses which were not stopped by tear gas batons and arrests the ruling gang was forced to make concessions quickly indicating the magnitude of the terror they feel immediately after the outbreak of protests the official news agency announced that bouteflika had removed his campaign manager and former prime minister abdelmalek sallal replacing him with the current transport minister abdelghani zaalan but this only led to further protests because it was seen as nothing but a manoeuvre to maintain the rule of the clique around bouteflika bouteflika himself has disappeared from public life after a stroke he suffered in 2013 it is believed that he is nothing but a puppet a corpse in the real and political sense of the word that is controlled by a gang of cronies around him on sunday the ruling clique issued another statement on behalf of this corpse it declared bouteflika s intention to not complete his presidential term if he wins on 18 april and to organise early presidential elections in which he will not be a candidate and because words are cheap the authors of that statement promised everything under the sun they said in the name of the president i am determined if the algerian people elect me again to assume the historical responsibility to respond to your fundamental demands that is regime change he also pledged to prepare a new constitution that enshrines the birth of a new republic and a new algerian regime as well as the establishment of urgent public policies that will allow the equitable redistribution of national wealth the elimination of all marginalisation and social exclusion etc in this way the ruling clique wants to divide the movement so that it can regain the initiative but if these gangsters really imagine the algerian people will believe these promises and be fooled by their manoeuvre they have lost all contact with reality this was proved by the algerian people who treated the statement with the contempt it deserved and stepped up their protests accident and necessity the immediate reason behind this popular uprising is the widespread rejection of the nomination of bouteflika as a presidential candidate for a fifth time but this was merely an accident that expressed a deeper necessity a great deal of anger and indignation has accumulated over many years of cuts looting and repression waiting under the surface for an opportunity to express itself this last provocation was the spark that lit the powder keg algeria is a rich country the largest in africa 2 381 741 square kilometres four times the size of france and its most important source of wealth is its youth who represent the majority of the population under 25s represent 46 percent of the population the unemployment rate has grown from 10 5 percent in 2016 to 11 1 percent in 2018 it has particularly hit young people and women reaching 26 4 percent among young people aged 16 to 24 and 20 percent among women algeria is also the world s fifth largest natural gas producer and 13th in oil production these wellsprings of wealth supplied the state budget during the period between 1999 and 2014 i e the reign of bouteflika with 750 billion dollars this kind of money could permanently eliminate poverty and unemployment in the country and rebuild algeria several times over at all levels given an economic and political system based on the democratic planning of the economy and popular control over wealth however despite this enormous wealth algeria is a country with deep problems the president s visit to switzerland for medical checks is one of a thousand indications of this it demonstrates that after 25 years of rule and 57 years of independence there is still not a single hospital that he trusts to provide him with treatment the promises made in the ruling clique s latest statement about its intention to develop urgent public policies that would ensure the equitable redistribution of national wealth and eliminate all social marginalisation and exclusion are further proof of their own political bankruptcy the bankruptcy of the capitalist class and the ruling gang is clearly exposed in their parasitic dependence on oil and natural gas revenues instead of investment in education infrastructure industry the environment or any other societal good this has made the country vulnerable to fluctuations in energy prices thus after energy prices fell in the international market from 2014 and onwards oil revenues fell by 70 percent according to official figures foreign currency reserves also fell to 93 billion from 114 billion in 2016 it is expected to drop to 76 billion in 2020 equivalent to 17 months of imports the country s debt increased from 20 4 percent as a proportion of gdp in 2016 to 32 9 percent in 2018 and for the first time in quarter of a century the country recorded a trade deficit 13 7 billion in the wake of these economic setbacks the government has launched brutal austerity policies forcing the workers and poor to shoulder the burden of the crisis caused by the policies of the ruling class since independence they have recently announced that the algerian people will have to endure difficult times as a solution to the mounting economic problems they have resorted to mass layoffs they also intended to abandon subsidies for many basic goods such as oil and to reduce the value of the dinar to increasingly make the poor pay for the crisis since 2014 the dinar has lost 48 percent of its value compared to the dollar the inflation rate reached 7 5 percent in 2018 along with this economic bankruptcy of the ruling class we also witness their political bankruptcy after 20 years of bouteflika s rule and more than five decades of independence there is no democratic freedom in algeria something even those who wrote bouteflika s statement had to admit for example algeria is classified by the united nations as a non free country in terms of political freedoms and in 2017 it ranked 134 out of 180 countries concerning press freedom the regime is afraid the regime believed that things were under control and that order was settled which was reflected in the arrogance with which they dealt with popular demands and all forms of opposition then came this movement which they did not expect and whose strength they underestimated it turned everything upside down the dilemma of the ruling gangsters is that they do not have much room to manoeuvre unlike in the past they no longer have billions of dollars on hand to make financial concessions to the masses especially given the significant decline in oil and gas prices and the amount of waste and corruption rampant in the state their song about the historical legitimacy the legitimacy of the algerian revolution and the struggle against colonialism no longer convinces anyone everyone knows that they are just a gang that confiscated the rights of the algerian people looted the country and turned it into a farm of the imperialist companies french americans and others i e the same crimes that the masses wanted to break with through the revolution the criminal blackmail they are waging against the people by submission to security by raising the spectre of the red years every time they face a mass movement no longer works especially on young people for whom the only terrorism they have known in their lives is the state terrorism it is possible that the ruling clique cornered by these protests may resort to terrorist attacks here and there or at least to allow them to take place in order to derail the revolutionary movement but it is highly unlikely that they would risk returning to the years of civil war after they burned their fingers and their interests were severely damaged the algerian working class is one of the strongest working classes in the region and on the continent as a whole it has a long history of struggle and great revolutionary traditions image fair use they are now facing a real impasse their retreats before popular demands will reveal their impotence increase the confidence of the masses and embolden their demands but the regime s intransigence threatens to increase public anger and should the protests draw in new layers and affect more regions this will deepen the splits at the top in war as in chess there comes a stage where a move in either direction retreat or attack could still lead to defeat and the ruling gang in algeria has reached this situation but they are not the only ones who are afraid of the great rise of the algerian people all the regimes of the region feel the heat under their backsides the algerian working class is one of the strongest working classes in the region and on the continent as a whole it has a long history of struggle and great revolutionary traditions thus its rise and triumph will inspire all the peoples of the region and the whole continent indeed the masses on the streets of sudan since february started to raise slogans of solidarity with the movement in algeria and the leader of the rif movement in morocco nasser zafzafi sent a message to the algerian youth from his cell expressing his solidarity with them the imperialists especially the french are following these events with concern this is normal because what is happening in algeria certainly affects france the algerian regime plays the role of france s obedient dog in the region amidst the so called war on terrorism and in restricting migration they also have significant interests in algeria in terms of investments and trade the latter of which amounts to 5 billion a year as algeria is one of the largest importers of french wheat and an important provider of energy providing 10 percent of france s requirement of gas etc the most important factor is the presence of a large algerian working class in france which has a great revolutionary tradition and is involved in the mass struggles that recently broke out in france they are also following with interest and sympathy events in their country of origin and are very angry at the complicity between the french ruling class and the ruling gang in algeria what frightens the french ruling class and algerian gangsters is the possibility that this movement will ignite a new chapter in the revolution throughout the region and extend its sympathy to europe itself especially france because there is no stable country in the whole region there are mass protests demanding change everywhere between 2017 and 2018 morocco has seen strong protests in the rif and jrada not to mention many strikes general strikes and students protests in recent weeks it has experienced a movement of protests headed by teachers on temporary contracts along with unemployed youth tunisia is also witnessing the outbreak of mass demonstrations against the high price of goods and various forms of exploitation and oppression jordan had seen big protests in june 2018 against an increase in taxes which led to the overthrow of the government iraq has also been hit by strong protests in basra in july and october even iran has seen protesters take to the streets on several occasions over the past year sudan is wracked with major protests right now which the dictatorial regime of bashir has not yet succeeded in stopping despite deploying bullets arrests and other brutal methods of suppression the need for a revolutionary party the poverty marginalisation and national oppression experienced by the peoples of the region is the direct result of the capitalist regimes in the region the maghreb region is rich in wealth and under a democratically planned socialist economy could become a paradise on earth for the benefit of the peoples of the region as a whole not for a bunch of thieves as it is today but this requires the overthrow of capitalism the destruction of its dictatorial regimes and a severing of ties with imperialism in short it requires a socialist revolution and the seizure of power by the working class revolutionary youth and marxist activists must assume the task of building a revolutionary marxist party image fair use in algeria and all over the region the masses have repeatedly demonstrated their desire for change and their ability to achieve it there is no sacrifice that they have been unwilling to make during these last years to change their situation and with great heroism they have faced repression of all kinds but the problem is the absence of revolutionary leadership that can unite these struggles and give them a fighting programme the reformist leaders of trade unions and left parties are completely corrupt and bankrupt they have become traitors in the service of the regimes the only struggle they know is to participate in elections parliaments and dialogue they have abandoned any revolutionary perspective many of them have become a tool to pass austerity policies and attacks on the gains and rights of the working class and youth revolutionary youth and marxist activists must assume the task of building a revolutionary marxist party like the bolshevik party which succeeded in 1917 in leading the russian working class to power building a state of workers and poor peasant councils this task is indispensable and urgent and without which there is no possibility of victory despite all the masses great sacrifices just as the steam evaporates when there is no piston box to direct it nobody will do this for us we must make our own destiny in order to do so we have to trust our class the working class which is the only class that creates all the wealth in society and we must arm ourselves with marxist ideas which will enable us to build the necessary forces to lead the struggle to change society and eliminate cruelty injustice exploitation and slavery only in this way will we live to see the triumph of socialism in algeria in north africa and throughout the world

an increase of 39 compared to 34 5 million in the prior year comparative quarter and for the year ended 2018 was 161 7 million compared to 125 4 million in the prior year an increase of 29 adjusted ebitda margin for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 26 8 compared to 26 2 in the prior year quarter and for the year ended 2018 was 26 3 compared to 25 2 in the prior year improvements in adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin were driven by revenue growth higher hydrovac utilization and improved labour efficiency badger realized record revenues for the fourth quarter of 2018 of 178 6 million 35 higher compared to 132 1 million for the same period in 2017 record revenues were driven by revenue growth in the u s of 40 with revenue of us 105 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 while revenue in canada of 38 9 million was 8 higher than the prior year comparative quarter average hydrovac rates for the fourth quarter were consistent to modestly higher across both the u s and canadian markets compared to the same period in 2017 badger s investment in sales and marketing continues to contribute to the ongoing growth in revenue particularly within the u s operations where the opportunity for further market penetration in both new and existing markets exists as a result of hydrovac being an underutilized component of the excavation value chain in many parts of the u s revenue growth particularly in the u s operations was attributable to increased demand for hydrovac services from both new and existing customers due in part to the continued growth in the adoption of hydrovac technology combined with revenues related to emergency response work as a result of hurricane michael and the california wildfires fourth quarter revenue related to emergency response work was approximately 20 0 million the impact of which was partially offset by a fourth quarter bad debt provision of 5 3 million the majority of which relates to a chapter 11 bankruptcy filing by a large utility customer for work performed related to the california wildfires rpt for the fourth quarter was 37 837 or 19 higher compared to 31 921 for the same period in 2017 and for the year ended 2018 was 34 347 or 13 higher compared to 30 266 in the prior year badger successfully increased rpt for both the fourth quarter and year ended 2018 while at the same time adding a net 14 hydrovacs in the quarter and a net 112 hydrovacs for the year the improvements in rpt were driven by a combination of revenue growth including the impact of emergency response work and improved fleet utilization badger s operational scale and its importance in driving fleet utilization was evident in badger s fourth quarter revenues and rpt with both financial measures benefiting from badger s operating scale badger s extensive operating scale provided the ability to respond to significant customer demand related to emergency response activities as noted above badger had 1 221 hydrovacs in operation at december 31 2018 compared to 1 109 as at december 31 2017 badger continues to actively manage direct operating costs in particular direct labour resulting in an improvement in badger s gross profit margin to 31 5 in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 31 1 in the prior year comparative quarter direct operating costs as a percentage of revenue for the fourth quarter were 68 5 compared to 68 9 in the prior year quarter in addition to improved labour efficiency margins also benefited from modestly higher average pricing due to the ongoing implementation of strategic pricing initiatives the impacts of which more than offset higher bad debts badger continues to focus on ensuring services rates are reflective of both the total value proposition badger s services provide and local market conditions the improvement in gross profit margin is a testament to the focus of badger s operations team on managing direct operating costs and selling prices as initially announced in the second quarter of 2018 badger has initiated a process to upgrade and standardize its legacy information technology systems into a single enterprise resource planning erp system the common business platform during the fourth quarter activities related to the common business platform were primarily focused on business process redesign and the related configuration and integration into the erp platform the common business platform is currently on budget and on time net profit for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 23 5 million or 0 63 per share compared to 31 2 million or 0 84 per share in the prior year comparative quarter net profit for the year ended was 67 8 million or 1 38 per share compared to 65 9 million or 1 77 per share in the prior year net profit for fourth quarter of 2018 and the year ended 2018 were impacted by the same items as adjusted ebitda and the impact of tax adjustments related to updated u s tax legislation enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017 see badger s 2018 annual md a for additional details on badger s 2018 annual and fourth quarter financial results driving long term shareholder returns normal course issuer bid and dividend increase during the fourth quarter and for the fiscal year ended 2018 pursuant to badger s ncib badger purchased and cancelled 628 614 common shares at a weighted average price per share of 31 96 in addition for the period ended january 1 2019 through march 12 2019 badger purchased an additional 633 454 common shares at a weighted average price per share of 33 50 in addition to driving long term shareholder returns through the ncib program badger s board of directors has approved a 6 increase to the dividend effective with the march 2019 dividend payable in april of 2019 badger will increase its dividend to 0 0475 per common share per month or 0 57 per common share annualized from the current rate of 0 045 per common share per month or 0 54 per common share annualized badger continues to maintain a strong balance sheet as at december 31 2018 there were no amounts drawn on its syndicated revolving credit facility providing the flexibility to facilitate ongoing growth in the business badger s total debt less cash and cash equivalents was 54 0 million at december 31 2018 with a corresponding total debt less cash and cash equivalents to compliance ebitda ratio of 0 4x 2019 financial outlook based on existing and forecasted activity levels badger anticipates that its 2019 adjusted ebitda will be in the range of 170 to 190 million with a hydrovac build of between 190 to 220 units and retirements of 40 to 60 units which is consistent with the 2019 financial outlook provided in the third quarter of 2018 continued growth in badger s end use markets and geographic areas has resulted in an increase in revenue and improved fleet utilization as evidenced by improved financial results and a higher realized rpt in 2018 badger anticipates continued growth in revenues in 2019 with gross profit margin for 2019 to be similar to 2018 rpt for 2019 is anticipated to be modestly lower than in 2018 particularly in the u s operations as 22 5 million of emergency response work completed during the third and fourth quarter of 2018 resulted in an increase to badger s 2018 rpt emergency response work related to natural disasters is not possible to predict and may not recur in 2019 badger s 2019 financial outlook assumes that badger will continue to realize ongoing growth in the use of hydrovac for non destructive excavation as a result of continued customer adoption particularly in its u s markets badger expects to see improvements in revenue as a result of the scale of its extensive branch network combined with the ongoing benefits of sales and marketing related activities the overall macro economic environment in both the u s and canada is anticipated to be supportive of ongoing infrastructure and construction activity levels for 2019 oil and gas activity levels are anticipated to be consistent with 2018 levels within badger s u s operations but weaker in canada in 2019 compared to 2018 badger continues to see organic growth opportunities in the majority of its markets although the ability to capture these opportunities may be partially limited by the availability of trained operators as the market for labour particularly in certain oil and gas focused regions continues to be challenging badger s 2018 adjusted ebitda of 161 7 million was modestly higher than the 2018 financial outlook provided in the third quarter of 2018 of 150 to 160 million the improvement compared to the previously provided financial outlook was due to stronger than anticipated customer activity levels throughout the fourth quarter due in part to the impact of emergency response work related to hurricane michael and the california wildfires during 2018 badger placed 191 new hydrovacs into service while retiring 79 units both of which were consistent with the outlook previously provided by badger badger remains focused on generating profitable long term sustainable growth to drive total shareholder returns in that light during 2017 and 2018 substantial progress was made towards meeting the strategic milestones that were established in late 2016 significant progress has been made in meeting the objectives to i double the u s business from fiscal 2016 levels over a period of 3 to 5 years ii grow adjusted ebitda by a minimum of 15 per year iii target adjusted ebitda margins of 28 to 29 and iv drive fleet utilization and revenue per truck per month above 30 000 although the adjusted ebitda margin for 2018 of 26 3 was below the longer term objective of 28 to 29 it was a 110 basis point increase over 2017 badger remains focused on business improvement activities to drive further margin improvements over the next several years badger s record financial performance in 2018 is a testament to the strength of badger s unique business model conference call to discuss 2018

yesterday evening the streets of algeria erupted with joy after the announcement that the hated de facto dictator for life was withdrawing from the presidential election scheduled for april no fifth term for bouteflika was the rallying cry of the masses for weeks now it seems that they have achieved their goal president abdulaziz bouteflika has announced that he will not stand for a fifth term this withdrawal is a big victory for the masses in action over a regime that did not want to budge the latest estimate france24 11 march put the number of participants in the daily demonstrations at somewhere between 10 and 15 million at their height out of a population of 40 million this scope of these mobilisation has not been seen since the country achieved independence in 1962 the call for a general strike on social media was also gathering momentum since yesterday but this sent shockwaves through the ruling class several layers of which seemed to be abandoning bouteflika or at least hedging their bets by not supporting him outright besides the imams and judges declaring their newly discovered independence from the regime the head of the army in a cryptic message announced that the army shares the same goals as the people there can be no doubt a real political storm has broken out the ruling class is now trying to manoeuvre in order to regain the initiative they are afraid that should they continue their former intransigent position they would risk being overrun completely by the revolutionary wave thus they are trying to give concessions in order to buy time and peace but the exaltation of the masses is nevertheless mixed the decision not to run in the next presidential elections does not mean bouteflika has resigned quite the contrary it is a manoeuvre of his clan of generals and businessmen to remain in power the announcement yesterday evening included more measures the presidential elections have been postponed sine die no new timetable has been set a national conference of whom will be convened to establish a new constitution that will be submitted to a referendum at the end of the year then and only then will there be new presidential elections the daily demonstrations were 10 15 million strong image eric blanc but again no precise dates have been set until then bouteflika will preside over a technocratic government this means in reality an extended fourth term for the president already hashtags are circulating on the algerian social media demanding no extended fourth term leave means leave has also quickly become a popular slogan ali dilem an algerian cartoonist drew a caricature of mr bouteflika announcing he would not pursue a fifth term instead i ll do a fourth term of ten years the president says other measures confirm the stubborn desire of the ruling clique to stay in power the government has been reorganised with the aim of strengthening the clan around the president they know they have to try to deceive in order to stay in power intimidation and repression have not worked so they are trying to win time instead but weeks of mobilisation in defiance of the regime has increased the consciousness of the masses they have learned more in those weeks than in years of passivity the victory of yesterday will embolden them they will want more especially the youth the majority of the algerians are younger than 30 years want the whole mafia of bureaucrats generals and businessmen out of power they must all leave commented young demonstrators yesterday already a new day of mobilisation is announced for this friday 15 march the battle of algiers has just begun the below article was first published in arabic on 6 march before the latest events since 22 february there have been mass demonstrations throughout algeria these are the largest protests since the al aroush movement in june 2000 the marches began when president abdelaziz bouteflika s office announced his intention to run for a fifth term this proved to be the straw that broke the camel s back in terms of the accumulated anger of the algerian youth although this movement seemed to appear out of nowhere it has not been an isolated event in fact 2018 has seen a rise in popular struggles the most prominent of which have been strikes by doctors education sector workers and the strong popular uprisings in bashar and ouargla in southern algeria a turning point these protests in their depth size and combativeness mark a new phase in the history of class struggle in algeria and the region as a whole the algerian regime was able to weather the storm of the revolutions that spread through north africa and the middle east since 2011 this was achieved by a combination of material concessions for some layers and by threatening a return to the years of civil war that algeria experienced during the 1990s these criminals in the regime have long blackmailed the algerian people by dredging up the bloody decade during which the army and the islamists collaborated to wreak havoc throughout the country and to kill at least 200 000 people they still repeat the same song against the recent protests the price of restoring algeria s security and stability was huge and it is important to maintain this precious achievement said deputy defense minister and army chief of staff lieutenant general ghaid saleh in a speech after the protests he added proper objective thinking must bear consideration of the security accomplished after the bloody years experienced by algeria although the price to restore algeria s security and stability was great prime minister ahmed ouyahia also did not forget to remind everyone who would listen of this period he referred to it several times especially in his speech in parliament he also used the threat of syria s experiences in recent years what he really means is either surrender and submit to us or we will unleash the forces of hell upon you but the demonstrators responded to him in the streets by saying ouyahia algeria is not syria the decision not to run in the next presidential elections does not mean bouteflika has resigned it is a manoeuvre of his clan of generals and businessmen to remain in power image magharebia what we see today in the streets of algeria is evidence that it is now the ruling class who are afraid while the algerian people are raising their heads again and regaining their great revolutionary traditions faced with the heroism of the masses which were not stopped by tear gas batons and arrests the ruling gang was forced to make concessions quickly indicating the magnitude of the terror they feel immediately after the outbreak of protests the official news agency announced that bouteflika had removed his campaign manager and former prime minister abdelmalek sallal replacing him with the current transport minister abdelghani zaalan but this only led to further protests because it was seen as nothing but a manoeuvre to maintain the rule of the clique around bouteflika bouteflika himself has disappeared from public life after a stroke he suffered in 2013 it is believed that he is nothing but a puppet a corpse in the real and political sense of the word that is controlled by a gang of cronies around him on sunday the ruling clique issued another statement on behalf of this corpse it declared bouteflika s intention to not complete his presidential term if he wins on 18 april and to organise early presidential elections in which he will not be a candidate and because words are cheap the authors of that statement promised everything under the sun they said in the name of the president i am determined if the algerian people elect me again to assume the historical responsibility to respond to your fundamental demands that is regime change he also pledged to prepare a new constitution that enshrines the birth of a new republic and a new algerian regime as well as the establishment of urgent public policies that will allow the equitable redistribution of national wealth the elimination of all marginalisation and social exclusion etc in this way the ruling clique wants to divide the movement so that it can regain the initiative but if these gangsters really imagine the algerian people will believe these promises and be fooled by their manoeuvre they have lost all contact with reality this was proved by the algerian people who treated the statement with the contempt it deserved and stepped up their protests accident and necessity the immediate reason behind this popular uprising is the widespread rejection of the nomination of bouteflika as a presidential candidate for a fifth time but this was merely an accident that expressed a deeper necessity a great deal of anger and indignation has accumulated over many years of cuts looting and repression waiting under the surface for an opportunity to express itself this last provocation was the spark that lit the powder keg algeria is a rich country the largest in africa 2 381 741 square kilometres four times the size of france and its most important source of wealth is its youth who represent the majority of the population under 25s represent 46 percent of the population the unemployment rate has grown from 10 5 percent in 2016 to 11 1 percent in 2018 it has particularly hit young people and women reaching 26 4 percent among young people aged 16 to 24 and 20 percent among women algeria is also the world s fifth largest natural gas producer and 13th in oil production these wellsprings of wealth supplied the state budget during the period between 1999 and 2014 i e the reign of bouteflika with 750 billion dollars this kind of money could permanently eliminate poverty and unemployment in the country and rebuild algeria several times over at all levels given an economic and political system based on the democratic planning of the economy and popular control over wealth however despite this enormous wealth algeria is a country with deep problems the president s visit to switzerland for medical checks is one of a thousand indications of this it demonstrates that after 25 years of rule and 57 years of independence there is still not a single hospital that he trusts to provide him with treatment the promises made in the ruling clique s latest statement about its intention to develop urgent public policies that would ensure the equitable redistribution of national wealth and eliminate all social marginalisation and exclusion are further proof of their own political bankruptcy the bankruptcy of the capitalist class and the ruling gang is clearly exposed in their parasitic dependence on oil and natural gas revenues instead of investment in education infrastructure industry the environment or any other societal good this has made the country vulnerable to fluctuations in energy prices thus after energy prices fell in the international market from 2014 and onwards oil revenues fell by 70 percent according to official figures foreign currency reserves also fell to 93 billion from 114 billion in 2016 it is expected to drop to 76 billion in 2020 equivalent to 17 months of imports the country s debt increased from 20 4 percent as a proportion of gdp in 2016 to 32 9 percent in 2018 and for the first time in quarter of a century the country recorded a trade deficit 13 7 billion in the wake of these economic setbacks the government has launched brutal austerity policies forcing the workers and poor to shoulder the burden of the crisis caused by the policies of the ruling class since independence they have recently announced that the algerian people will have to endure difficult times as a solution to the mounting economic problems they have resorted to mass layoffs they also intended to abandon subsidies for many basic goods such as oil and to reduce the value of the dinar to increasingly make the poor pay for the crisis since 2014 the dinar has lost 48 percent of its value compared to the dollar the inflation rate reached 7 5 percent in 2018 along with this economic bankruptcy of the ruling class we also witness their political bankruptcy after 20 years of bouteflika s rule and more than five decades of independence there is no democratic freedom in algeria something even those who wrote bouteflika s statement had to admit for example algeria is classified by the united nations as a non free country in terms of political freedoms and in 2017 it ranked 134 out of 180 countries concerning press freedom the regime is afraid the regime believed that things were under control and that order was settled which was reflected in the arrogance with which they dealt with popular demands and all forms of opposition then came this movement which they did not expect and whose strength they underestimated it turned everything upside down the dilemma of the ruling gangsters is that they do not have much room to manoeuvre unlike in the past they no longer have billions of dollars on hand to make financial concessions to the masses especially given the significant decline in oil and gas prices and the amount of waste and corruption rampant in the state their song about the historical legitimacy the legitimacy of the algerian revolution and the struggle against colonialism no longer convinces anyone everyone knows that they are just a gang that confiscated the rights of the algerian people looted the country and turned it into a farm of the imperialist companies french americans and others i e the same crimes that the masses wanted to break with through the revolution the criminal blackmail they are waging against the people by submission to security by raising the spectre of the red years every time they face a mass movement no longer works especially on young people for whom the only terrorism they have known in their lives is the state terrorism it is possible that the ruling clique cornered by these protests may resort to terrorist attacks here and there or at least to allow them to take place in order to derail the revolutionary movement but it is highly unlikely that they would risk returning to the years of civil war after they burned their fingers and their interests were severely damaged the algerian working class is one of the strongest working classes in the region and on the continent as a whole it has a long history of struggle and great revolutionary traditions image fair use they are now facing a real impasse their retreats before popular demands will reveal their impotence increase the confidence of the masses and embolden their demands but the regime s intransigence threatens to increase public anger and should the protests draw in new layers and affect more regions this will deepen the splits at the top in war as in chess there comes a stage where a move in either direction retreat or attack could still lead to defeat and the ruling gang in algeria has reached this situation but they are not the only ones who are afraid of the great rise of the algerian people all the regimes of the region feel the heat under their backsides the algerian working class is one of the strongest working classes in the region and on the continent as a whole it has a long history of struggle and great revolutionary traditions thus its rise and triumph will inspire all the peoples of the region and the whole continent indeed the masses on the streets of sudan since february started to raise slogans of solidarity with the movement in algeria and the leader of the rif movement in morocco nasser zafzafi sent a message to the algerian youth from his cell expressing his solidarity with them the imperialists especially the french are following these events with concern this is normal because what is happening in algeria certainly affects france the algerian regime plays the role of france s obedient dog in the region amidst the so called war on terrorism and in restricting migration they also have significant interests in algeria in terms of investments and trade the latter of which amounts to 5 billion a year as algeria is one of the largest importers of french wheat and an important provider of energy providing 10 percent of france s requirement of gas etc the most important factor is the presence of a large algerian working class in france which has a great revolutionary tradition and is involved in the mass struggles that recently broke out in france they are also following with interest and sympathy events in their country of origin and are very angry at the complicity between the french ruling class and the ruling gang in algeria what frightens the french ruling class and algerian gangsters is the possibility that this movement will ignite a new chapter in the revolution throughout the region and extend its sympathy to europe itself especially france because there is no stable country in the whole region there are mass protests demanding change everywhere between 2017 and 2018 morocco has seen strong protests in the rif and jrada not to mention many strikes general strikes and students protests in recent weeks it has experienced a movement of protests headed by teachers on temporary contracts along with unemployed youth tunisia is also witnessing the outbreak of mass demonstrations against the high price of goods and various forms of exploitation and oppression jordan had seen big protests in june 2018 against an increase in taxes which led to the overthrow of the government iraq has also been hit by strong protests in basra in july and october even iran has seen protesters take to the streets on several occasions over the past year sudan is wracked with major protests right now which the dictatorial regime of bashir has not yet succeeded in stopping despite deploying bullets arrests and other brutal methods of suppression the need for a revolutionary party the poverty marginalisation and national oppression experienced by the peoples of the region is the direct result of the capitalist regimes in the region the maghreb region is rich in wealth and under a democratically planned socialist economy could become a paradise on earth for the benefit of the peoples of the region as a whole not for a bunch of thieves as it is today but this requires the overthrow of capitalism the destruction of its dictatorial regimes and a severing of ties with imperialism in short it requires a socialist revolution and the seizure of power by the working class revolutionary youth and marxist activists must assume the task of building a revolutionary marxist party image fair use in algeria and all over the region the masses have repeatedly demonstrated their desire for change and their ability to achieve it there is no sacrifice that they have been unwilling to make during these last years to change their situation and with great heroism they have faced repression of all kinds but the problem is the absence of revolutionary leadership that can unite these struggles and give them a fighting programme the reformist leaders of trade unions and left parties are completely corrupt and bankrupt they have become traitors in the service of the regimes the only struggle they know is to participate in elections parliaments and dialogue they have abandoned any revolutionary perspective many of them have become a tool to pass austerity policies and attacks on the gains and rights of the working class and youth revolutionary youth and marxist activists must assume the task of building a revolutionary marxist party like the bolshevik party which succeeded in 1917 in leading the russian working class to power building a state of workers and poor peasant councils this task is indispensable and urgent and without which there is no possibility of victory despite all the masses great sacrifices just as the steam evaporates when there is no piston box to direct it nobody will do this for us we must make our own destiny in order to do so we have to trust our class the working class which is the only class that creates all the wealth in society and we must arm ourselves with marxist ideas which will enable us to build the necessary forces to lead the struggle to change society and eliminate cruelty injustice exploitation and slavery only in this way will we live to see the triumph of socialism in algeria in north africa and throughout the world

beijing march 12 2019 prnewswire puhui wealth investment management co ltd nasdaq phcf puhui or the company a third party wealth management service provider with a focus on wealth management services for high net worth hnw individuals and corporate clients announced today that following its december 2018 initial public offering ipo and nasdaq listing mr zhe ji the chairman and ceo of the company has released a letter to shareholders highlighting its corporate strategy for 2019 and beyond the letter is included in its entirety below to our valued shareholders the last few months have been a milestone period for puhui and its shareholders in december 2018 we were extremely pleased to list in the united states on the nasdaq capital market we believe that our listing helps further strengthen the company s image in china with our high net worth clientele while also providing investors with a unique opportunity to invest in china s growing wealth management market we expect to continue to grow considerably by offering a unique value proposition to investors in china seeking a diversified independent wealth manager with access to a broad portfolio of financial products the listing of our shares was another step in a long journey and i wanted to outline the company s background current status differentiating factors and strategy for growth in the years ahead background on puhui changing the model to focus on china s fast growing wealth management business i began my career in banking 17 years ago initially puhui was founded as an investment advisory firm which focused on internet financial services and had successfully marketed products to retail investors in china starting with low transaction amounts under 10 000 this allowed the company to build a broad base of loyal clients during a time when other competitors were making exorbitant promises with the changing regulation in china s financial services industry and the increasing demand from the more profitable high net worth hnw sector starting in 2016 our management team decided to refocus our business to market financial products developed by qualified financial institutions to high net worth individuals and corporate clients the china wealth management opportunity in 2016 we reorganized our operations after reviewing the opportunity that existed in the growth of the nascent wealth management industry in china according to a report by beijing heading century consulting co ltd commissioned by the company by the end of 2016 the total amount of private investable assets in china reached rmb165 trillion approximately us 24 8 trillion and have been growing the macro factors certainly worked in favor of growth in this market which included a rising middle class higher median household income and a very low investment percentage when compared to the rest of the world the total amount of private investable assets is expected to continue to provide significant development potential for wealth management companies in china to put this growth in context according to willis towers watson over the past five years the united states was the 5th fastest growing country in private wealth management with a 7 5 increase china leads the growth rate globally at 43 with the economic development and increasing per capita disposable income the populations of wealthy and high net worth individuals are expected to continue to increase accordingly in the near future the puhui advantage we believed that a boutique nimble independent entity like puhui could simultaneously deliver better risk adjusted returns for investors in managing their wealth while also maintaining sufficient diversity across all of our investments the majority of larger banks in china specialize in selling a limited number of products to their customers which are typically sponsored by the bank puhui is able to partner with multiple major financial institutions and can tailor a specific solution for its customers for example the investment needs for a 25 year old with no family are materially different than a 45 year old with a teenager we feel that by building a base of diverse products to offer from differing qualified financial institutions we could provide better returns with managed risk greater selection and ultimately a more satisfied customer at the same time larger institutions want to work with puhui because we provide access to sell their products to new customers we see this as a win win for all parties we began to leverage our existing relationships and began to open low cost branches in late 2016 offering limited financial products to customers during this transition as we grew our total number of hnw clients we expanded to products such as private equity funds products the underlying assets of which are portfolios of equity investment in private companies securities investment fund products the underlying assets of which are publicly traded stocks private placement bonds consisting primarily of collateralized fixed income products providing investors with fixed rate returns and other products including trust plans and asset management plans these were from such well regarded institutions as cicc everbright zte fund management saif partners and yingke pe we selected these partners carefully as we understand that it is a balance offering a diverse enough offering to satisfy investors while also generating enough business within these institutions to achieve a sustainable margin as a company to grow the revenue model may vary by investments we secure the investments for our clients and receive a commission with carried interest in some cases with our relationships and economic scale we have had the opportunity to invest in such well regarded companies as zhejiang ant small and micro financial services group co ltd beijing electric vehicle co ltd shanghai united imaging healthcare co ltd shenzhen royole technologies co ltd ucar inc and beijing sensetime science tech ltd we believe that our ability to access a wide range of investments and strategies is a differentiator for the company our wealth management strategies going forward over the course of fiscal 2016 2018 we grew the amount of transactions with our clientele significantly from 39 customers transacting with the company as of june 30 2016 to 622 as of june 30 2018 throughout multiple cities in eastern china we operated 5 sales offices in 3 major cities and now offer 20 financial products from 10 financial institutions as of today these financial products consist of diversified portfolio investment funds investments in private debt and venture funds that allow puhui and its investors to invest in both early stage companies in china and abroad along with a diversified array of equity and private debt offerings our investments in these funds are a distinct differentiator from our peers we feel that puhui offered a distinct advantage over our peers in that we offer these financial products from top investment and fund companies in china while maintaining a low overall operating cost we focus intensely on our retention levels which consist of individuals who have repeat investments with our company this level has remained over 85 since inception we are very proud of this fact as our investors would not remain if the investments tailored specifically for them were not working as expected we also anticipated that puhui would have access to an increasing number of investment opportunities on behalf of our clients due to the size and scale of the transactions we were making with these financial institutions and our own proprietary evaluations as a result starting in june 2017 we launched our asset management business acting as manager or general partner of funds in which our clients invested our subsidiaries qingdao puhui and shanghai pucai serve as the manager of their respective funds as of june 30 2018 we served as manager or general partner of four funds with an aggregate of over rmb155 4 million approximately us 23 5 million under management we believe that opportunities exist between our wealth management and asset management businesses to create value for shareholders in january 2019 we were very pleased to enter into a strategic cooperation agreement with yingke innovation asset management co ltd yingke pe to jointly establish an equity investment fund yingke pe was ranked 38th of all venture capital firms in china for 2018 the ipo in the united states the rationale and opportunity our growth is largely dependent on attracting new individuals to trust their hard earned investment dollars with our company this allows puhui to have greater economies of scale in its operations while also improving the financial leverage with the institutions that offer our diversified products we felt that our entire management team advisors and sales staff had done a tremendous job transitioning our relationships created as we grew the original business into a stable and well respected brand in china for wealth management however to continue to grow on a faster pace we needed additional capital and brand recognition and a global platform the international recognition would help drive our brand image across china and lead us on the goal of ultimately being a global wealth advisor in addition the capital raised from our ipo could be deployed in opening new sales offices and driving client and asset management growth we were very delighted to be listed on nasdaq as of december 2018 for global investors we understand that one of the biggest challenges as a u s listed company based in china is transparency we feel that this is an area where puhui can stand out as a financial advisor we are required to be professional honest and maintain compliance with regulations and are required to undergo thorough due diligence and oversight both internally and through government regulation investors can verify our registration via the asset management association of china government licensing and certification institution at the specific reference link for puhui s pe fund is the challenge of our business model transition to focus on hnw individuals is behind us and now we are starting to see a considerable increase in both clients and total assets under management what investors should look for in the coming months as a general note puhui operates on a june 30th fiscal year we are required to report our financial results for the first half ended december 31 2018 by the end of june our goal is to begin reporting our financials on a quarterly basis similar to all u s listed public companies operationally our goal is to provide metrics that investors can easily digest and understand the impact to the company we believe that periodic updates should be viewed as examples that the company is moving in the right direction we believe that the following announcements and metrics are helpful to consider when evaluating puhui the signing of additional partnerships with quality financial institutions we believe that investors should examine the partnerships that we sign and why we will be selective in choosing partners in according to brand a history of success rankings among top institutions management and investment performance this is not a unilateral number where if puhui goes up by 5 partners that is a great thing its important to have the right mix of both diversified products while balancing the economies within each institution the number of high net worth clients and or amount invested the opening of new locations hiring of advisors and their strategic value for brand building and strategic planning our asset management performance and how it is complementary to our wealth management operations in the ability to increase back end income conclusion a unique opportunity in cy 2019 and beyond in the coming months our goal is to communicate these metrics and properly let all investors know of the opportunity that exists in what we are building we have worked diligently to complete our ipo and look forward to delivering on the promises that our investors expect of us it has been a whirlwind period for our management team and all puhui employees we are excited for the future and believe we are uniquely positioned to achieve substantive and sustainable growth for the foreseeable future i look forward to speaking with many of you and invite you to visit us at our office in beijing mr zhe ji chairman

the great depression has led policymakers commentators and academics to question the ability of monetary policy to affect real activity as is well known in standard new keynesian models galí 2015 policy non neutrality is stronger the higher the degree of rigidity the degree of wage rigidity is also different across countries or regions and sectors belonging to the same country leading to asymmetric effects of monetary policy and possible regional misallocation the latter is also crucial for understanding spatial inequality quantifying the impact of monetary policy a long standing question in economics requires an accurate measurement of nominal rigidities this is typically a challenging task and requires the use of detailed often confidential micro data while much progress has been made in measuring the effects of nominal rigidities in output prices gorodnichenko and weber 2015 we have less evidence on the role of flexibility in the wage adjustment process however measuring such rigidities with micro data is important for at least two reasons first given that wage rigidity is likely to vary between firms or sectors an exact assessment of those rigidities allows researchers to quantify the heterogenous effects of monetary policy second relatively inflexible wage bargaining regulations or practices may prevent firms from reacting to aggregate shocks in a timely manner such as in monetary policy decisions quantifying these costs is crucial for understanding the extent of spatial and sectorial misallocation and for the design of appropriate labour market policies monetary policy in the presence of collective agreements in our recent work faia and pezone 2018 we focus on italy a single fairly integrated labour market we do so for two reasons first wage setting is still fairly centralised and firm level bargaining plays a relatively minor role similarly to other countries in western europe ichino et al 2019 hence our results may serve as a useful benchmark second we can make use of a unique employee employer dataset comprising the universe of workers employed in the private sector which we access through the project visitinps scholars program at the italian institute of social security we combine this dataset with intraday data on stock returns as well as hand collected information on renewals of collective agreements which typically last two or three years we then test using high frequency identification whether wage rigidity induced by collective bargaining amplifies the effects of monetary policy the intuition we exploit is straightforward and relies on the fact that a firm may be hit by a shock at different stages of the life of its workers collective agreement if the monetary policy shock occurs when the agreement is close to the renewal any change in firm profitability due to a macroeconomic shock will be promptly accounted for in the new contract on the other hand if there is a long time left before the renewal workers and managers will be stuck with the wage previously agreed upon despite the fact that firm profitability might have drastically changed hence in this case the impact of a change in the central bank s policy will have stronger effects on firm valuations an example clarifies our strategy on september 4 2014 mario draghi unexpectedly announced a 10 basis points cut to the deposit facility rate one of the main ecb target rates the collective agreement in force for the telecommunication industry in italy was set to expire at the end of the same year workers employed by large glass producers instead had their agreement in force until august 31 2015 suppose the shock was effective in boosting demand and hence firm output an increase in revenues should generally translate into higher workers wages however this pass through was set to occur much later for workers employed by glass producers hence the employers in this sector should have enjoyed a larger boost in profits than those in the telecommunication industry this differential response should be reflected in stock market valuations and in employment levels based on a simple theoretical framework inspired by work by fischer 1977 and taylor 1979 we predict that the distance to contract renewal will amplify the effects of monetary policy on the volatility of stock returns and employment the costs of wage rigidity in our empirical design we exploit high frequency identification of monetary policy shocks because market valuations will react only to new information we need to extract the unexpected component of monetary policy decisions following previous work we measure monetary policy shocks via changes in swap rates on the euro overnight index average eonia shortly after and before the time an ecb meeting takes place gürkaynak et al 2005 barakchian and crowe 2013 corsetti et al 2018 there is not a one to one correspondence between a firm s sector and the relevant collective agreement however thanks to the detailed information available in the visitinps data we aggregate at the firm month level hand collected information on the time that individual workers have left prior to their contract renewal to construct a proper proxy for wage stickiness using a large sample of listed italian firms between 2005 and 2016 we find results consistent with our hypothesis more specifically we find that the volatility of stock market returns reacts more to monetary policy announcements when the average time left before the renewal of the employees collective agreement is large these effects are quantitatively important the sensitivity of volatility increases by about half for firms that have wage stickiness one standard deviation above the mean in further tests we find that this amplification channel is stronger for firms that experience low profitability and at times of low economic growth we obtain similar results when we focus on changes in employment levels measured at quarterly frequencies importantly workers with short term contracts who tend to be younger and to have lower bargaining power appear to be those more exposed to the amplification induced by rigid contracts these effects are consistent with the predictions of a rigorous general equilibrium model we develop to interpret the results conclusion overall our findings show that the response to monetary policy shocks is heterogeneous and depends on the degree of nominal rigidities as well as on firms characteristics suggesting that monetary policy can have important distributional consequences while we focus on the heterogeneous response of firms to monetary policy shocks our basic empirical strategy and our laboratory economy can be adapted to study the response to other common events such as trade shocks our results also support the hypothesis that rigidly centralised wage bargaining agreements can prevent at least in part firms from absorbing aggregate shocks hence the heterogeneity in labour market practices and regulations in europe di mauro and ronchi 2017 is likely to generate different responses to monetary policy across economies of the euro area

by veneranda langa reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz governor john mangudya yesterday told parliament that the real time gross settlement rtgs dollar will likely be devalued further by the time the tobacco auction floors open next week by veneranda langa reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz governor john mangudya yesterday told parliament that the real time gross settlement rtgs dollar will likely be devalued further by the time the tobacco auction floors open next week addressing the public accounts committee pac and the parliamentary portfolio committee on finance mangudya said the economic environment was not conducive for the huge salary increments being demanded by workers which he said would destroy companies and push the country into recession pac chairperson tendai biti asked him to explain if the economy could take salary increases given the devaluation of the rtgs dollar to the united states dollar when you put in the 2 transaction tax you were not accounting for inevitable wage increases that are coming because unions are now demanding a wage increase of 3 000 at what rate will the us dollar finally settle in the market because the 2 5 is not selling and last week you even gave gold producers a rate of 3 5 biti said public sector workers have been demanding a minimum salary of 3 000 from around 400 after government abandoned its 1 1 peg of the local currency and the us last month the introduction of a 2 tax in october last year and the separation of local accounts and the us accounts which led to sharp price hikes of goods including fuel bread and medicines have also made matters worse for workers but mangudya said such high wage increments would push the country into recession i see shops now trying to promote their products and in my monetary policy statement mps i stated that i was more worried about going into recession and when that happens it will be very difficult to get out of it and an example is that you were not seeing mazoe orange crush but nowadays you see it mangudya said i do not see the economy having capacity to carry huge wage increases we need a balance i am not against salary increases but we need to consider the quantum where we need to be reasonable because at the end of the day we might end up in a recession where we are not going to be able to get out he said the rbz chief said currently wage inflation was dangerous for the country adding that his major concern was that the demand for goods and services had gone down because of that reason there is no capacity for this economy to provide higher salaries there is no capacity for companies or firms to be able to increase their prices right now there is resistance in terms of purchases i now hear that there will be promotions for cement for example he said the governor said it will be easier to come up with the right levels of wage increments when prices stabilise we think that inflation should be the one used to determine wages and therefore it means that going forward we need to look at the right levels of inflation we need to attack that animal called inflation so that at the end of the day when people talk about wage increases they are linked to inflation he said adding that in october the inflation base was at 20 but that the figures will be lower by 15 to 10 by year end mangudya also denied manipulating the exchange rate which he said was expected to change when the tobacco selling season starts on march 20 tobacco is zimbabwe s second largest foreign currency earner after mining we believe that before or on that date the rate will have reached its equilibrium we don t believe it will still be 2 5 to the us mangudya said analysts think the central bank would move the rate to around 3 5 to the us after the governor recently pegged a similar rate for miners which would still be lower than the parallel market rate of 3 8 mangudya was also grilled over the loss of value of pensions shurugwi south mp edmond mkaratigwa zanu pf asked on preservation of value in relation to pensioners i feel that you have preserved pension and insurance houses at the expense of pensioners because when we dollarised in 2009 up to february 2019 insurance companies were converting funds into assets on a one to one basis but now bank balances are in rtgs divided by 2 5 and we are losing at least more than 60 of value whereas insurance companies if they bought bricks for investment in buildings they preserved that 1 1 value mangudya denied that the exchange rate of 2 5 was responsible for eroding value insisting that pensions were being eroded by inflation inflation in zimbabwe has been going up because of the pass through effects of the exchange rates by opening up the economy we do believe that the rate of exchange will remain in bands that are acceptable which means that we can now tame inflation all inflation is caused by increased money supply we will preserve value for pensioners and all zimbabweans by ensuring that inflation does not go through the roof he said the governor said the best way of managing inflation was to provide insurance companies and pensioners with inflation linked products inflation is the one that erodes value and it means that we should deal with inflation pension funds need to preserve value for money by having inflation linked products and increase the money they pay to pensioners on a monthly basis mangudya said but mps felt that pensioners were robbed and that mangudya must come up with concrete plans to preserve value of pensions mangudya noted that failure to preserve foreign currency was due to zimbabwe not producing to earn forex all i am saying is that we need to understand the macro economic context and what we did with the mps is that we started at 2 5 rate and we need to reduce inflation the 1 1 value was being consumed by high inflation and now we are trying to ensure the economy stabilises the willing buyer willing seller policy will continue to be there and we are saying we are not breathing more money into the virtual currency as we go to september and october inflation will go down and by the end of the year it will be lower by 15 to 18 mangudya said on the exchange rate he said very soon the country will come to equilibrium as inflation stabilised
by lucia mutikani washington reuters u s retail sales rose modestly in january after a december drop that was even larger than originally estimated but the recovery was not seen strong enough to alter the course of a u s economy that was losing momentum in early 2019 the report from the commerce department on monday was welcome news for the economy after a raft of weak december data as well as a sharp moderation in the pace of job growth in february still january s increase in retail sales recouped only a fraction of december s plunge leaving expectations for a slowdown in consumer spending in the first quarter intact sales managed only a tepid reversal in january from december s deep freeze said douglas porter chief economist at bmo capital markets in toronto while we expect some further comeback in the next couple months the big story is that the economy s big engine is cooling retail sales rose 0 2 percent as increased purchases of building materials and more discretionary spending offset the biggest decline in motor vehicle sales in five years data for december was revised to show sales tumbling 1 6 percent instead of decreasing 1 2 percent as previously reported the drop in december was the biggest since september 2009 when the economy was emerging from recession economists polled by reuters had forecast retail sales to be unchanged in january sales in january increased 2 3 percent from a year ago the january retail sales report was delayed by a 35 day partial shutdown of the federal government that ended on jan 25 february s retail sales report which was scheduled for publication on thursday will be released on april 1 excluding automobiles gasoline building materials and food services retail sales rebounded 1 1 percent in january after a downwardly revised 2 3 percent plunge in december the largest drop since 2000 these so called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product they were previously reported to have decreased 1 7 percent in december consumer spending accounts for more than two thirds of u s economic activity coming on the heels of a deterioration in the trade deficit in december and weak construction spending the downward revision to the core retail sales suggested gross domestic product growth slowed more than the government initially estimated in the fourth quarter the government reported last month that the economy grew at a 2 6 percent annualized rate in the october december quarter after expanding at a brisk 3 4 percent in the third quarter economists now expect gdp growth will be lowered to a 2 1 percent pace when the government publishes its revision later this month fading fiscal stimulus the weaker december core retail sales also set consumer spending on a weaker growth path in the first three months of the year leading the atlanta federal reserve to cut its january march quarter gdp growth forecast by three tenths of percentage point to a 0 2 percent rate goldman sachs lowered its first quarter growth estimate by four tenths of a percentage point to a 0 5 percent rate consumer spending which increased at a 2 8 percent rate in the fourth quarter is seen rising modestly in the first three months of the year as the stimulus from a 1 5 trillion tax cut package fades in addition 2018 tax refunds have on average been smaller than in the previous years but spending remains supported by strong wage growth and higher consumer confidence the government reported on friday annual wage growth increased 3 4 percent in february the biggest gain since april 2009 from 3 1 percent in january slowing economic growth supports the federal reserve s patient approach toward further interest rate hikes this year fed chairman jerome powell reiterated the u s central bank s stance on sunday in a wide ranging interview with cbs s 60 minutes news show powell said the fed did not feel any hurry to change the level of interest rates again weak first quarter gdp will be another factor that keeps the fed patient at the march meeting and beyond said andrew hollenhorst an economist at citigroup in new york the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies while u s treasury prices fell stocks on wall street rose after five straight sessions of declines but a sharp drop in boeing co shares after a second deadly crash of one of its planes in just five months capped gains on the blue chip dow in january online and mail order retail sales increased 2 6 percent the biggest gain since december 2017 sales at building material stores increased 3 3 percent the most since september 2017 but receipts at auto dealerships tumbled 2 4 percent in january the largest drop since january 2014 after gaining 0 3 percent in the prior month receipts at service stations fell 2 0 percent reflecting cheaper gasoline prices there were also declines in sales at clothing and furniture stores as well as electronics and appliance shops discretionary spending rose in january with sales at restaurants and bars advancing 0 7 percent and purchases at hobby musical instrument and book stores jumping 4 8 percent the largest increase since january 2013 sales at food and beverage stores gained by the most since april 2016 reporting by lucia mutikani editing by andrea ricci

rubber solutions partially offset by decreased gross profit in engineered products gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 14 2 from 15 4 primarily as a result of higher input costs particularly with respect to rubber maintenance labour and training and in the case of engineered products lower net sales combined with increased steel costs as a result of the tariffs introduced by the united states compared to 2017 consolidated net income declined by 32 4 in 2018 to 8 536 due to higher operating expenses and higher income tax rates consolidated ebitda for 2018 decreased by 7 2

profit in both businesses of the engineered products segment consolidated net income decreased to 1 331 as a result of lower gross profit and higher income taxes relative to the comparable period in 2017 which included a 956 benefit resulting from the tax cuts and jobs act introduced at the end of 2017 segment results at rubber solutions net sales increased by 13 9 to 35 584 compared to the same

the defense business was partly offset by a 402 increase in the automotive business the decrease in the defense business was largely in the filter product line as a result of increased shipments in the second half of 2017 following the fulfillment of a previously delayed contract due to customer specific changes as well as lower glove and shelter sales in the automotive business increased net sales resulting from higher demand in the bushings grommets and induction bonding product lines were partly offset by softness in the dampers product lines outlook the company is starting to see accelerated improvements from the ramp up of the airboss operating system particularly in rubber solutions management will continue to focus on scaling and increasing the pace of these improvements across the business and anticipates this will offset continued volatility with respect to raw material pricing and other input costs while there has been some relief uncertainty in global trading relationships resulting from the current tariff environment and the corresponding impact on some of our customers confidence in their future demand continues particularly in the automotive business within engineered products despite these headwinds the current pipeline remains solid and broad based across our business segments and among the sectors we serve the recently announced awards at airboss defense the defense products line of the engineered products segment are particularly encouraging in the rubber solutions segment operational improvement initiatives have started to result in meaningful gains and we are entering 2019 with a robust pipeline of diversified business management expects that the combination of this pipeline and the traction from operational improvements will continue to deliver strong results in 2019 the company s strategic focus remains on maintaining its leadership position as a rubber based solutions provider to its broad customer base while also continuing to increase and expand the breadth of its portfolio of higher margin compounds in support of this the company recently announced expansion plans to add a second mixing line in its scotland neck nc facility as well as a dedicated white and colour mixing line and a significant enhancement of its r d and laboratory capabilities in its flagship kitchener on facility once fully operational these investments in mixing assets are expected to increase operational efficiencies and profitability particularly in our white and colour portfolio in the engineered products automotive business the implementation of the operational and commercial initiatives introduced in 2018 in conjunction with aggressive continuous improvement initiatives are anticipated to lead to improved results as 2019 progresses management is confident that the automotive business strong leadership in sales and business development engineering and operations will enable it to increasingly win shares of new

finance and economic development minister professor mthuli ncube says the country s financial situation is improving with the newly introduced rtgs dollar set to gain more value on the back of on going fiscal reforms and control of money supply into the market in an interview with united states national public radio npr during his recent trip to washington dc prof ncube said government s transformative reform drive was slowly pulling the economy back to stability the situation is improving but improving slowly but it will improve faster as we go along he said i m hopeful we will see this through zimbabwe will be normal again we ll turn it around asked about the public confidence factor on the new rtgs and the need to tame inflation which had spiralled into double digits he said prudent macro economic management and capacity exhibited by president mnangagwa s dispensation would yield the desired confidence and focus which was absent in the past that has changed since four months ago since we came in we are running a budget surplus we are containing the growth of money supply we re determined to give value to the currency that we ve launched and want people to believe in us we re determined to make this right said prof ncube the latest progress report on reforms issued by treasury already shows that government has scored major milestones in containing the fiscal deficit and broadening its revenue base through curbing leakages and expenditure containment the target this year is to reduce the budget deficit from about 12 percent of gdp in 2018 to five percent inflation is also expected to slow down to single digit benefitting from the fiscal consolidation measures and containment of money supply growth to below 10 percent by year end says treasury these are being complemented by the recent monetary policy statement which reintroduced the interbank foreign currency exchange and separate fca accounts and rtgs accounts these have set the tone for the implementation of currency reforms prof ncube acknowledged the problem of foreign currency shortage in the economy and the struggle that depositors went through in seeking to withdraw their cash from banks although zimbabwe adopted the us dollar as its major currency under the multiple currency regime in 2009 prof ncube said the cash squeeze was inevitable as the country does not print us dollars and does not have an agreement with the us government for the supply of the greenback so money ran out so but imagine that now if you have domestic currency that you re able to print that you control then we will not have this problem he said the minister said president mnangagwa s zimbabwe is open for business message was genuine and was being expressed in the ongoing reforms meant to create a favourable investment climate and an inclusive economic growth he said the recent mdc alliance instigated violent protests that resulted in wanton destruction of property and looting of businesses were regrettable and exposed institutional gaps created by the departure of the old regime as the intensity of protests overwhelmed the law enforcement agents he however commended president mnangagwa for coming out very strongly and clear in condemning violence from both sides i think that is a very very strong statement said prof ncube as i say it is really about the ability to cope with such intense protests in a situation where some of the state institutions are not as strong because their power is eroded by a this leader who was there for too long herald

civilians or to be suspended from the grouping the tmc took over after president omar al bashir was ousted on april 11 any suspension of sudan s au membership could affect the tmc s efforts to win international recognition as the country s legitimate rulers during an interim period of up to two years and thus delay any aid to the country that has been trying to cope with a dire economic crisis

run the transitional period the tmc has resisted pressure to hand power to civilians but has said it was ready to accept a civilian government of technocrats to run the country during an interim

owen ullmann opinion columnist president donald trump s new federal budget proposal unveiled monday underscores the conviction of his budget director and acting white house chief of staff mick mulvaney that nobody cares anymore about chronically large deficits and a steadily growing national debt that s what mulvaney told congressional republicans last month when they asked why trump ignored mention of the deficit in his state of the union address according to abc news and that s why trump put out a plan that foresees annual deficits of 1 trillion or more through at least 2022 so much red ink unprecedented during a time of healthy economic growth will send the current national debt of 22 trillion surging higher along with the annual interest payments approaching 500 billion yet as mulvaney correctly observed nobody republicans democrats or most voters cares about all that red ink for a simple reason there no longer is a compelling link between deficits and harm to the economy the long time argument from a generation ago that persistent deficits would trigger inflation stunt economic growth and strangle government programs has not come to pass so emboldened congressional republicans enacted a 1 5 trillion tax cut and boosted defense spending in 2017 now democrats in congress are promoting expensive domestic programs by arguing that adding to the national debt is benign even among economists there is a growing belief that the u s government can handle its mounting debt indefinitely so long as interest rates remain low and investors around the world are lured to the safety of government bonds that finance all the debt our view deficits don t matter in donald trump s budget opposing view tax cut law helps future generations more commentary why trump s fed bashing is bad for the economy think of it this way you would have no reluctance to refinance your home mortgage indefinitely if you could get rock bottom interest rates of 3 percent which is the current yield for a 30 year u s treasury bond this thinking is wildly at odds with economic orthodoxy in the 1970s through the 1990s when deficits were blamed for every economic malady from high inflation and recessions to weak productivity and private investment ronald reagan ran for president as a budget hawk in 1980 but his policies led to record deficits but also a booming economy his successor george h w bush supported a tax hike to reduce the deficit but could not escape a weak economy that cost him re election the economy boomed again under bill clinton who produced a budget surplus which was a beneficiary of the good times not the cause and deficits did not trigger the 2007 09 financial calamity blamed on high risk housing investments rather domestic stimulus programs under president barack obama that contributed to record deficits helped nurse the economy back to health a decade after all those huge deficits under obama and now trump what has happened to the u s economy unemployment is at a 50 year low inflation is remarkably low and the economy will set a record for the longest expansion on record if growth continues into june this is strong evidence that deficits are not always evil and fiscal austerity is not always righteous policy the question we should ask is whether the government is spending wisely and taxing fairly on the first issue we know on a personal level that spending on a home improvement or child s education is a sound investment and spending on a lavish vacation we can t afford is not we should judge federal spending the same way is an increase in military spending needed for defense or a wasteful gift to contractors developing weapons we don t need are we making smart investments in education and infrastructure on taxes are we emphasizing fairness and ensuring the tax code encourages investments in jobs and new technology or is congress awarding unjustified breaks to powerful lobbyists and rich donors these are ways to focus on how we spend and tax rather than on the bottom line wise budget policy means narrowing deficits during good times when tax revenues should be rising and social welfare spending should be ebbing and not fixating on all the red ink during bad times after all the u s government has been in debt its entire existence save for one year 1835 under andrew jackson yet we have become the most powerful economy the world has ever seen that s not to say we can pile up debt recklessly and indefinitely without paying a steep price eventually investors would demand higher interest rates or shun government bonds creating a financial crisis for now however let s insist that our elected representatives spend and tax more wisely and then whatever the deficit turns out to be nobody will care owen ullmann a former economics reporter and senior editor of usa today is executive editor of the international economy magazine
among economists there is growing belief that u s can handle mounting debt indefinitely so long as interest rates remain low and investors pony up president donald trump s new federal budget proposal unveiled monday underscores the conviction of his budget director and acting white house chief of staff mick mulvaney that nobody cares anymore about chronically large deficits and a steadily growing national debt that s what mulvaney told congressional republicans last month when they asked why trump ignored mention of the deficit in his state of the union address according to abc news and that s why trump put out a plan that foresees annual deficits of 1 trillion or more through at least 2022 so much red ink unprecedented during a time of healthy economic growth will send the current national debt of 22 trillion surging higher along with the annual interest payments approaching 500 billion advertisement advertisement yet as mulvaney correctly observed nobody republicans democrats or most voters cares about all that red ink for a simple reason there no longer is a compelling link between deficits and harm to the economy the long time argument from a generation ago that persistent deficits would trigger inflation stunt economic growth and strangle government programs has not come to pass copies of president donald trump s 2020 budget proposal on march 11 2019 so emboldened congressional republicans enacted a 1 5 trillion tax cut and boosted defense spending in 2017 now democrats in congress are promoting expensive domestic programs by arguing that adding to the national debt is benign even among economists there is a growing belief that the u s government can handle its mounting debt indefinitely so long as interest rates remain low and investors around the world are lured to the safety of government bonds that finance all the debt advertisement advertisement our view deficits don t matter in donald trump s budget opposing view tax cut law helps future generations more commentary why trump s fed bashing is bad for the economy think of it this way you would have no reluctance to refinance your home mortgage indefinitely if you could get rock bottom interest rates of 3 percent which is the current yield for a 30 year u s treasury bond this thinking is wildly at odds with economic orthodoxy in the 1970s through the 1990s when deficits were blamed for every economic malady from high inflation and recessions to weak productivity and private investment advertisement advertisement ronald reagan ran for president as a budget hawk in 1980 but his policies led to record deficits but also a booming economy his successor george h w bush supported a tax hike to reduce the deficit but could not escape a weak economy that cost him re election the economy boomed again under bill clinton who produced a budget surplus which was a beneficiary of the good times not the cause and deficits did not trigger the 2007 09 financial calamity blamed on high risk housing investments rather domestic stimulus programs under president barack obama that contributed to record deficits helped nurse the economy back to health a decade after all those huge deficits under obama and now trump what has happened to the u s economy unemployment is at a 50 year low inflation is remarkably low and the economy will set a record for the longest expansion on record if growth continues into june this is strong evidence that deficits are not always evil and fiscal austerity is not always righteous policy the question we should ask is whether the government is spending wisely and taxing fairly advertisement advertisement on the first issue we know on a personal level that spending on a home improvement or child s education is a sound investment and spending on a lavish vacation we can t afford is not we should judge federal spending the same way is an increase in military spending needed for defense or a wasteful gift to contractors developing weapons we don t need are we making smart investments in education and infrastructure on taxes are we emphasizing fairness and ensuring the tax code encourages investments in jobs and new technology or is congress awarding unjustified breaks to powerful lobbyists and rich donors these are ways to focus on how we spend and tax rather than on the bottom line wise budget policy means narrowing deficits during good times when tax revenues should be rising and social welfare spending should be ebbing and not fixating on all the red ink during bad times after all the u s government has been in debt its entire existence save for one year 1835 under andrew jackson yet we have become the most powerful economy the world has ever seen that s not to say we can pile up debt recklessly and indefinitely without paying a steep price eventually investors would demand higher interest rates or shun government bonds creating a financial crisis advertisement advertisement for now however let s insist that our elected representatives spend and tax more wisely and then whatever the deficit turns out to be nobody will care owen ullmann a former economics reporter and senior editor of usa today is executive

year and reached 67 million in adjusted ebitda 2018 was a transitional year for the company that was focused on creating business diversification as well as implementing initiatives that we believe will bear fruits in 2019 and deliver material improvement in our operating cost structure going forward advertisement advertisement diversification initiatives into new crops and products represented over one third of our 2018 revenue with revenue outside of apples growing 13 for the full year 2018 this growth was led by tecnidex and its comprehensive portfolio of fungicides coatings and waxes which enjoy accelerated sales in the second half of the year and grew 9 for the full year versus 2017 on a pro forma basis from a geographic mix perspective revenue generated outside north america represented approximately 75 of the company s total revenue europe is the largest region with over 40 of sales and is being driven by the addition of tecnidex citrus business along with increased penetration impaired we also continued to build a very diversified global customer base with our top 10 customers representing only approximately 15 of our revenue collectively these aspects of our diversification strategy help offset a weaker apple crop in the pacific northwest during the fourth quarter as we look toward the future we continue to focus on delivering a more cost efficient operation that will support our growth initiatives which are comprised of organic acquisitions and strategic partnership these growth initiatives will allow us to broaden our product offering and provide us with entries into new geographies both of which we expect to help in our efforts to create further diversification in our business to deliver organic growth we are proud of our regulatory capabilities as an enabler to new product launches and geographic expansion the recent registration approvals for harvista and landspring are examples of the opportunities we continued to create through our registration capability harvista received approval in australia following our global registration strategy for the expansion of this key product landspring just received approval for tomatoes in california which now give us comprehensive coverage of the entire us tomato market the expansion into california opens a market where approximately 80 of us tomatoes are grown today advertisement advertisement please turn to slide 4 smartfresh revenue saw an overall decline of 14 in the fourth quarter of 2018 versus the prior year period and was down 3 for the full year 2018 smartfresh revenue was essentially flat for the year excluding the impact of foreign exchange and the asc 606 accounting standard for deferred revenue we saw improved dynamics in 2018 in the european apple market with a crop recovery versus last year in germany and belgium and penetration increases in italy france and portugal we also had broader traction in crops outside of apples led by pears the pacific northwest region of the us was negatively affected during the fourth quarter of 2018 by a smaller and earlier apple harvest specifically apple production by our estimates contracted approximately 15 from the pacific northwest for 2018 additionally many of our customers experienced a difficult cherry season due to the current trade dispute with china which coupled with lower than normal yields in apple put additional pressure on pricing and adversely impacted utilization of post harvest solution thanks to our broad global geographic diversification the effects of a weak apple season in the pacific northwest were offset by growth in other market crops and products in fact our pacific northwest smartfresh business today represents less than 10 of the company s total revenue we believe that 2019 will be a better season in that region with new product solutions being introduced and a more aggressive approach to harvista expansion please turn to slide 5 tecnidex contributed 18 million of revenue growth for full year 2018 and serve as a catalyst to change our culture from a one crop one technology company to a more complete post harvest business that includes a broader set of solutions such as fungicides and coatings and provides access and knowhow into the citrus market these additional expertise was particularly impactful since we estimate citrus to represent about 60 of the core global post harvest market as i previously mentioned tecnidex saw solid growth in the second half and we expect this to continue into 2019 advertisement advertisement diversifying our core business to a broader crop and product base is central to our operating strategy and we saw continued progress on this front in 2018 within our core smartfresh portfolio we continuously increased penetration of the pear market for example in argentina chile the netherlands and belgium pear revenue was up double digits collectively adding approximately 3 million in revenue growth versus the full year 2017 for full year 2018 the proportion of revenues from crops other than apples increased to 30 with the primary drivers being citrus pears bananas avocados cherries plums and melons this compared to just 19 in full year 2017 a regulatory strength is key to expanding the addressable market for our product offerings the most notable approval since our last investor call are first the smartfresh registration in the us was amended to allow core treatment with our actimist foggable fungicide solution this is a key approval especially for the pacific northwest since it will support our service bundling strategy second smartfresh protabs today represents 60 of our total smartfresh revenue we have continued to expand protabs approvals into other crops in europe such as melon peach nectarine apricot pear and kiwifruit we anticipate protabs will continue to increase the shape of smartfresh applications in 2019 as a reminder protabs are under patent protection through 2022 third landspring this is a product applied in the nursery to better manage the spreads of transplanted seedlings into the field we obtained approval in 2016 for introducing tomatoes in the eastern half of the us and have recently extended this approval to california which represents 80 of the total us production opening an approximate 5 million to 6 million addressable market we sell landspring through a third party with limited dedicated internal resources and enjoy attractive gross margins and four we achieve our first sales of smartfresh in india and are running customer trials in anticipation of future approval in that market advertisement advertisement please turn to slide six harvista is our near harvest synergistic solution that complements smartfresh harvista helps slow respiration and the ripening process while the food is still on the tree promoting fruit firmness and quality for an extended period for the full year 2018 sales of harvista were down 7 driven by the negative factors in the pacific northwest that we have touched on earlier however we strongly believe that we will return to growth in 2019 based on the positive results our customers continue to experience when applying harvista we will couple this with a more aggressive commercial effort that will include the appointment of a pre harvest distributor to expand our acreage reach we also see expanded growth for harvista in other regions and in other crops such as cherries in the united states where successful trials during 2018 indicated an average 10 increase in yield which is significant additionally expanded regulatory approvals for harvista have continued with the additions of blueberries in chile and the recent approval for apples in australia the total addressable global market for blueberries is approximately 120 000 acres and for palm fruits which include apples and pears we estimate the global addressable market is almost 900 000 acres concerning australia apples we estimate it represents an addressable market of 8 million to 10 million please turn to slide 7 tecnidex is regional leader in the post harvest citrus segment that is providing agrofresh crop and technology diversification by an established portfolio of fungicides coatings and waxes expanding into fungicides it is a key driver of product diversification strategy since these product categories currently represents approximately 20 of total post harvest market sales with a high penetration in global citrus and apples in the us advertisement advertisement tecnidex contributed 21 million of revenue in the full year 2018 and grew 9 on a pro forma basis for full year 2018 the strong performance in the fourth quarter was supported by a fully integrated portfolio and alignment within our sales team we were able to leverage tecnidex s deep expertise and long established relationships with key fungicide producers to launch into cherries in chile and we are planning to expanding apples during 2019 additionally we are planning to initiate pilot sales in 2019 with citrus customers in california and aim to accelerate expansion in 2020 together these collective efforts give us confidence that we will be able to continue to deliver meaningful growth for the tecnidex business in 2019 please turn to slide 8 ripelock is the ideal solution to extend yellow life of bananas another four to six days and reduce shrink for the retailer although still growing from a small base our ripelock revenue more than doubled for the full year 2018 compared to the prior year during 2018 the ripelock solution was used in about 1 800 grocery stores worldwide 700 more than the previous year in 2019 we re expecting further expansion of the number of stores as we enter new markets such as australia in fact we currently have more than 10 ongoing trials with large retailers in the us europe and australia the collaboration with del monte has been key to expanding our pipeline and reach into the us grocery market we have also initiated the strategy to expand ripelock into other crops such as broccoli and avocado and during the second quarter of 2019 we are planning to run test with potential customers both are among the highest growing and more profitable fresh products category we continue to develop our new product pipeline through internal r d and through strategic partnerships we will have more news on these initiatives in due time please turn to slide 9 in july 2018 we officially launched freshcloud our cloud based platform for monitoring product s quality through the supply chain freshcloud provides key data above fruit freshness and health that can be translated into actionable insights that help customers along the fresh product supply chain and maximize their return as data backed solutions become a standard that transforms the post harvest industry we believe agrofresh is in an ideal position to lead this initiative based on our decades long proprietary global data collection and technical expertise we are leveraging our ongoing pagoda collaboration to monitor quality and predict shelf life for fresh fruits including cherries imported into china although freshcloud revenues during 2018 were modest we expect to make progress in 2019 as we continue to expand and build our digital platform advertisement advertisement i ll now let graham speak to some of the financial highlights graham graham miao chief financial officer thank you jordi and good afternoon to everyone on the call please turn to slide 11 let me review the financial highlights for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2018 beginning with net sales i would like to remind everyone of the geographic seasonality of our sales throughout the year sales in the southern hemisphere are concentrated in the first half of the year and the sales in the northern hemisphere are concentrated in the second half of the year as a result our fourth quarter is positively influenced by our smartfresh franchise in a northern market now turning to the financials net sales for the fourth quarter of 2018 decreased 1 5 from 54 1 million to 53 3 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 despite a decline in north america our business benefited from the global reach and ability to serve customers worldwide europe s core post harvest smartfresh business delivered strong 21 growth year over year as a reminder europe represented 40 of our overall company revenue in 2018 tecnidex a business which we acquired controlling interest in december 2017 to complement our post harvest portfolio generated 7 revenue growth to 7 8 million in the fourth quarter 2018 versus the same period last year advertisement advertisement as jordi mentioned in his remarks our north america smartfresh business was impacted by several factors in the fourth quarter including a smaller apple crop size and a shorter season that affected both smartfresh and harvista for the full year 2018 net sales increased 9 to 178 8 million the increase was driven by the addition of tecnidex which contributed growth of 18 1 million along with smartfresh growth in europe partially offset by declines in the pacific northwest of the united states due to our ongoing diversification strategy and the addition of tecnidex smartfresh sales in the pacific northwest represented less than 10 of the company s overall revenue in 2018 for the full year tecnidex delivered 20 8 million in revenue representing a solid 9 growth year over year this acquisition has performed well for us and it has expanded our post harvest services to the citrus market we have begun to take advantage of opportunities to leverage the tecnidex products into areas such as the americas where agrofresh already has strong customer relationships now let me add additional color to the net sales drivers as a reminder the 9 revenue growth for the full year included tecnidex total organic sales without tecnidex were approximately 158 million representing a 2 4 decline in the full year 2018 versus 2017 foreign exchange driven by the euro and the impact of deferred revenue from asc 606 had a combined effect of 1 5 reduction in sales excluding the impact of foreign exchange and asc 606 accounting our base business remained essentially flat please turn to slide 12 where we ll discuss margin in the fourth quarter our gross margin was 74 9 and it was consistent with expectations as we execute our strategy of diversifying revenue mix with a broader assortment of product solutions such as tecnidex harvista and the ripelock for the full year 2018 gross profit increased 1 to 132 5 million compared to the full year 2017 gross margins for the full year 2018 decreased to 74 1 from 80 1 in the prior year also reflecting our diversification initiatives strategic pricing in our core business and the impact of asc 606 deferred revenue turning to slide 13 we continue to be focused on cost optimization to create greater efficiency for our business and to better align our operating structure with our revenue base we began to see the results of these initiatives in the fourth quarter of 2018 where operating expenses including r d and sg a decreased 9 to 19 2 million versus the prior year excluding tecnidex which added 3 million operating expenses were down 15 to 17 6 million in the fourth quarter compared to prior year on a full year basis operating expenses increased 5 to 79 6 million driven by the addition of tecnidex excluding tecnidex which contributed 6 4 million operating expense were reduced by 2 5 to 73 2 million for the full year compared to 2017 now let me talk about specific expense items research and development expenses were 3 6 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 down slightly versus the prior year period for the full year 2018 r d expenses was stable compared to the prior year at 13 9 million this included 1 2 million of additional r d expenses related to the citrus programs at tecnidex r d spending reflected our resource allocation strategy that supports initiatives that drive continued diversification beyond apple selling general and administrative expenses including tecnidex were 15 6 million on a reported basis for the fourth quarter down 11 versus prior year excluding tecnidex sg a expenses were 14 7 million down 14 for the full year selling general and administrative expenses including tecnidex were 65 8 million up 6 versus 2017 excluding tecnidex sg a expenses were 60 6 million and down 1 for the year going forward we expect our cost optimization initiatives which began to yield results in the fourth quarter 2018 to generate full year benefits in 2019 please turn to slide 14 net loss was 1 9 million in the fourth quarter versus net income of 23 4 million in the year ago period the decrease was mainly driven by 24 million one time mark to market gain in 2017 related to the tax receivables agreement was down as a result of 2017 us tax reform for the full year 2018 net loss was 30 2 million compared to net income of 23 6 million in 2017 as a reminder last year net income benefited from aforementioned tra mark to market gain gains on foreign exchange of 13 million and 14 million of benefit as a result of a deferred tax evaluation allowance of reversal the current year net loss was driven by the amortization of intangibles of approximately 46 million adjusted ebitda was down 0 9 million to 24 4 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 versus the prior year period for the full year 2018 adjusted ebitda was essentially flat at 67 million the full year number was driven by higher sales offset by the impact of lower gross margin and a higher selling general and administrative expenses related to the tecnidex acquisition turn to slide 15 cash provided by operations was 3 million for the full year 2018 compared to 35 4 million in the prior year period the year over year change was driven by an increase in trade working capital of 17 9 million timing of interest payments on our long term debt year over year interest payments were higher by 15 8 million because we made five payments in 2018 compared to three payments in 2017 along with higher interest rates we also saw higher cash tax payments of 3 7 million related to unrealized foreign currency gains in france in 2018 which will be non recurring these were partially offset by a 4 million cash received from the settlement of an interest rate swap capital expenditures were 4 2 million for the full year 2018 compared to 7 7 million in a year ago period our asset light business model accounts for limited capital expenditures which generally range from 3 to 5 of sales annually beyond operating activities we used 13 9 million to satisfy obligations now 6 1 million for repayment of long term debt 2 2 million for a contractual payment to complete our 75 purchase of tecnidex and 1 6 million related to the verigo acquisition in 2018 from a balance sheet perspective cash as of december 31st 2018 was 34 9 million total debt was 412 9 million with no meaningful maturities until july 2021 our revolver was undrawn as of december 31st 2018 subsequent to the quarter end on january 31st 2019 we signed an agreement to extend our existing revolving credit facility from july 31st 2019 to december 31st 2020 and amended certain financial covenants which increased our ability to access the revolver we believe that 12 5 million amended facility is right sized for our current need and it contains more advantageous terms for us to utilize the facility this new revolver will give us the financial flexibility to meet the company s working capital need and is an important first step in our efforts to optimize our capital structure now i ll turn the call back to jordi for his closing remarks before opening the call to q a jordi ferre chief executive officer thank you graham please turn to slide 16 as i mentioned at the outset 2018 was a transitional year for the company we have refocused the enterprise and sustainable growth and i m confident that we now have the right leadership team in place to meet our goals and look forward to delivering solid results in 2019 during the year we intend to deliver organic net sales growth with a focus on building a more diversified business and expect the cost optimization initiatives that were put in place in 2018 to continue to yield benefits throughout 2019 additionally we are working toward improving the health of our balance sheet to ensure that we can support our long term growth strategies that are necessary to meet our diversification initiatives and with that operator please open the line for questions thank you questions and answers operator at this time we ll be conducting a question and answer session operator instructions our first question comes the line of roger duan from rf lafferty please proceed with your question mr duan your line is live roger duan rf lafferty analyst good afternoon can you guys hear me operator yeah roger duan rf lafferty analyst okay hi jordi hey graham hi so couple of questions first of all it looks like apple production in europe is going to be up substantially this year according to usda forecast can you guys confirm this are you guys seeing this as well and maybe give us a little bit more color on this jordi ferre chief executive officer hi roger jordi here speaking yes i think we mentioned that in the call that the european production apple production was up i think we mentioned specifically some countries in central europe so that definitely is confirmed roger duan rf lafferty analyst yeah yeah because they did mentioned it was something like 40 increase year over year so i just want to confirm the magnitude of the increase okay second can you guys update us on the progress of freshcloud i noticed that you guys attended oppenheimer s blockchain summit maybe talk a little bit more about the blockchain and how is it going to playing your freshcloud offering jordi ferre chief executive officer yes so the freshcloud as we said before is a journey as we build the platform across the whole supply chain in kind of measuring all the information on real time and to be able to make to help our customers make a good decision on predicting shelf life of products et cetera and prioritizing products over others depending on the freshness of the food that is being shipped yes we did attend the blockchain conference and i think that eventually at a certain point once we have a solid platform we could potentially turn these into a blockchain opportunity roger duan rf lafferty analyst all right okay thanks the final question are you guys looking to acquire the rest of the tecnidex seeing the growth provided by this segment jordi ferre chief executive officer we have sort an agreement with the previous owner and i don t think that s public so in due time i guess things can happen but at this point in time at least we refer back to the agreement that we signed which is a private agreement roger duan rf lafferty analyst okay no problem okay graham miao chief financial officer we own larger roger duan rf lafferty analyst go ahead graham graham miao chief financial officer it s graham so we own 75 so can stop that their operations in to our financial statements roger duan rf lafferty analyst okay yeah no problem okay understood thank you so much graham miao chief financial officer thank you operator operator instructions our next question comes from line of gerry sweeney from roth capital please proceed with your question gerard sweeney roth capital partners analyst hey good afternoon jordi and graham thanks for taking my call jordi ferre chief executive officer hi gerry gerard sweeney roth capital partners analyst just a question on tecnidex obviously it s been a good acquisition for you on a few fronts and i think you did touch up on it a little bit in the prepared comments but can you go a little bit further into maybe some of the post harvest citrus market opportunity you re seeing there and then a follow up to that would be maybe some synergies to expect from tecnidex now that it s fully integrated to agrofresh thank you jordi ferre chief executive officer right so in the growth opportunities that we see in citrus is obviously there are two areas one is i think when we combined the name agrofresh with a new offering in citrus i think customers generally speaking because of our name are very receptive to that second the tecnidex has also been playing for a while in certain countries that are going to be growth countries in the citrus business i m talking about the middle east in places like egypt turkey these are places that the company made early bet morocco these are growing markets for citrus the company had made an earlier bet and with the addition of agrofresh we intend to speed up we also have intentions to grow in areas like south africa and in latin america where the company had just started as well to try to introduce their products so i think what we do in agrofresh is two things one is i think combining the name because i think agrofresh has a strong name and a good reputation in the market combined with our resources as well in those markets let s remember that tecnidex was a privately owned company that was trying to expand at their own pace what we ve done is basically we ve put them on a much higher speed to actually achieve this growth opportunities gerard sweeney roth capital partners analyst got it and then what about maybe discussing some of the synergies we expect on a go forward basis now that it s fully integrated anything on that front jordi ferre chief executive officer well there is some synergies that we re working on to capture that will be more related to improving our supply chain that s going to be a very important thing they tecnidex has a strong base in spain which is actually in the valencia area it s a good area to actually try to be integrated in our supply chain and how we move different products not only from them but from us as well in terms of doing some manufacturing in that facility et cetera which will be beneficial to us from a synergy standpoint and obviously we do see a lot of synergies in terms of the sales synergies right and i think we feel that toward the end of the year especially when we had a full impact and we see that continuing as well the acquisition was especially driven by synergies so i want to make sure that s understood gerard sweeney roth capital partners analyst got it okay i appreciate it thank you jordi ferre chief executive officer yeah thank you operator our next question comes from line of james jang from maxim group please proceed with your question james jang maxim group analyst hey good afternoon guys jordi ferre chief executive officer good afternoon how are you graham miao chief financial officer good afternoon james james jang maxim group analyst doing well so just a lot of questions have been answered but as we move toward 2019 so what do you feel as the greatest revenue opportunity you see something happening in ripelock where that could grow exponentially with the partnership to help the top line what do you think is more of diversification and tecnidex helping you get into other sectors that you really don t have strong presence in jordi ferre chief executive officer of course we always would hope that things would take an exponential path i mean there is a possibility obviously all the stars line up in one year that we could actually get through that however i think that would you would see in 19 is the same trend that you see in 18 in terms of our diversification strategies we ll go deeper into the growth of the company i think that some of the hiccups that we ve seen like harvista will be back on track this year and so i think that you will see even with the results you ve seen this year will be improved next year in terms of growth based on the diversification initiatives in terms of having something that could be exponential we re very prudent here i think we take one step at a time and all the steps have to be solid toward that sustainable growth james jang maxim group analyst okay that s fair and with ripelock and everything else have you had any further discussions with larger grocers in the us meaning has there been more of pull factor in terms of your product jordi ferre chief executive officer i think i mentioned in my previous remarks that i disclosed that there were 10 there is more than that but 10 large grocery sales right now going on i think i mentioned that i disclosed it james jang maxim group analyst yeah jordi ferre chief executive officer so yes i think that shows that we re in full activity in doing trials trials sometimes can be at a little bit long because they take a while to prepare a while to roll out and some time also to evaluate results and then there is the time logical for big companies to make decisions to do that so we could so again we re on the right track here based on the pipeline and the number of trials that we have right now james jang maxim group analyst okay great and one last one i know you don t have your exact numbers but what do you think the market opportunity for the cherries in chile could be once they get mature jordi ferre chief executive officer you are referring yourself right now cherries in chile or because we talk about blueberries in chile you re talking about harvista right now am i james jang maxim group analyst no tecnidex jordi ferre chief executive officer i m sorry i m sorry james jang maxim group analyst you can expand it the new jordi ferre chief executive officer yes yes i m sorry i m sorry yes yes so i don t have the exact number how much would that be but i will tell you that the opportunity in the harvista let me put it this way in cherries harvista chile has 35 000 acres of cherries fungicide itself i haven t really assessed the total potential i can tell you is that it s not small we re talking about an opportunity in the millions james jang maxim group analyst okay all right got you all right that s all i had thanks guys jordi ferre chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from line of daniel jester from citigroup global markets please proceed with your question daniel jester citigroup global markets analyst yeah hi good morning good afternoon everyone i wanted to ask you a bit on the your current strategy for smartfresh i think it s my understanding that in 2019 you have more patents for the in calculation technology rolling off in parts of europe parts as asia pacific and also canada so i was wondering if you can just comment about how you may adjust your business now that some more patents are rolling off jordi ferre chief executive officer welcome back dan it s good to have you here so on your question about patents i mean i ve been saying that for a while the main patent expires 2014 that was the used patent and so we ve been public to say that we ve been facing competition ever since the patent you are actually addressing is the encapsulation patent and that is not even today our main application method we have protabs our main application method but i will tell you this and in my experience competition in this market happens when you have providers of service in the post harvest market and so the fact that a patent expires doesn t mean that we re going to have a multiplication of different competitors it means that the competitors that we know and they are in a market and have certain reputation to the service can have access to that those that can be a more serious competitors have had access to that product now in a different application now for three years so although obviously nobody likes to have patents that expire i don t think it s going to be that much of a dramatic correction as some of the people have been assessing graham miao chief financial officer and also dan it s graham it s also important to point out that you mentioned canada and the east coast the united states and then as jordi mentioned that we already using mostly protabs in those regions instead of the powder encapsulation formula that you referred to daniel jester citigroup global markets analyst got you thank you that s very helpful clarification on ripelock in the slide deck you talked about adding 700 stores in the us which by my math added a couple million dollars so i m just wondering what the open opportunity is if you have to add a very large number of stores every year just to get a few million dollars of revenue is there a way to accelerate that is that is this sort of revenue per store low only because you re in the trial phases can you just talk about how you see that ramping up over the next two years jordi ferre chief executive officer yes it s a very good question yes the average store revenue will increase based on two factors number one as you lend bigger stronger grocers that turn more products per store and the stores are larger obviously you re going to have better sales per store so again as you improve your or you re getting larger grocers in to your customer base second yes there is some incidence in terms of trials obviously but generally speaking trials the only thing that they do actually they should measure the same as in real life so i don t think that s the impact the biggest impact really is adding more quality stores and quality grocers to your grocer store ph customers daniel jester citigroup global markets analyst got you and then maybe one last one for graham can you just talk a bit about philosophically how you think about the balance sheet how rapidly do you feel like you need to delever it or are there other tools that you can use to give jordi some more firepower to go acquire some more company thank you jordi ferre chief executive officer thank you as well graham miao chief financial officer yeah sure so the balance sheet capital structure in general improvement has been on our radar screen so as you see that we are very proactive thinking about and also working with our advisors very actively evaluating the opportunities out there in the marketplace so the way we see over the next over time certainly before the maturities so we ve got some time to put that put into action so first and foremost as we announced in january that is the to fix the existing revolver so that s just a first step to make it more user friendly but also extend the maturity by a year and a half so that certainly will give the company opportunity financial flexibility to look at the marketplace our overall capital structure and a debt refinancing opportunity later on so to for overall deleveraging strategy for us with first and foremost that we are focusing on our business internal organic growth as jordi mentioned we have several products that our baseline business is becoming more stable and we also have some growing brands that we re putting resources behind so in addition as you mentioned we are very opportunistically looking at some suitable targets in the marketplace ready to leverage our strong market position globally to tapping those tapping to those opportunities so overall we are active and it s on our radar screen operator and ladies and gentlemen at this time i m showing no further questions i d like to end the question and answer session and turn the conference call back over to management for any closing remarks jordi ferre chief executive officer thank you very much to everybody that attended the call thank you

a key measure of underlying u s inflation unexpectedly eased in february amid falling prices for autos and prescription drugs giving the federal reserve more room to stick to its plan for being patient on raising interest rates excluding food and energy the so called core consumer price index rose 0 1 percent from the prior month and 2 1 percent from a year earlier according to a labor department report tuesday those figures trailed the median estimates of economists the broader cpi rose 0 2 percent from january the first increase in four months though the 1 5 percent annual gain missed projections and was the smallest rise since 2016 u s stock futures and treasuries rose while the dollar fell as the data suggest there s a greater chance that inflation won t hold up around the fed s 2 percent objective a development that would discourage policy makers from additional rate increases amid rising risks from weakening global growth the report is certainly consistent with the view that we are going to be tracking at or below the fed s official goal said scott brown chief economist at raymond james financial inc in st petersburg florida so there s no real pressure for the fed to move anytime soon pressures from tariffs and wages have produced mixed results in terms of firms ability to raise the prices of the goods and services they produce brown said fed chairman jerome powell made clear friday that he and his colleagues are in no hurry to adjust interest rates as growth slows and inflation stays subdued with nothing in the outlook demanding an immediate policy response and particularly given muted inflation pressures the committee has adopted a patient wait and see approach he said in a speech in california responding to questions powell said inflation in the u s is low stable and doesn t react much to slack in the economy policy makers will release updated quarterly projections for interest rates as well as inflation growth and employment when they gather march 19 20 fed target the fed has a 2 percent target for a separate inflation gauge from the commerce department that s linked to consumer spending that index tends to run slightly below the labor department s cpi and january figures are due march 29 the cpi report showed prices of new vehicles fell for the first time in four months while used car prices dropped 0 7 percent from january the biggest drop since september prescription drug prices fell 1 percent on a monthly basis the most on record bringing the annual decline to 1 2 percent the largest drop since 1972 such figures give president donald trump another opportunity to claim credit for lower pharmaceutical prices an issue that he s recently tweeted about several times shelter costs which account for about a third of cpi and mainly include housing expenses continued to hold up with the fourth straight monthly increase of 0 3 percent owners equivalent rent one of the categories designed to track rental prices rose 0 3 percent as did rent of primary residence the slowdown in overall inflation is giving americans more spending power a separate labor department report on wednesday showed that average hourly earnings adjusted for inflation rose 1 9 percent in february from a year earlier that compares with 1 6 percent in the previous month and is the fastest pace since 2015 get more economists had forecast a 0 2 percent gain in the monthly core gauge and a 2 2 percent annual advance apparel prices rose 0 3 percent from the prior month as men s and boys apparel had a record increase of 3 4 percent while women s apparel fell 1 6 percent the most in almost a year energy prices rose 0 4 percent the first increase in four months as gasoline prices advance 1 5 percent food costs gained 0 4 percent the biggest increase since 2014 expenses for medical care fell 0 2 percent the biggest decline since 2013 these readings often vary from results for this category within the fed s preferred measure of inflation due to different methodologies bloomberg content is for general information purposes only it is not investment advice or a solution to buy or sell securities opinions are the authors not necessarily that of oanda business information services inc or any of its affiliates subsidiaries officers or directors if you would like to reproduce or redistribute any of the content found on marketpulse an award winning forex commodities and global indices analysis and news site service produced by oanda business information services inc please access the rss feed or contact us at info marketpulse com visit to find out more about the beat of the global markets 2023 oanda business information services inc

question these economists who propose this mmt claim that since the u s borrows in its own currency it can print dollars to cover its obligations and can t go broke the theory has won converts among freshman democrats like alexandria ocasio cortez as a way to finance such social policies as the green new deal and medicare for all there seems to be something seriously wrong here you have taught me to see the world as a whole i think these people have blinders on and do not take into account foreign ownership of us debt would you comment on that aspect please jg answer very good yes we are all connected and these people behind mmt are idiots this is the same old story that we can just print our way out because we owe money to ourselves that is a nice naive theory which reflects the ignorance of those behind mmt at the end of 2018 foreigners owned about 6 2 trillion of u s debt or approximately 42 of the total national debt meanwhile the american public institutions held 16 1 trillion and 23 of the national debt the sheer numbers available from the government prove what they are saying is not true their theory that mmt is possible because we borrow from ourselves is just absurd they assume that we can borrow indefinitely and just print money to cover the expenses the fallacy here involves the simple fact that 42 of the debt is held by foreigners that reality exists because the dollar is the reserve currency as europe is drowning in its socialism federally the states have income taxes but not a consumption tax in europe you have an income tax that is higher than the usa by at least 20 and then on top of that you have a 20 vat consumption tax additionally there are mountains of municipal taxes and all sorts of regulations and fees the usa has the biggest consumer economy because the consumer is left with nearly one third more of their income as disposable to spend compared to europeans add the fact that the usa also has never canceled its currency and therefore the us dollar is used internationally about 60 of american dollars all circulate outside the united states clearly mmt would also disrupt the entire world economy the theory that qe proves them correct is seriously wrong the world is in a deflationary trend the dollars are in high demand because it is going nuts everywhere else the increase in the supply of dollars has not been inflationary only because the world is sucking them up they do not understand the demand is global not domestic remember the money plane skids after skids were being shipped outside the usa of 100 bills to supply the demand worldwide when that demand shifts their entire theory of mmt will blow up in their face qe is not proof that what they propose can work they are ignoring the international trends that are supporting the dollar right now
overview last minutes statements meant to clarify what many mps find to be the most odious part of the withdrawal bill the backstop for the irish border is goosed global equity markets even though it does not seem as if the withdrawal bill has changed one iota and after the big rally in u s shares yesterday there might have been follow through buying in any case today asian markets did not disappoint nearly all of the major bourses were up over one percent and several of the larger indices gapped higher including the the and south korea s europe s also gapped higher but was trying to fill the gap in the morning session the three dollar a barrel increase in the price of the rally in equities appears to be sapping the strength of the bond market yields are mostly 1 2 bp firmer there are a couple of exceptions u k are up four basis points while on the other side of the spectrum greece s is a couple of basis points softer even after the eurogroup of european finance ministers delayed the first post aid package payout due to lack of performance the funds are expected to be delivered next month the is weaker against nearly all the world s currencies snapped a seven day slide yesterday traded almost to 1 33 today after dipped below 1 29 to start the week among the g10 currencies the is heavier in the risk on mood while the and are also struggling among the emerging markets currencies the has slid following comments by the central bank governor warned its currency is already strong and seemed to threaten intervention if it got stronger asia pacific weak south korean trade data for the first part of march showed yesterday continued to show powerful headwinds however other reports suggest asian trade may have begun improving earlier today the philippines reported that exports fell less than expected january exports fell by 1 7 less than half of what economists expected imports rose by 5 8 economists expected around a 4 decline part of the difference seems to be industry specific in south korea for example semiconductor exports have fallen by more than a quarter though today the semiconductor equities turned in a strong showing at the same time japan does not appear to have emerged from its economic funk yesterday japan reported that preliminary february machine tool orders fell by a little more than 29 it is the fourth month of double digit losses and is nearly evenly split between domestic and foreign demand a survey by the ministry of finance found sentiment among manufacturers to be the worst in three years the bank of japan meets later this week no one expects a change in stance now but a bloomberg survey found that 37 expected the boj s next move to be easing policy more than double the number from january it is expected that the boj lower its outlook for output and exports the australian dollar held 0 7000 last week perhaps helped by some large options struck there it is advancing for its third consecutive session and has tested the 0 7080 area which corresponds to a 38 2 retracement of the decline from late february the 50 retracement is seen near 0 7100 the real test for the bears might be in the 0 7125 to 0 7150 area today there is an a 765 mln 0 7050 option the dollar is continuing to recover against the yen after falling to about jpy110 80 at the end of last week it is trading near jpy111 50 today last week s high was near jpy112 15 options at jpy111 55 for 570 mln will roll off today the strengthened for the first time in nine sessions europe there is one overriding issue today and it is brexit the house of commons is scheduled to vote later today on the withdrawal bill there are claims that a new concession was made by the ec but this is spin the withdrawal bill was not re open or changed what has changed is that parts of the withdrawal bill are being emphasized to ease fears that the irish backstop locks the u k indefinitely however the withdrawal bill does have clauses that spell out conditions on which the u k s obligations could cease including if an independent panel judges that the other side is not negotiating in good faith and is seeking to make the backstop permanent moreover as a sovereign power the u k reserves the right to unilaterally decide on its own to leave the backstop the withdrawal bill lost by a historic margin a couple months ago the events markets predictit org are still favoring some kind of postponement sterling s three cent advance off yesterday s lows warns of the vulnerability of a defeat of the bill today if it is defeated the house of commons will vote tomorrow on leaving without an agreement if that too fails to secure a majority then a vote thursday will be held to seek an extension separately the u k reported a series of better than expected data consider that january monthly gdp rose 0 5 the median call was for a 0 2 increase after a 0 4 decline in december this reflected the 0 6 gain in industrial production and a 0 8 rise in manufacturing output both were expected to be up 0 2 after falling 0 5 and 0 7 respectively in december construction output rose 2 8 after falling 1 8 at the end of last year the exception to the better than expected news was the trade balance it deteriorated which might have been exaggerated by the quicker u k economic bounce back compared with some of its main trading partners see eu and u s despite the economic data sterling continues to pare the gains scored on the initial news of a deal and is near european session lows as u s dealers return to their posts there are about gbp555 mln options in the 1 3150 1 3165 area that expire today but may be in play there is also almost gbp260 mln at 1 33 sterling had fallen seven sessions in a row before yesterday it reached almost 1 3290 today after recording a low near 1 2950 yesterday the high from the end of february was near 1 3350 the euro is advancing for the third consecutive session the dovish ecb last week saw the single currency dip below 1 12 it traded near 1 1285 today just above the 1 1280 strike for nearly 570 mln euros that expires today as we have noted there are large amounts struck at 1 1250 today the expiring option is for 1 3 bln euros tomorrow there are 1 4 bln euros struck at 1 1250 america over the weekend fed chief powell indicated he was watching the january retail sales data for signs that the consumer bounced back and they did retail sales were well above expectations the downward revisions to the december series make the bounce back all the more impressive and underscore our sense that the collapse of the world economy at the end of last year was exaggerated today the u s reports february consumer prices the median forecast is for a 0 2 increase in both the headline and core rates which would keep the year over year rates steady at 1 6 and 2 2 respectively the markets may be more sensitive to an upside than a downside surprise the u s treasury brings 24 bln 10 year notes to market today yesterday s 38 three year note sale produced a five basis point decline in the high yield compared with last month but this did not dissuade investors as the bid cover was slightly firmer and indirect bidders took 49 5 up from a little less than 46 last time the last 10 year note sale saw a high yield of almost 2 69 and produced a bid cover of 2 35 the indirect bidders took down almost 60 of the issue the average over the last ten auctions is closer to 63 despite firm equity and oil prices the canadian dollar is underperforming one weight may be coming from interest rate differentials the two year spread favors the u s by 83 bp it saw 85 bp last week before easing but this is really the upper end of where the u s premium has been since before the great financial crisis after shooting up from around cad1 3150 at the end of february to almost cad1 3470 last week the u s dollar is consolidating around cad1 34 support is seen near cad1 3350 the u s dollar is pulling back from last week s high near mxn19 62 initial support is seen today around mxn19 29
general development describe the areas of energy development in the country switzerland has very little fossil fuels and currently relies heavily on the import of oil gas coal as well as on its own hydraulic and nuclear power capacity to meet its overall energy requirements while domestic hydropower is set to remain the main source of electric energy in the country interest in other clean energies has developed and increased this trend occurs much to the expense of nuclear energy to this day the second most important source of electric energy in the country accordingly switzerland now places a greater focus upon the research and development of renewable power sources such as wind solar waste incineration and biogas additionally a step by step strategy to reduce and ultimately end the country s nuclear power capacity is in place so that when the current plants reach the end of their service life they shall not be replaced with new ones role of government describe the government s role in the ownership and development of energy resources outline the current energy policy with regard to the ownership and development of energy resources both the federal government as well as the governments of each canton play a role the federal government is solely responsible for legislation in the field of nuclear energy and in the field of energy transport in particular the transmission and distribution systems for the transport of liquid or gaseous fuels the federal government is further competent to establish regulatory principles eg environmental protection on the exploitation of energy resources and on the economic and efficient use of energy each canton has ownership over the natural resources that are located upon or within its territory accordingly energy companies must obtain concessions or licences from the canton to exploit natural resources on its soil the cantons may also expropriate land against appropriate compensation to either promote or prevent the exploitation of natural resources governments at both levels ie federal and cantonal regularly own substantial participation in companies that produce or distribute energy finally the cantons and the federal government actively participate in the energieschweiz programme to effectively implement their energy and climate objectives currently the national energy policy focuses greatly on fossil fuels which are the country s primary source of energy electricity is second in line mainly driven by hydraulic and nuclear plants the federal government has however set itself a 20 per cent reduction target of fossil fuel consumption and a 50 per cent increase target of the share of renewable energies by 2020 the general aim of swiss energy policy is to guarantee a secure economic and ecological energy supply commercial civil law substantive rules and industry standards describe any industry standard form contracts used in the energy sector in your jurisdiction most energy providers will use standard terms and conditions when entering into contracts with consumers or smes the content and form thereof will vary depending on the energy sector but common features are often the indefinite term of the agreement and the influence of the source of the consumed energy fully or partly renewable on the contractual prices with regard to b2b contractual relationships standard form contracts are regularly published by each industry s governing body as a matter of example the association of swiss electricity companies vse aes has issued a set of 13 standard form contracts covering most of the field of electricity production and distribution similarly the association for wood energy awe published several templates in connection with wood energy heat supply access to heating networks what rules govern contractual interpretation in non consumer contracts in general do these rules apply to energy contracts the rules of the swiss code of obligations co and the corresponding case law govern the contractual interpretation under swiss law under swiss law contractual interpretation is based on the real and common intention of the parties at the time when they entered the contract to determine what the real and common intention of the parties is a judge may consider all the circumstances of the case at hand including pre and post signing behaviour of the parties in particular the intention of the parties and thus the true nature of the contract may differ from the contractual wording in cases where the real and common intention of the parties cannot be established the judge must interpret the parties declarations according to the principle of good faith ie how a reasonable person in the situation of one of the parties would have understood the declaration of the other party these general rules also apply to energy contracts governed by swiss law describe any commonly recognised industry standards for establishing liability guidelines and recommendations issued by each industry s governing body may be considered by the courts in order to establish if a breach of a duty of care has occurred this may even be the case if the guideline or standard in question has not been explicitly included in the contract these guidelines or standards are specifically issued in connection with a given aspect of a particular energy segment for instance the association of swiss wastewater and water protection experts issued a series of technical guidelines with regard to wastewater discharge into water bodies in rainy weather another example is the directive on the safety of dams issued by the competent surveillance section of the swiss federal office of energy with regard to liability the relevant benchmark is set by the parties to the contract and alternatively by the general legal rules on contractual liability as a general rule and unless the parties agree otherwise a party will be held liable for a breach of contract caused negligently negligence is defined under swiss law as the failure to act in accordance to the level of care commonly required under the given circumstances in turn gross negligence means that the breaching party acted in disregard of the most basic duty of care or out of indifference under swiss law any attempt to exclude liability for gross negligence by means of contract will be deemed void and thus ineffective it must also be noted that most statutes relating to the energy sector contain specific provision regarding tort liabilities and damages in connection with such industries these are usually stricter than the aforementioned standards for example in the case of nuclear exploitation the operator will be liable without limitation for any damages from a nuclear origin caused by nuclear substances on the installation unless he or she can prove that the damage was caused intentionally or through gross negligence by the victim with regard to electricity installations the operating party will be liable for any damage to a person or a thing unless he or she proves that the damage in question is due to force majeure wilful misconduct or gross negligence of a third party or the victim performance mitigation are concepts of force majeure commercial impracticability or frustration or other concepts that would excuse performance during periods of commodity price or supply volatility recognised in your jurisdiction swiss law and swiss courts generally do recognise force majeure in accordance with article 119 paragraph 1 of the co an obligation is deemed extinguished when its performance is made impossible by circumstances not attributable to the obligor however article 119 paragraph 1 of the co generally only applies to events that are completely beyond the control of the concerned party eg in the case of an earthquake a flood etc and only if the performance has become strictly impossible during periods of commodity price or supply volatility it may be that the performance of the obligation becomes more expensive and more time consuming but unless the commodity in question does not exist anymore the debtor always has the possibility to perform as a result article 119 paragraph 1 of the co is not applicable to periods of commodity prices or supply volatility therefore if the parties wish to extend the effects of force majeure to circumstances such as market volatility they may define and draft a clear clause about such considered cause majeure events and the consequences thereof if the parties did not include any mechanism to adapt the contractual provisions to unexpected and substantial market volatility the general principle of clausula rebus sic stantibus may apply accordingly if exceptional circumstances that the parties did not contemplate when entering the contract occur a party may request the courts to adapt the obligation in question to reflect what the parties would have agreed upon in good faith had they known about these exceptional circumstances at the time that they entered into the contract nuisance what are the rules on claims of nuisance to obstruct energy development may operators be subject to nuisance and negligence claims from third parties with regard to the construction and development of the project anyone who is directly affected by an administrative decision such as an authorisation to build a new energy complex and has an interest in the decision being cancelled or modified may appeal the initial decision unless the court specifically orders so the appeal has a suspensive effect and the construction cannot take place from a private law aspect landowners are obliged to refrain from any nuisance detrimental to neighbouring properties in particular all harmful effects that are not justified by the location and character of the land or by local custom such as air pollution emissions of noxious vapours noise vibrations radiation or the deprivation of sunlight or daylight are prohibited if this is not respected then the affected person is entitled to sue the landowner or the plant operator for indemnification or for protection against imminent damage liability and limitations how may parties limit remedies by agreement parties may limit remedies by agreement in particular the law governing the contract for work and services article 363 et seqq co and the agency article 394 et seqq co two recurring forms of contracts in the energy sector are very flexible enabling the parties to a contract to limit or modify remedies however an agreement to waive liability for gross negligence or unlawful intent is null and void if concluded in advance the courts would generally treat the contractual provision in question as excluding liability for negligence and thus reduce the scope of the liability exclusion clause to the extent permitted by law contractual penalties may be included in energy contracts if that is the case the party activating the penalty will only be able to request the execution of the contract or the payment of the penalty unless the parties have contracted differently as to liquidated damages there are no specific regulations under swiss law however they are perfectly admissible and subject to the same judicial review as contractual penalties as per article 163 3 of the co as such grossly inadequate liquidated damages may be reduced at the discretion of the judge is strict liability applicable for damage resulting from any activities in the energy sector there are no specific provisions governing strict liability for the energy sector as a whole instead the relevant act depending on the pursued activity must be considered strict liability of plant operator or electricity providers is to be found in the legislation pertaining to the nuclear and the electricity industries commercial civil law procedural enforcement how do courts in your jurisdiction resolve competing clauses in multiple contracts relating to a single transaction lease licence or concession with respect to choice of forum choice of law or mode of dispute resolution because there is no specific statutory provision governing competing clauses in multiple agreements relating to a single transaction the general principles of contract law apply as a result the starting point is always the common intention of the parties assuming there is an overlap between two competing jurisdiction arbitral or choice of law clauses the courts will seek to establish or alternatively construe the common intention of the parties in this regard it has to be noted that as a matter of principle each contract is to be looked at individually an exception will only be made if the contracts in question appear to all parties as being a bundle of agreements which together form an entity non published decision of the swiss federal supreme court dated 18 december 1991 partly reported in sj 1992 p 562 turning to how the courts resolve such competing clauses the decision of the swiss federal supreme court dated 17 january 2013 4a_244 2012 is to be carefully considered in this case a jurisdictional and an arbitral clause were competing in two distinct contracts the court sought to establish the common intention of the parties and held in this regard that choosing arbitration results in a strong limitation of both parties appeal possibilities thus justifying a strict interpretation of the arbitral clause as a result unless the clear common intention of the parties to resort to arbitration can be established or construed the arbitration clause will not be given effect when competing with a choice of forum clause are stepped and split dispute clauses common are they enforceable under the law of your jurisdiction stepped dispute clauses are rather common in practice and are enforceable under swiss law they are subject to the same validity requirements as regular arbitral clauses ie inter alia written form consent and arbitrability if an arbitral tribunal declares itself competent in violation of a stepped clause eg no satisfactory mediation procedure took place in the run up to arbitration the swiss federal supreme court will examine this violation under article 190 paragraph 2 b of the private international law act pila and may take the appropriate measures in this regard courts will tend to suspend the arbitral procedure and order that a proper mediation be conducted within reasonable time this will be the case if a party to a stepped clause files a notice of arbitration in disregard of the mandatory mediation clause bge 142 iii 296 where a party wrongfully deemed the mediation process a failure and filed a notice of arbitration before the parties had the chance to meet in person which the swiss federal supreme court held for mandatory in connection with the agreed upon icc adr rules split dispute clauses are not as common as stepped clauses but are nonetheless enforceable if considering entering one do bear in mind that particular attention is to be paid to the specific wording thereof because the lis pendens rules in civil litigation in switzerland also apply with regard to arbitral procedures consequently a poorly drafted split clause could lead a state court to hold that the issue brought before it is already part of the ongoing arbitration so that it will dismiss the claim on the ground of lis pendens how is expert evidence used in your courts what are the rules on engagement and use of experts expert evidence is broadly used in courts especially with regard to technical matters there are three means of evidence under the swiss civil procedure code cpc that could qualify as expert evidence expert witness article 175 cpc expert opinion article 183 cpc and arbitrator s opinion article 189 cpc which is not to be confused with the role of an arbitrator sitting on a panel in proceedings based on an arbitration clause the expert witness is subjected to the same rules as regular fact witnesses and in particular article 307 of the swiss criminal code governing perjury an arbitrator s opinion as per article 189 cpc definitely binds the court as to the reported facts whereas a judge may depart from the facts detailed in an expert opinion as per article 183 cpc individuals providing expert or arbitrator opinion are subjected to the same recusal provisions as judges ie strict independence requirements and may be recused if the conditions are met upon one or both parties request a private expert report may be submitted to the court but is considered a means of allegation and not a means of evidence bge 141 iii 433 e 2 6 there is no particular rule on engagement with regard to private expert it being understood that a court will not give it a lot of credit if the expert in question is considered too close to one of the parties what interim and emergency relief may a court in your jurisdiction grant for energy disputes generally speaking a court may take any interim measure suitable to prevent an imminent harm pursuant to article 262 of the cpc there is no exhaustive list of measures and the courts have a broad interpretation leeway in this regard in particular they may issue an injunction to a party to the procedure issue orders to third parties and authorities as well as order a payment or a performance in kind numerous acts do provide for specific interim measures in the electricity sector in particular the competent authority federal electricity commission elcom may grant the interim access to the grid according to article 22 of the electricity supply act what is the enforcement process for foreign judgments and foreign arbitral awards in energy disputes in your jurisdiction there are no specific rules as to the enforcement of foreign judgments and foreign arbitral awards in energy disputes with regard to foreign arbitral awards the new york convention of which switzerland is a signatory party will systematically apply pursuant to article 194 of the pila with regard to foreign judgments a distinction is to be made between judgments from a court of a member of the european union iceland or norway and a judgment from a court of a third country the lugano convention of 30 september 2007 cl contains the same regime as to the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments as the brussels regulation no 44 2001 in particular a foreign judgment falling under the scope of the lugano convention will generally be recognised without particular procedure pursuant to article 33 paragraph 1 of the cl turning to judgments from third countries the applicable rules are contained in articles 25 to 32 of the pila this recognition regime is not as streamlined as in the lugano convention and requires in particular a specific recognition procedure pursuant to article 29 paragraph 1 of the pila please note that switzerland is not a signatory party to the hague convention of 1 february 1971 on the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments in civil and commercial matters alternative dispute resolution are there any arbitration institutions that specifically administer energy disputes in your jurisdiction no there is not it is generally considered that the existing institutions in particular the swiss chambers arbitration institution provide satisfactory solutions for the energy sector however in order to further strengthen switzerland s position as a global litigation stronghold discussions aiming at establishing an international commercial court are currently ongoing in the zurich parliament zurich international commercial court is there any general preference for litigation over arbitration or vice versa in the energy sector in your jurisdiction disputes between state institutions and private parties regarding regulatory matters are subjected to the administrative procedure and will eventually be heard before state courts disputes arising in connection with grid access grid usage grid usage fees and the cost of electricity must first be brought in front of the elcom as a matter of principle disputes between companies and consumers are heard by civil courts as to the commercial disputes in the energy sector in particular with regard to the construction and operation of facilities and plants or supply agreements the individual contracts will often refer to arbitration are statements made in settlement discussions including mediation confidential discoverable or without prejudice in the run up to civil procedures parties to settlement discussions will very often enter a non disclosure agreement thus rendering the content of such discussions confidential however this agreement is only binding upon its parties and will not stand a domestic court order requesting that particular documents including emails or minutes be disclosed under article 160 paragraph 1 b of the cpc the only exception to this disclosure obligation is the attorney client privilege as a result statements made in settlement discussions including mediation that are not covered by the attorney client privilege are confidential but subject to a court disclosing order in procedures with state authorities ie applications for construction permit or grid access statements made towards the competent authorities are subjected to the applicable law on public information and data protection with regard to federal authorities for instance the freedom of information act of 17 december 2004 applies whereas the documented discussions with federal authorities are in principle publically accessible but are rendered anonymous wherever possible prior to inspection privacy and privilege are there any data protection trade secret or other privacy issues for the purposes of e disclosure e discovery in a proceeding there are no specific rules governing e discovery in switzerland in any event all and any data transfer is subjected to data protection legislation trade secret rules and state secrets provisions in particular with regard to e discovery the main issues are in connection to the location of the disclosed data the swiss data protection act provides that personal data may not be disclosed abroad if the privacy of the data subject would be seriously endangered as a result of it this will particularly be the case if the country of destination of the transferred data does not offer sufficient legal data protection in such a case the transfer may generally only occur if the data subject approves of such transfer if contractual safeguards are put in place or if there is a sufficient public interest what are the rules in your jurisdiction regarding attorney client privilege and work product privileges attorney client privilege is governed by article 13 of the federal act on the freedom of movement for lawyers according to this provision a swiss attorney shall keep confidential all and any information regarding all matters brought to him or her as an attorney by his or her client the attorney client privilege is unlimited in time an attorney may be released from this confidentiality obligation by the competent cantonal supervisory body in such a case however the attorney may but must not disclose the information in question in civil procedure with the exception of proceedings against the attorney itself the attorney client privilege may not be lifted not even by the court the same is true for administrative proceedings please note that in house counsels are not considered as being attorneys for lack of mandatory independence hence they do not benefit from the attorney client privilege swiss law does not contain any rule as to work product privilege information and documents gathered in anticipation of litigation are not subject to any other rule than the aforementioned attorney client privilege jurisdiction must some energy disputes as a matter of jurisdiction first be heard before an administrative agency as a matter of principle all disputes regarding regulatory issues in the energy sector between private and a particular state institution must first be heard before the corresponding competent authorities their decisions may then be challenged in front of the courts some exceptions are made for instance in disputes regarding grid access grid usage grid usage fees and the cost of electricity the parties must first refer to the elcom the elcom is an independent administrative body the decision of the elcom may be challenged in front of the administrative federal court the remaining disputes in particular between private parties are subjected to civil litigation procedures in front of ordinary courts or as the case may be arbitration regulatory relevant agencies identify the principal agencies that regulate the energy sector and briefly describe their general jurisdiction at the federal level the department of the environment transport energy and communication is the lead department in charge of the country s energy policy making within this department the swiss federal office of energy sfoe is responsible for the day to day monitoring and implementation of the energy policy the sfoe is responsible for the creation of a sufficient crisis proof broad based economic and sustainable energy supply the sfoe ensures the maintenance of high safety standards in the production transport and utilisation of energy it creates the necessary conditions for efficient electricity and gas markets and an adapted infrastructure it actively promotes efficient energy use an increase in the share of renewable energy and a reduction in co2 emissions it promotes and coordinates national energy research and supports the development of new markets for sustainable energy use and supply access to infrastructure do new entrants to the market have rights to access infrastructure if so may the regulator intervene to facilitate access in switzerland new entrants have a right to access the infrastructure for example the federal law on means of transports by pipelines of combustibles liquid or gaseous fuel stipulates in its article 13 that the exploiting company has to transport on behalf of third parties and within the technical limits and a healthy use of the installation as long as the third party offers an acceptable remuneration in contentious cases between the parties the federal office of energy decides if the exploiting entity has to conclude and enter a contract with the third party and decides on the contractual terms similarly article 13 of the electricity supply act provides that all grid operators must grant access to third parties on a discrimination free basis the elcom is competent in case of a dispute between the grid operator and the third party wishing to access the grid judicial review what is the mechanism for judicial review of decisions relating to the sector taken by administrative agencies and other public bodies are non judicial procedures to challenge the decisions of the energy regulator available when a federal administrative agency or a public body renders a decision said decision usually may be internally challenged in front of the internal appealing body this procedure may be considered non judicial but the parties to the procedure enjoy comparable procedural rights ie right to be heard right to an attorney etc as in front of a judicial instance all decisions may be challenged in front of the administrative federal court usually within 30 days of the decision being handed down the appeal must contain prayers for relief motivation and exhibits relating to the case in certain cases where a decision is handed down by a cantonal authority the appeal must be made at cantonal level and may only be challenged in exceptional circumstances at the federal level cantonal agencies and public bodies cannot form an appeal at the federal level cantonal bodies and public agencies must respect the decision of cantonal courts only a private party may in exceptional circumstances appeal at the federal level fracking what is the legal and regulatory position on hydraulic fracturing in your jurisdiction at the current juncture there is no federal law specifically designed for fracking the authority to rule on the legality of fracking lies mainly within the cantons as fracking is the exploitation of mineral resources the federal government may enact provisions as to regulate this practice ie environmental protection the general position on fracking is quite restrictive three cantons have already adopted motions that suspended any drilling permits that were previously granted and fracking is explicitly forbidden in three other cantons namely geneva bern and zug that being said the federal council unveiled a report on fracking in march 2017 by which it found that the application of the technology should in general be possible under certain conditions and thus saw no reason for a moratorium on fracking other regulatory issues describe any statutory or regulatory protection for indigenous groups there are no indigenous groups in switzerland describe any legal or regulatory barriers to entry for foreign companies looking to participate in energy development in your jurisdiction if a foreign company is looking to enter the market through a submission to a public tender then it will have to abide by the swiss law on public tenders which specifies in its article 4 that offers from foreign companies may be considered provided that said companies are incorporated in a state that has signed the 5 april 1994 agreement on public tender or in other states provided that switzerland has concluded an agreement with them or that switzerland has recognised that these states guarantee equal treatment for swiss companies taking part in public tenders each sector of energy has an administrative body elcom in the case of electricity sfoe and the federal inspectorate of pipeline in the case of liquified natural gas carbura in the case of petroleum that will issue a permit or a licence based on the type of commodity being imported the national supply act the pipeline act the pipeline ordinance the ordinance concerning safety standards for pipelines electricity supply act and the energy act all contain relevant provision regarding the quality and security standards that have to be applied by foreign companies looking to access the swiss market what criminal health and safety and environmental liability do companies in the energy sector most commonly face and what are the associated penalties each law specific to each energy sector typically contains provisions regarding health and safety and the consequences of their breaches usually said consequences are under the form of a criminal liability that is to say an imprisonment sentence and a fine for instance omitting to take safety measures to protect the environment can result in a prison sentence of up to three years other sovereign boundary disputes describe any actual or anticipated sovereign boundary disputes involving your jurisdiction that could affect the energy sector there is no ongoing or anticipated sovereign boundary dispute involving switzerland however other elements affect the energy sector generally speaking switzerland is experiencing a shift away from the use of nuclear energy this trend was confirmed on 21 may 2017 as the swiss voters accepted the energy strategy 2050 developed by the government as a result thereof it is forbidden to build new nuclear plants in switzerland this change of law aims at increasing energy efficiency and further promoting renewable sources of energy consequently wind sunlight and geothermic energies are set to become increasingly popular this trend is reflected in many areas of the legal system such as tax law ie tax incentives for energy improvements public procurement ie promotional subsidies generally attributed to energy efficient projects and the progressive renewal and upgrading of the electricity distribution network energy treaties is your jurisdiction party to the energy charter treaty or any other energy treaty switzerland has been a party to the energy charter treaty since 1998 switzerland has negotiated since 2007 with the eu regarding a bilateral treaty regarding participation in the development of the electricity single market but so far no agreement has been reached apart from bilateral investment treaties or free trade agreements which may have energy implications but are not proper treaties per se there are no further treaties to be mentioned investment protection describe any available measures for protecting investors in the energy industry in your jurisdiction domestic and foreign investors are first and foremost protected by the fundamental right to own property anchored in article 26 of the swiss constitution and according to which any direct or indirect expropriation shall in principle be compensated in full additionally all investors enjoy the right to have access to courts and be heard by them furthermore switzerland is party to over 120 bilateral investment treaties which aim at guaranteeing inter alia equal treatment between domestic and foreign investors in particular in the energy sector foreign investors may rely on the provisions contained in the energy charter treaty cybersecurity describe any legal standards or best practices regarding cybersecurity relevant to the energy industry in your jurisdiction including those related to the applicable standard of care in 2012 the swiss government unveiled its plan to improve cybersecurity with regard to both the country s institutions as well as its entire economy to this end the federal council conducted a trans sectoral risk assessment study to find out which areas were subjected to which levels of cybersecurity risks within the energy sector the oil and electricity supply were listed as highly critical whereas the natural gas supply was listed as very critical as a result the entire energy sector is benefitting from the same kind of security measures as the banking sector telecommunications or water supplies there is no specific statutory obligation to comply with international cybersecurity standards such as the iso iec 27000 series or the isf standard of good practice for information security however switzerland takes an active part in the development of international standards in cybersecurity and the iso iec 27000 series is at the core of the guidelines issued by the federal data protection and information commissioner which is the authority responsible for data surveillance in switzerland the data protection act is set to soon undergo complete revision and during the consultancy process leading up to the draft of the revision proposal a discussion regarding an explicit duty to comply with international data protection standards took place however such duty was not included in the final draft which has yet to be debated in parliament update and trends update and trends list any major developments case law statute or regulation that are anticipated to affect the energy sector in your jurisdiction in the next 12 months including any developments related to the taxation of energy projects what is the anticipated impact of climate change regulations treaties and public opinion on energy disputes first the new energy act entered into force on 1 january 2018 it is a broad piece of legislation aiming at diminishing the country s energy consumption and increasing energy efficiency key new regulations include stricter co2 emission standards for vehicles increased subsidies for energetic restoration and lighter authorisation procedures for renewable energy facilities second the requirements in terms of electricity labelling and certificates of origin for electricity were further strengthened at the beginning of 2018 with certain local industry leaders calling for similar requirements pertaining to foreign gas third a legislative effort aiming at the liberalisation of the electricity market in switzerland is currently pursued by the swiss government if enacted this change could free the electricity retail market from important constraints thereby offering a greater choice to consumers with regard to the choice of the electricity provider and the means of production of electricity finally as part of the country s energy strategy the smart meter rollout started in 2018 thereby further digitalising the electricity market

updated march 12 2019 10 00 am edt maghreb news focus on tunisia and algeria jean r abinader jean r abinader march 12 2019 tunisia struggles to have better economic outcomes in 2019 gains support from the international community across the board most indicators are favorable for 2019 according to information compiled in a recent oxford business group report although the tunisia dinar fell some 22 against the dollar this past year tunisia s 2018 exports rose 19 to 13 4 billion while imports rose some 20 to 19 6 billion resulting in a jump in the trade deficit due largely to rising energy costs and the weakening dinar bright spots continue to be agricultural and processed agricultural products which showed an increase of more than 53 last year while manufacturing exports rose 25 according to the government challenges continue in terms of taming inflation now at 7 1 and unemployment that stayed at 15 throughout last year how tunisia will succeed in combatting inflationary pressures in light of recent increases in the salaries of public sector workers and rising living costs will affect the country s capacity to meet imf commitments to reduce public spending especially on salaries however as the report noted despite concerns over tunisia s ability to rein in public spending curb inflation and reduce the deficit foreign investors have continued to increase their participation in the economy foreign direct investment fdi increased by 28 6 in 2018 led by investments in the agricultural and industrial sectors international organizations are also playing a key role the eu recently announced that it would provide more than 342 million to support economic development and reducing youth unemployment this follows an agreement from saudi arabia to provide a loan 500 million to alleviate pressure on the budget as well as 230 million to finance exports and an additional 100 million for projects the latter agreements were cemented during visits last year by crown prince mohammed bin salman to tunisia followed by a visit to riyadh by tunisian prime minister youssef chahed the international islamic trade finance corporation will provide a loan of 154 million to help offset energy imports and provide capital to the tunisian electricity and gas company this is in addition to a 120 million loan from the african development bank to support budget payments with a more positive outlook for 2019 tunisia should be able to reach a gdp growth of 2 9 this year with an eye on increasing agricultural exports and attracting more fdi algeria continues to roil with uncertainty with postponement of april presidential election it is hard to find news summaries of events on north africa without some commentary and analysis on the postponed april presidential election the announcement early this week that president bouteflika would not run and the election postponed so that a broad consensus about going forward could be achieved is still settling in demonstrations that occurred opposing his candidacy shared four points they were uncharacteristic not the usual not happy with economic or social conditions small gatherings that are a common feature of algeria life they all focused on resistance to president bouteflika standing for a fifth term the demonstrators pointed to both bouteflika s and the complicity of the regime business political and military elites as the problem which is still in place and there were no solutions proposed other than opposing the re election as a sham to maintain the existing power structure another common theme was that the current process is a charade that deprives the algerian people of their dignity and deprives the country of drastic measures needed to curtail corruption and push economic and social reforms now has that changed since the announcement was vague about next steps there are many unanswered questions and taken in conjunction with the news that the prime minister ahmed ouyahia resigned his office to be replaced by the interior minister noureddine bedoui there may be some disarray among the elites the announcement from the algerian press service mentioned that this new republic and this new system will be in the hands of the new generations of algerians who will naturally be the main actors and beneficiaries of public life and sustainable development in the algeria of tomorrow the statement went on second there will be no presidential election on april 18 this is to satisfy a pressing request that many of you have addressed to me to remove any misunderstanding as to the desirability and irreversibility of the generational transmission to which i am committed what this means in concrete terms is yet to emerge one suggestion is to suspend the current government and for a military or a caretaker government to initiate a minimum of reforms to begin a process of economic growth although this may be far fetched as it would involve many who are part of the twin problem of corruption and economic stagnation a third option is that the eu and the us work to develop a coordinated strategy to both influence the power brokers in algeria and close off opportunities for russia and china to increase their already sizeable influence in the country given the current low priority of algeria on the us administration s radar and the disarray in the eu this may end up being too little too late
bill gates elizabeth warren and bernie sanders all want the rich to pay more taxes but gates is saying what the democratic candidates appear to be thinking go for the capital gains rate gates the billionaire co founder of microsoft corp and the world s second richest man has suggested that an increase in the capital gains tax rate is the simplest and most direct way to target america s wealth and tax experts say that s essentially what senators warren and sanders both seeking the 2020 democratic presidential nomination are doing with her wealth tax and his expansion of the estate tax they re just packaging it in a way that s easier to sell on the campaign trail democratic tax proposals are simply a stealth attack on the preferential rate for capital gains said christopher faricy a political science professor focused on tax and inequality at syracuse university before you file your taxes you must read this source of riches the very wealthiest of taxpayers derive the bulk of their riches not from wages or salaries but from capital gains profits on investments in stocks property or other assets unlike labor income which is taxed at a top rate of 37 percent profits on assets held for at least a year before being sold bear a top rate of 20 percent in 2018 nearly 69 percent or more than 584 billion of all long term capital gains went to the top 1 percent of of the 1 1 million wealthiest us filers according to the urban brookings tax policy center the richest americans got the lion s share with the top 0 1 percent of the 110 000 wealthiest filers scoring more than three quarters of that total most of the wealth gap is due to capital gains said mark spiegel who runs a small hedge fund at stanphyl capital management nobody s earning 50 million in labor income warren s ultra millionaire tax plan targets capital gains without saying so and taxes them differently she would require the top 75 000 wealthiest u s households to pay an annual 2 percent levy on each dollar of net worth over 50 million billionaires would pay an additional 1 percent tax over that by going after accumulated wealth at death sanders also targets the fruits of capital gains with his proposal to dramatically expand the estate tax including imposing a new 77 percent rate on the portion of estates worth more than 1 billion his plan would also lower the threshold at which the estate tax kicks in to more than 3 5 million from the current 11 million a level doubled in the gop 2017 tax overhaul and impose a 45 percent rate on estates worth as much as 10 million but going after capital gains has always been politically tricky and hard to sell to the public republicans treat the capital gains tax benefit like it s a tablet from moses said mark mazur director of the tax policy center and a senior treasury official during the obama administration but there s nothing sacred about it democratic plans that target wealth that largely comes from capital gains functionally serve as the equivalent of a higher rate on those profits according to mark bloomfield president and chief executive officer of the american council for capital formation a lobby and research group said andrew hayashi a tax law expert at the university of virginia school of law the spirit of the moment is that people feel like capital income is under taxed the democrats proposals derided as socialism by president donald trump are most likely to remain just campaign rallying cries unless a democrat wins the white house in 2020 and the party gains control of both houses of congress but calls to seize the wealth of the top 1 percent or fewer make for better campaign rallies than calls to raise the rate on capital gains mazur said big fortunes gates for what is believed to be the third time in a decade said in a television interview last month that the big fortunes if your goal is to go after those you have to take the capital gains tax which is far lower at like 20 percent and increase that the revenue he said should be used to plug the budget deficit a different goal from democrats who want to use the revenue raised on federal health and child care programs among other things political fights over capital gains aren t new but earlier battles focused directly on changing the rate itself rather than targeting the fruits of those profits or indexing it for inflation an idea that treasury secretary steven mnuchin and trump briefly floated last year the capital gains rate has fluctuated from a high of nearly 40 percent in the late 1970s to 28 percent after former president ronald reagan s tax cuts of 1986 and has been at the current 20 percent since 2013 gates hasn t gone into detail on how to raise the capital gains rate his 98 5 billion net worth includes the charitable bill melinda gates foundation with nearly 51 billion in endowment assets as of the end of 2017 the foundation is fueled mainly by profits from microsoft stock and dividends through cascade investment his holding company economists debate whether reducing the rate would spur or retard economic growth and charitable giving raising it 5 percentage points to 25 percent would produce less than 25 billion in revenue over a decade through 2027 according to tax policy center estimates meanwhile sanders estimates that his increase on billionaire estates alone would raise up to 2 2 trillion warren s plan would raise 2 75 trillion over 10 years according to her campaign spiegel echoing an argument often heard on wall street said that reducing the benefit would prompt wealthy investors to work less chances are the guy making 10 million a year in capital gains and income is working 80 hours a week and if top incomes bear more tax that guy s not going to work more and instead go hang out on the tennis court or boat all day trump s april 15 deadline tax loophole saves thousands

relations section of our website agrofresh com for reconciliations of non gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures i would now like to turn the call over to jordi ferre jordi jordi ferre chief executive officer thank you jeff and good afternoon everyone please turn to slide 3 for full year 2018 we generated 9 increase in total revenue versus the prior year and reached 67 million in adjusted ebitda 2018 was a transitional year for the company that was focused on creating business diversification as well as implementing initiatives that we believe will bear fruits in 2019 and deliver material improvement in our operating cost structure going forward diversification initiatives into new crops and products represented over one third of our 2018 revenue with revenue outside of apples growing 13 for the full year 2018 this growth was led by tecnidex and its comprehensive portfolio of fungicides coatings and waxes which enjoy accelerated sales in the second half of the year and grew 9 for the full year versus 2017 on a pro forma basis from a geographic mix perspective revenue generated outside north america represented approximately 75 of the company s total revenue europe is the largest region with over 40 of sales and is being driven by the addition of tecnidex citrus business along with increased penetration impaired we also continued to build a very diversified global customer base with our top 10 customers representing only approximately 15 of our revenue collectively these aspects of our diversification strategy help offset a weaker apple crop in the pacific northwest during the fourth quarter as we look toward the future we continue to focus on delivering a more cost efficient operation that will support our growth initiatives which are comprised of organic acquisitions and strategic partnership these growth initiatives will allow us to broaden our product offering and provide us with entries into new geographies both of which we expect to help in our efforts to create further diversification in our business to deliver organic growth we are proud of our regulatory capabilities as an enabler to new product launches and geographic expansion the recent registration approvals for harvista and landspring are examples of the opportunities we continued to create through our registration capability harvista received approval in australia following our global registration strategy for the expansion of this key product landspring just received approval for tomatoes in california which now give us comprehensive coverage of the entire us tomato market the expansion into california opens a market where approximately 80 of us tomatoes are grown today please turn to slide 4 smartfresh revenue saw an overall decline of 14 in the fourth quarter of 2018 versus the prior year period and was down 3 for the full year 2018 smartfresh revenue was essentially flat for the year excluding the impact of foreign exchange and the asc 606 accounting standard for deferred revenue we saw improved dynamics in 2018 in the european apple market with a crop recovery versus last year in germany and belgium and penetration increases in italy france and portugal we also had broader traction in crops outside of apples led by pears the pacific northwest region of the us was negatively affected during the fourth quarter of 2018 by a smaller and earlier apple harvest specifically apple production by our estimates contracted approximately 15 from the pacific northwest for 2018 additionally many of our customers experienced a difficult cherry season due to the current trade dispute with china which coupled with lower than normal yields in apple put additional pressure on pricing and adversely impacted utilization of post harvest solution thanks to our broad global geographic diversification the effects of a weak apple season in the pacific northwest were offset by growth in other market crops and products in fact our pacific northwest smartfresh business today represents less than 10 of the company s total revenue we believe that 2019 will be a better season in that region with new product solutions being introduced and a more aggressive approach to harvista expansion please turn to slide 5 tecnidex contributed 18 million of revenue growth for full year 2018 and serve as a catalyst to change our culture from a one crop one technology company to a more complete post harvest business that includes a broader set of solutions such as fungicides and coatings and provides access and knowhow into the citrus market these additional expertise was particularly impactful since we estimate citrus to represent about 60 of the core global post harvest market as i previously mentioned tecnidex saw solid growth in the second half and we expect this to continue into 2019 diversifying our core business to a broader crop and product base is central to our operating strategy and we saw continued progress on this front in 2018 within our core smartfresh portfolio we continuously increased penetration of the pear market for example in argentina chile the netherlands and belgium pear revenue was up double digits collectively adding approximately 3 million in revenue growth versus the full year 2017 for full year 2018 the proportion of revenues from crops other than apples increased to 30 with the primary drivers being citrus pears bananas avocados cherries plums and melons this compared to just 19 in full year 2017 a regulatory strength is key to expanding the addressable market for our product offerings the most notable approval since our last investor call are first the smartfresh registration in the us was amended to allow core treatment with our actimist foggable fungicide solution this is a key approval especially for the pacific northwest since it will support our service bundling strategy second smartfresh protabs today represents 60 of our total smartfresh revenue we have continued to expand protabs approvals into other crops in europe such as melon peach nectarine apricot pear and kiwifruit we anticipate protabs will continue to increase the shape of smartfresh applications in 2019 as a reminder protabs are under patent protection through 2022 third landspring this is a product applied in the nursery to better manage the spreads of transplanted seedlings into the field we obtained approval in 2016 for introducing tomatoes in the eastern half of the us and have recently extended this approval to california which represents 80 of the total us production opening an approximate 5 million to 6 million addressable market we sell landspring through a third party with limited dedicated internal resources and enjoy attractive gross margins and four we achieve our first sales of smartfresh in india and are running customer trials in anticipation of future approval in that market please turn to slide six harvista is our near harvest synergistic solution that complements smartfresh harvista helps slow respiration and the ripening process while the food is still on the tree promoting fruit firmness and quality for an extended period for the full year 2018 sales of harvista were down 7 driven by the negative factors in the pacific northwest that we have touched on earlier however we strongly believe that we will return to growth in 2019 based on the positive results our customers continue to experience when applying harvista we will couple this with a more aggressive commercial effort that will include the appointment of a pre harvest distributor to expand our acreage reach we also see expanded growth for harvista in other regions and in other crops such as cherries in the united states where successful trials during 2018 indicated an average 10 increase in yield which is significant additionally expanded regulatory approvals for harvista have continued with the additions of blueberries in chile and the recent approval for apples in australia the total addressable global market for blueberries is approximately 120 000 acres and for palm fruits which include apples and pears we estimate the global addressable market is almost 900 000 acres concerning australia apples we estimate it represents an addressable market of 8 million to 10 million please turn to slide 7 tecnidex is regional leader in the post harvest citrus segment that is providing agrofresh crop and technology diversification by an established portfolio of fungicides coatings and waxes expanding into fungicides it is a key driver of product diversification strategy since these product categories currently represents approximately 20 of total post harvest market sales with a high penetration in global citrus and apples in the us tecnidex contributed 21 million of revenue in the full year 2018 and grew 9 on a pro forma basis for full year 2018 the strong performance in the fourth quarter was supported by a fully integrated portfolio and alignment within our sales team we were able to leverage tecnidex s deep expertise and long established relationships with key fungicide producers to launch into cherries in chile and we are planning to expanding apples during 2019 additionally we are planning to initiate pilot sales in 2019 with citrus customers in california and aim to accelerate expansion in 2020 together these collective efforts give us confidence that we will be able to continue to deliver meaningful growth for the tecnidex business in 2019 please turn to slide 8 ripelock is the ideal solution to extend yellow life of bananas another four to six days and reduce shrink for the retailer although still growing from a small base our ripelock revenue more than doubled for the full year 2018 compared to the prior year during 2018 the ripelock solution was used in about 1 800 grocery stores worldwide 700 more than the previous year in 2019 we re expecting further expansion of the number of stores as we enter new markets such as australia in fact we currently have more than 10 ongoing trials with large retailers in the us europe and australia the collaboration with del monte has been key to expanding our pipeline and reach into the us grocery market we have also initiated the strategy to expand ripelock into other crops such as broccoli and avocado and during the second quarter of 2019 we are planning to run test with potential customers both are among the highest growing and more profitable fresh products category we continue to develop our new product pipeline through internal r d and through strategic partnerships we will have more news on these initiatives in due time please turn to slide 9 in july 2018 we officially launched freshcloud our cloud based platform for monitoring product s quality through the supply chain freshcloud provides key data above fruit freshness and health that can be translated into actionable insights that help customers along the fresh product supply chain and maximize their return as data backed solutions become a standard that transforms the post harvest industry we believe agrofresh is in an ideal position to lead this initiative based on our decades long proprietary global data collection and technical expertise we are leveraging our ongoing pagoda collaboration to monitor quality and predict shelf life for fresh fruits including cherries imported into china although freshcloud revenues during 2018 were modest we expect to make progress in 2019 as we continue to expand and build our digital platform i ll now let graham speak to some of the financial highlights graham graham miao chief financial officer thank you jordi and good afternoon to everyone on the call please turn to slide 11 let me review the financial highlights for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2018 beginning with net sales i would like to remind everyone of the geographic seasonality of our sales throughout the year sales in the southern hemisphere are concentrated in the first half of the year and the sales in the northern hemisphere are concentrated in the second half of the year as a result our fourth quarter is positively influenced by our smartfresh franchise in a northern market now turning to the financials net sales for the fourth quarter of 2018 decreased 1 5 from 54 1 million to 53 3 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 despite a decline in north america our business benefited from the global reach and ability to serve customers worldwide europe s core post harvest smartfresh business delivered strong 21 growth year over year as a reminder europe represented 40 of our overall company revenue in 2018 tecnidex a business which we acquired controlling interest in december 2017 to complement our post harvest portfolio generated 7 revenue growth to 7 8 million in the fourth quarter 2018 versus the same period last year as jordi mentioned in his remarks our north america smartfresh business was impacted by several factors in the fourth quarter including a smaller apple crop size and a shorter season that affected both smartfresh and harvista for the full year 2018 net sales increased 9 to 178 8 million the increase was driven by the addition of tecnidex which contributed growth of 18 1 million along with smartfresh growth in europe partially offset by declines in the pacific northwest of the united states due to our ongoing diversification strategy and the addition of tecnidex smartfresh sales in the pacific northwest represented less than 10 of the company s overall revenue in 2018 for the full year tecnidex delivered 20 8 million in revenue representing a solid 9 growth year over year this acquisition has performed well for us and it has expanded our post harvest services to the citrus market we have begun to take advantage of opportunities to leverage the tecnidex products into areas such as the americas where agrofresh already has strong customer relationships now let me add additional color to the net sales drivers as a reminder the 9 revenue growth for the full year included tecnidex total organic sales without tecnidex were approximately 158 million representing a 2 4 decline in the full year 2018 versus 2017 foreign exchange driven by the euro and the impact of deferred revenue from asc 606 had a combined effect of 1 5 reduction in sales excluding the impact of foreign exchange and asc 606 accounting our base business remained essentially flat please turn to slide 12 where we ll discuss margin in the fourth quarter our gross margin was 74 9 and it was consistent with expectations as we execute our strategy of diversifying revenue mix with a broader assortment of product solutions such as tecnidex harvista and the ripelock for the full year 2018 gross profit increased 1 to 132 5 million compared to the full year 2017 gross margins for the full year 2018 decreased to 74 1 from 80 1 in the prior year also reflecting our diversification initiatives strategic pricing in our core business and the impact of asc 606 deferred revenue turning to slide 13 we continue to be focused on cost optimization to create greater efficiency for our business and to better align our operating structure with our revenue base we began to see the results of these initiatives in the fourth quarter of 2018 where operating expenses including r d and sg a decreased 9 to 19 2 million versus the prior year excluding tecnidex which added 3 million operating expenses were down 15 to 17 6 million in the fourth quarter compared to prior year on a full year basis operating expenses increased 5 to 79 6 million driven by the addition of tecnidex excluding tecnidex which contributed 6 4 million operating expense were reduced by 2 5 to 73 2 million for the full year compared to 2017 now let me talk about specific expense items research and development expenses were 3 6 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 down slightly versus the prior year period for the full year 2018 r d expenses was stable compared to the prior year at 13 9 million this included 1 2 million of additional r d expenses related to the citrus programs at tecnidex r d spending reflected our resource allocation strategy that supports initiatives that drive continued diversification beyond apple selling general and administrative expenses including tecnidex were 15 6 million on a reported basis for the fourth quarter down 11 versus prior year excluding tecnidex sg a expenses were 14 7 million down 14 for the full year selling general and administrative expenses including tecnidex were 65 8 million up 6 versus 2017 excluding tecnidex sg a expenses were 60 6 million and down 1 for the year going forward we expect our cost optimization initiatives which began to yield results in the fourth quarter 2018 to generate full year benefits in 2019 please turn to slide 14 net loss was 1 9 million in the fourth quarter versus net income of 23 4 million in the year ago period the decrease was mainly driven by 24 million one time mark to market gain in 2017 related to the tax receivables agreement was down as a result of 2017 us tax reform for the full year 2018 net loss was 30 2 million compared to net income of 23 6 million in 2017 as a reminder last year net income benefited from aforementioned tra mark to market gain gains on foreign exchange of 13 million and 14 million of benefit as a result of a deferred tax evaluation allowance of reversal the current year net loss was driven by the amortization of intangibles of approximately 46 million adjusted ebitda was down 0 9 million to 24 4 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 versus the prior year period for the full year 2018 adjusted ebitda was essentially flat at 67 million the full year number was driven by higher sales offset by the impact of lower gross margin and a higher selling general and administrative expenses related to the tecnidex acquisition turn to slide 15 cash provided by operations was 3 million for the full year 2018 compared to 35 4 million in the prior year period the year over year change was driven by an increase in trade working capital of 17 9 million timing of interest payments on our long term debt year over year interest payments were higher by 15 8 million because we made five payments in 2018 compared to three payments in 2017 along with higher interest rates we also saw higher cash tax payments of 3 7 million related to unrealized foreign currency gains in france in 2018 which will be non recurring these were partially offset by a 4 million cash received from the settlement of an interest rate swap capital expenditures were 4 2 million for the full year 2018 compared to 7 7 million in a year ago period our asset light business model accounts for limited capital expenditures which generally range from 3 to 5 of sales annually beyond operating activities we used 13 9 million to satisfy obligations now 6 1 million for repayment of long term debt 2 2 million for a contractual payment to complete our 75 purchase of tecnidex and 1 6 million related to the verigo acquisition in 2018 from a balance sheet perspective cash as of december 31st 2018 was 34 9 million total debt was 412 9 million with no meaningful maturities until july 2021 our revolver was undrawn as of december 31st 2018 subsequent to the quarter end on january 31st 2019 we signed an agreement to extend our existing revolving credit facility from july 31st 2019 to december 31st 2020 and amended certain financial covenants which increased our ability to access the revolver we believe that 12 5 million amended facility is right sized for our current need and it contains more advantageous terms for us to utilize the facility this new revolver will give us the financial flexibility to meet the company s working capital need and is an important first step in our efforts to optimize our capital structure now i ll turn the call back to jordi for his closing remarks before opening the call to q a jordi ferre chief executive officer thank you graham please turn to slide 16 as i mentioned at the outset 2018 was a transitional year for the company we have refocused the enterprise and sustainable growth and i m confident that we now have the right leadership team in place to meet our goals and look forward to delivering solid results in 2019 during the year we intend to deliver organic net sales growth with a focus on building a more diversified business and expect the cost optimization initiatives that were put in place in 2018 to continue to yield benefits throughout 2019 additionally we are working toward improving the health of our balance sheet to ensure that we can support our long term growth strategies that are necessary to meet our diversification initiatives and with that operator please open the line for questions thank you questions and answers operator at this time we ll be conducting a question and answer session operator instructions our first question comes the line of roger duan from rf lafferty please proceed with your question mr duan your line is live roger duan rf lafferty analyst good afternoon can you guys hear me operator yeah roger duan rf lafferty analyst okay hi jordi hey graham hi so couple of questions first of all it looks like apple production in europe is going to be up substantially this year according to usda forecast can you guys confirm this are you guys seeing this as well and maybe give us a little bit more color on this jordi ferre chief executive officer hi roger jordi here speaking yes i think we mentioned that in the call that the european production apple production was up i think we mentioned specifically some countries in central europe so that definitely is confirmed roger duan rf lafferty analyst yeah yeah because they did mentioned it was something like 40 increase year over year so i just want to confirm the magnitude of the increase okay second can you guys update us on the progress of freshcloud i noticed that you guys attended oppenheimer s blockchain summit maybe talk a little bit more about the blockchain and how is it going to playing your freshcloud offering jordi ferre chief executive officer yes so the freshcloud as we said before is a journey as we build the platform across the whole supply chain in kind of measuring all the information on real time and to be able to make to help our customers make a good decision on predicting shelf life of products et cetera and prioritizing products over others depending on the freshness of the food that is being shipped yes we did attend the blockchain conference and i think that eventually at a certain point once we have a solid platform we could potentially turn these into a blockchain opportunity roger duan rf lafferty analyst all right okay thanks the final question are you guys looking to acquire the rest of the tecnidex seeing the growth provided by this segment jordi ferre chief executive officer we have sort an agreement with the previous owner and i don t think that s public so in due time i guess things can happen but at this point in time at least we refer back to the agreement that we signed which is a private agreement roger duan rf lafferty analyst okay no problem okay graham miao chief financial officer we own larger roger duan rf lafferty analyst go ahead graham graham miao chief financial officer it s graham so we own 75 so can stop that their operations in to our financial statements roger duan rf lafferty analyst okay yeah no problem okay understood thank you so much graham miao chief financial officer thank you operator operator instructions our next question comes from line of gerry sweeney from roth capital please proceed with your question gerard sweeney roth capital partners analyst hey good afternoon jordi and graham thanks for taking my call jordi ferre chief executive officer hi gerry gerard sweeney roth capital partners analyst just a question on tecnidex obviously it s been a good acquisition for you on a few fronts and i think you did touch up on it a little bit in the prepared comments but can you go a little bit further into maybe some of the post harvest citrus market opportunity you re seeing there and then a follow up to that would be maybe some synergies to expect from tecnidex now that it s fully integrated to agrofresh thank you jordi ferre chief executive officer right so in the growth opportunities that we see in citrus is obviously there are two areas one is i think when we combined the name agrofresh with a new offering in citrus i think customers generally speaking because of our name are very receptive to that second the tecnidex has also been playing for a while in certain countries that are going to be growth countries in the citrus business i m talking about the middle east in places like egypt turkey these are places that the company made early bet morocco these are growing markets for citrus the company had made an earlier bet and with the addition of agrofresh we intend to speed up we also have intentions to grow in areas like south africa and in latin america where the company had just started as well to try to introduce their products so i think what we do in agrofresh is two things one is i think combining the name because i think agrofresh has a strong name and a good reputation in the market combined with our resources as well in those markets let s remember that tecnidex was a privately owned company that was trying to expand at their own pace what we ve done is basically we ve put them on a much higher speed to actually achieve this growth opportunities gerard sweeney roth capital partners analyst got it and then what about maybe discussing some of the synergies we expect on a go forward basis now that it s fully integrated anything on that front jordi ferre chief executive officer well there is some synergies that we re working on to capture that will be more related to improving our supply chain that s going to be a very important thing they tecnidex has a strong base in spain which is actually in the valencia area it s a good area to actually try to be integrated in our supply chain and how we move different products not only from them but from us as well in terms of doing some manufacturing in that facility et cetera which will be beneficial to us from a synergy standpoint and obviously we do see a lot of synergies in terms of the sales synergies right and i think we feel that toward the end of the year especially when we had a full impact and we see that continuing as well the acquisition was especially driven by synergies so i want to make sure that s understood gerard sweeney roth capital partners analyst got it okay i appreciate it thank you jordi ferre chief executive officer yeah thank you operator our next question comes from line of james jang from maxim group please proceed with your question james jang maxim group analyst hey good afternoon guys jordi ferre chief executive officer good afternoon how are you graham miao chief financial officer good afternoon james james jang maxim group analyst doing well so just a lot of questions have been answered but as we move toward 2019 so what do you feel as the greatest revenue opportunity you see something happening in ripelock where that could grow exponentially with the partnership to help the top line what do you think is more of diversification and tecnidex helping you get into other sectors that you really don t have strong presence in jordi ferre chief executive officer of course we always would hope that things would take an exponential path i mean there is a possibility obviously all the stars line up in one year that we could actually get through that however i think that would you would see in 19 is the same trend that you see in 18 in terms of our diversification strategies we ll go deeper into the growth of the company i think that some of the hiccups that we ve seen like harvista will be back on track this year and so i think that you will see even with the results you ve seen this year will be improved next year in terms of growth based on the diversification initiatives in terms of having something that could be exponential we re very prudent here i think we take one step at a time and all the steps have to be solid toward that sustainable growth james jang maxim group analyst okay that s fair and with ripelock and everything else have you had any further discussions with larger grocers in the us meaning has there been more of pull factor in terms of your product jordi ferre chief executive officer i think i mentioned in my previous remarks that i disclosed that there were 10 there is more than that but 10 large grocery sales right now going on i think i mentioned that i disclosed it james jang maxim group analyst yeah jordi ferre chief executive officer so yes i think that shows that we re in full activity in doing trials trials sometimes can be at a little bit long because they take a while to prepare a while to roll out and some time also to evaluate results and then there is the time logical for big companies to make decisions to do that so we could so again we re on the right track here based on the pipeline and the number of trials that we have right now james jang maxim group analyst okay great and one last one i know you don t have your exact numbers but what do you think the market opportunity for the cherries in chile could be once they get mature jordi ferre chief executive officer you are referring yourself right now cherries in chile or because we talk about blueberries in chile you re talking about harvista right now am i james jang maxim group analyst no tecnidex jordi ferre chief executive officer i m sorry i m sorry james jang maxim group analyst you can expand it the new jordi ferre chief executive officer yes yes i m sorry i m sorry yes yes so i don t have the exact number how much would that be but i will tell you that the opportunity in the harvista let me put it this way in cherries harvista chile has 35 000 acres of cherries fungicide itself i haven t really assessed the total potential i can tell you is that it s not small we re talking about an opportunity in the millions james jang maxim group analyst okay all right got you all right that s all i had thanks guys jordi ferre chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from line of daniel jester from citigroup global markets please proceed with your question daniel jester citigroup global markets analyst yeah hi good morning good afternoon everyone i wanted to ask you a bit on the your current strategy for smartfresh i think it s my understanding that in 2019 you have more patents for the in calculation technology rolling off in parts of europe parts as asia pacific and also canada so i was wondering if you can just comment about how you may adjust your business now that some more patents are rolling off jordi ferre chief executive officer welcome back dan it s good to have you here so on your question about patents i mean i ve been saying that for a while the main patent expires 2014 that was the used patent and so we ve been public to say that we ve been facing competition ever since the patent you are actually addressing is the encapsulation patent and that is not even today our main application method we have protabs our main application method but i will tell you this and in my experience competition in this market happens when you have providers of service in the post harvest market and so the fact that a patent expires doesn t mean that we re going to have a multiplication of different competitors it means that the competitors that we know and they are in a market and have certain reputation to the service can have access to that those that can be a more serious competitors have had access to that product now in a different application now for three years so although obviously nobody likes to have patents that expire i don t think it s going to be that much of a dramatic correction as some of the people have been assessing graham miao chief financial officer and also dan it s graham it s also important to point out that you mentioned canada and the east coast the united states and then as jordi mentioned that we already using mostly protabs in those regions instead of the powder encapsulation formula that you referred to daniel jester citigroup global markets analyst got you thank you that s very helpful clarification on ripelock in the slide deck you talked about adding 700 stores in the us which by my math added a couple million dollars so i m just wondering what the open opportunity is if you have to add a very large number of stores every year just to get a few million dollars of revenue is there a way to accelerate that is that is this sort of revenue per store low only because you re in the trial phases can you just talk about how you see that ramping up over the next two years jordi ferre chief executive officer yes it s a very good question yes the average store revenue will increase based on two factors number one as you lend bigger stronger grocers that turn more products per store and the stores are larger obviously you re going to have better sales per store so again as you improve your or you re getting larger grocers in to your customer base second yes there is some incidence in terms of trials obviously but generally speaking trials the only thing that they do actually they should measure the same as in real life so i don t think that s the impact the biggest impact really is adding more quality stores and quality grocers to your grocer store ph customers daniel jester citigroup global markets analyst got you and then maybe one last one for graham can you just talk a bit about philosophically how you think about the balance sheet how rapidly do you feel like you need to delever it or are there other tools that you can use to give jordi some more firepower to go acquire some more company thank you jordi ferre chief executive officer thank you as well graham miao chief financial officer yeah sure so the balance sheet capital structure in general improvement has been on our radar screen so as you see that we are very proactive thinking about and also working with our advisors very actively evaluating the opportunities out there in the marketplace so the way we see over the next over time certainly before the maturities so we ve got some time to put that put into action so first and foremost as we announced in january that is the to fix the existing revolver so that s just a first step to make it more user friendly but also extend the maturity by a year and a half so that certainly will give the company opportunity financial flexibility to look at the marketplace our overall capital structure and a debt refinancing opportunity later on so to for overall deleveraging strategy for us with first and foremost that we are focusing on our business internal organic growth as jordi mentioned we have several products that our baseline business is becoming more stable and we also have some growing brands that we re putting resources behind so in addition as you mentioned we are very opportunistically looking at some suitable targets in the marketplace ready to leverage our strong market position globally to tapping those tapping to those opportunities so overall we are active and it s on our radar screen operator and ladies and gentlemen at this time i m showing no further questions i d like to end the question and answer session and turn the conference call back over to management for any closing remarks jordi ferre chief executive officer thank you very much to everybody that attended the call thank you

we regret the outcome of tonight s vote the spokesman said on the eu side we have done all that is possible to reach an agreement it is difficult to see what more we can do with only 17 days left to 29th march today s vote has significantly increased the likelihood of a no deal brexit should there be a uk reasoned request for an extension the eu27 will consider it and decide by unanimity pantheon macroeconomics view our base case remains that mps will agree on a limited extension of around three months and then will force the pm to engage in cross party talks leading to an agreement for a norway style soft brexit in q2 the withdrawal agreement would be unrevised but the political declaration would be overhauled to bring labour mps on side we still see around a 30 chance of a second referendum either called by mrs may or backed by a majority of mps to break the deadlock but believe the chances of another election remain slim shares in europe mostly edged higher ahead of the uk

inflation was soft bolstering the case for the us federal reserve to pause rate hikes in the end the cpi report changes nothing for the fed since it remains consistent with what they already intended

reality is headline measures of inflation are at the mercy of energy prices that is always true using the crude futures strip right now suggests headline inflation is going to hover here around 1 5 over the balance of the year but even casual observers of crude futures know it can change on a moment s notice this is why we find it bothersome the fed has seemingly placed so much emphasis on its

us360 billion in tariffs they ve imposed on each other s imports since july investors have been heartened by signs that trump is looking to sign a deal with chinese leader xi jinping possibly at a summit at trump s mar a lago resort in florida as early as this month currencies lpl on us rates short term rates have settled into a range that aligns with a fed pause the 2 year yield has closed within 10 bps 10 of the upper bound fed funds rate for 31 straight days the longest streak since 2013 however 10 year yields have fallen into their smallest year to date range since 1974 even as market expectations and data point to rising inflation we see the stall in long term rates as a clash between steady economic growth and rising inflation expectations on one hand and higher global demand amid lower yields in other major regions on the other said lpl chief investment strategist john lynch however we think sound economic fundamentals will eventually prevail over global uncertainty lpl on the 10 year yield we expect the 10 year yield to end 2019 in a range of 3 3 25 as growth stabilises and inflationary pressures continue to rise we wouldn t be surprised to see the 2 year yield climb slightly if stronger growth forces the fed to implement one hike in the second half of the year based on our forecast we d expect to see 25 50 bps 25 50 in steepening through the end

damien meyer afp a middle class that outnumbers the combined poor and aristocracy is a relatively new phenomenon dating back to around 1900 the rise of the middle class was the result of industrial revolution capitalism it has been one of the most significant and epochal developments in history yet the intellectual reaction for the most part has been to either ignore it or treat it with disdain now the project to destroy the middle class is well under way with unpredictable and uncontrollable consequences that promise to be just as epochal as its creation intellectual condescension towards the middle class is so common it s a cliché what s rare are attempts to go back in history and see things through the perspectives of that despised group and its progenitors the poor in 1800 virtually everyone was poor living under conditions of deprivation and grinding poverty even being wealthy was no picnic present day poverty line americans live better life expectancy was an estimated twenty nine years farming the occupation of most was dangerous backbreaking labor from dawn to dusk most of those so engaged eked out a tenuous subsistence there was no electricity no running water primitive sanitation and health care and none of the machinery gadgets and appliances we take for granted only a few wealthy poets who didn t have to wrest a living from nature waxed euphoric about its joys as the nineteenth century progressed primitive factories mostly in cities began producing goods of better quality in more quantity and at lower cost than had been possible by artisans handcrafting their wares no doubt conditions in those factories were abysmal long hours pittance pay child labor dangerous and filthy conditions and horrible accidents and injuries all that has been well chronicled and dramatized but an important point gets overlooked bad as they were the factories were a better option for those who worked in them than the farms from whence many of them came or they would have stayed there capitalism requires capital and early industrialization provided profits to capitalize more factories further innovation new inventions and industries and eventually the astonishing burst of dynamic energy that became the industrial revolution each new generation of mines factories ships trains farms and other productive assets became less labor intensive produced higher average real wages had lower percentages of child labor and were less dangerous than their predecessors again by present day standards most working conditions were still abysmal but less so than what had preceded them that was the relevant consideration for the millions of people who worked in dickensian conditions it was their best option and better than anything they had previously known the nineteenth century produced more technological and scientific innovation that all the centuries before it combined societies don t go from poor to rich overnight however real world conditions opportunity income wealth health and overall quality of life steadily improved by 1900 life expectancy in the us was 46 years for males and 48 years for females an unprecedented one century increase sometimes the payoff was huge andrew carnegie really did get off the boat with eleven cents in his pocket cyrus mccormack john d rockefeller thomas edison henry ford and other success stories came from impoverished or modest backgrounds and made multimillion dollar fortunes the self made businessman became the american archetype fueling countless aspirations the emergent middle class was a cohesive force for political stability the immigrants passed their memories of what they had escaped to their children and grandchildren they embraced the reality and the promise of america based on their own fruitful experience life was good and would get even better why rock the boat few noticed the thunderhead on the horizon that thunderhead was hate directed not at america s flaws and weaknesses but at its virtues and strengths the sacrifice hard work thrift and ingenuity that had lifted millions from poverty was condemned as selfishness blind ambition and greed the middle class that didn t exist a century ago was materialistic anti intellectual and spiritually impoverished the unprecedented wealth america was producing was wrong because it was unequally distributed or the most philanthropic and charitable people in history weren t giving enough away you can guess where the hostility came from the intellectuals who found what they peddled commanded little attention or respect and would be rulers in a nation with little desire to be ruled the desire for autonomy to be left alone to be free to make one s own decisions and live one s own life are the benchmarks of well adjusted normalcy the desires to tell or force other people what to do are the opposite wellsprings of hate which are depending on their intensity and quality neurotic sociopathic or psychopathic that the middle class is now fighting for its life reflects two intellectual failures the other failure most average americans simply couldn t comprehend or even conceive of the hatred directed against them statism whatever its variations is never about doing something for people it s about doing something to them even now with virulent vitriol and hatred on full display much of it is minimized or rationalized by people who should know better the corruption of the middle grounders may run deeper than the statists and the collectivists who at least no longer try to hide their agenda and acknowledge that freedom cannot coexist with the unlimited governmental power they covet when somebody claims that your life is their property they re telling you that they have the right to do with it what they will which includes killing you all manner of statist belladonna reached full florescence in the twentieth century socialism communism nazism fascism welfare statism cronyism kleptocracy kakistocracy and the murder genocide and war have been orders of magnitude greater than anything that preceded it you shall know them by their works the thing that statism does best to people is kill them the record is clear and unmistakable anyone now promoting more of the same is simply evil only unmitigated hatred accounts for the particular antipathy directed towards the middle class their values their prosperity and their predominate race white and religion christianity the middle class being a relatively new phenomenon nobody can say what the consequences of the all out war against it will be it is the bedrock of modern economies and its destruction will take out most of the developed world s productive capacity and consumer markets that doesn t seem to bother the statists how they plan to free themselves from the economies that sustain them is a question they ignore it calls to mind ayn rand s atlas shrugged observation the deaths they desire the most are their own that has to be the true definition of insanity truer even than einstein s repeatedly doing the same thing and expecting a different result to this day nobody can explain the logic behind the bailouts during the last financial crisis and what ensued the world s central banks monetizing massive government debt and pushing interest rates below zero the high and mighty pretend this is all normal but for normal people buying a bond with a guaranteed loss is insane microscopic rates force them against their better judgment into a stock market that s crashed twice since the turn of the century decimating their savings and now sits at historically sky high valuations keep spending money you don t have and inevitably you ll go broke keep making promises you can t fulfill and inevitably you ll break them there are hundreds of trillions of dollars worth of claims on the future out there that have no chance of ever being redeemed yet the pile continues to grow the mathematical outcome is as straightforward and devastating as playing russian roulette with all the chambers loaded obamacare is the latest insane gift from the government that keeps on giving it s an obvious failure but it s a foaming at the mouth murderous pit bull that from some deranged concept of mercy or an appalling lack of fortitude nobody will put out of its misery medical care stands in a long line of industries that malevolence masked as good intentions has destroyed a bright middle schooler can see that the green new deal will bring the economy to a shuddering stop and plunge many who have managed to escape so far into poverty yet the democrats leading lights rush to praise the imaginary raiment of would be empress ocasio cortez the middle class has always aspired to better things the american dream talk of 70 percent or higher tax rates and wealth taxes capitalizes on hatred of the rich it s open season why work and sacrifice to get rich if the government gets it all take away middle class dreams and you may well be taking away the last thing that keeps them paying their taxes observing the law supporting the troops and police in short everything that from the vantage point of the ruling class keeps them in line what began as a gentle squeeze a century ago has become python like constriction government has drained economic vitality and shuttered opportunity as the once politically stable prosperous and optimistic middle class dwindles a few still reach the upper echelon but most are consigned to creeping poverty blunting the economic consequences with credit and the personal consequences with cannabis alcohol opioids pornography and promiscuity it s only going to get worse as debt grows massive unfunded medical and pension liabilities come due taxes rise economies shrink and promises are broken the potentates may find their nuclear arsenals and well armed militaries and police forces comforting however their experiment confronts unanswered questions what if a substantial portion of the population has taken to the streets and far outnumbers the praetorians what if praetorian sentiment is with the protestors and insurrectionists are the rulers really prepared to use tanks heavy artillery bombs and even nuclear weapons on their own population will the people charged with pressing those buttons actually press them for america s ruling class failing policies looming insolvency rising awareness via the alternative media their own hypocrisy and corruption political polarization and a well armed populace are a stairway to hell what happens when the disaffected many who will have nothing to lose try to reclaim their lives and liberty and upend the political order that has roadblocked their pursuit of happiness disaffection is a battalion righteous moral certainty an army the latter has moved the world and will do so again it s megatons of tnt the fuze has run and the explosions have started there s no way to predict or control the consequences the only certainty is that anyone who thinks they can do so will be proven disastrously wrong
by catherine rampell washington post writers group fair enough president trump s heartless and whackadoodle budget released on monday will never actually become law even when his party had unified control of government he couldn t get capitol hill to take major portions of his budget terribly seriously still a president s budget plan is a statement of his priorities and based on this latest statement trump s priorities continue to be redistributing wealth ever upward from poor to rich and selling the public more fantasies and lies federal deficits have widened immensely under trump s leadership this is striking not only because he promised fiscal responsibility at one time even pledging to eliminate the national debt within eight years but also because it s a historical anomaly deficits usually narrow when the economy is good and we re not engaged in a major war trump s own policies are to blame for this aberration specifically the 2017 tax law which gave two thirds of its benefits to the top income quintile last year added 1 9 trillion to deficits over the coming decade a grand bargain spending bill last year that increased funding for both defense and nondefense programs here the democrats deserve a share of the blame also spilled plenty of red ink trump s plan for addressing these issues extend the plutocratic tax cuts currently slated to partially expire in 2025 which would add 1 trillion to deficits double down on defense spending increases and money for his border wall and then balance the budget on the backs of the nation s most vulnerable the president s 2020 budget proposal would slash government spending pretty much across the board on entitlements and other nondefense spending that includes programs such as food stamps low income housing assistance and social security disability insurance among the biggest spending categories on the chopping block is health care even though most americans want government to do more to improve access to affordable care not less despite campaign promises to the contrary trump s plan would slash hundred of billions of dollars from medicare over the next decade his budget also endorses enactment of the final and arguably worst affordable care act repeal bill that failed to make it out of the senate in 2017 known as cassidy graham this would lead to sharp cuts to medicaid and the subsidies for insurance purchased on the individual market exchanges the administration would also mandate that all states impose work requirements on medicaid a policy that has been disastrous in the first state to attempt it arkansas last year it resulted in more than 18 000 people getting kicked off benefit rolls with no evidence that it actually promoted work altogether the budget would make poverty deeper and more widespread increase the ranks of the uninsured exacerbate inequality and racial disparities and shrink opportunities for those trying to get ahead said robert greenstein president of the center on budget and policy priorities the trump administration says such tough choices will lead to a balanced budget which it claims it would achieve by 2034 but even that is untrue in fact the only way you end up with anything approximating balanced budgets even beg ital with end ital some of these draconian cuts is by making delusional predictions about economic growth or put another way lying to the american people buried in the new budget is a table with the administration s forecasts for the economy according to the white house we should expect gross domestic product growth of about 3 percent as far as the eye can see unfortunately every independent forecaster or scorekeeper including the congressional budget office federal reserve international monetary fund and legions of private sector analysts says otherwise they all predicted that the u s economy would experience a short term burst of growth from trump s fiscal stimulus in 2018 and possibly for a year or so after eventually alas the sugar high will wear off and we ll return to our longer term trend of about 1 8 to 2 percent annual growth if the track record of recent forecasts is any guide even those estimates may be too optimistic in any case it s no accident that the white house s predictions are so far outside the consensus trump needs to promise magical levels of growth to get his math to work as i ve said before a good rule of thumb is that the more economic growth a politician promises the worse his or her economic proposals probably are now you could argue that the big lessons of this budget that trump cares little about the little guy and appears generally unconstrained by reality are things we already knew still every now and then it is useful to see the president lay it all out so clearly catherine rampell s email address is follow her on twitter crampell c 2019 washington post writers group

march 11 2019 information clearing house president donald trump s administration unveiled its third budget proposal monday cementing a vision for the united states that bolsters funding for defense and border walls while severely cutting social programs for the nation s poorest the 4 7 trillion budget proposal which encompasses everything from funding for food aid education and health care to national defense seeks to slash 845 billion from medicare a program trump notably promised to leave untouched 241 billion from medicaid through major structural reforms as well as a 9 percent cut across non defense programs all while increasing the defense budget to 750 billion 5 percent more than the 2019 budget additionally trump s administration has asked congress for 8 6 billion for the president s border wall a project the president declared a national emergency over earlier this year amid the nation s longest government shutdown in history the proposal also predicts significant economic growth over the next decade at about 3 percent annually with the expectation that the government will continue to enact tax cuts and a deregulatory agenda the projections are far rosier than

dylan scott has explained for vox in the coming weeks lawmakers will have to reach a new deal over budget caps to prevent automatic spending cuts because of a sequestration policy barack obama negotiated with republicans in 2011 the federal debt ceiling a legal cap to how much money the government can borrow was technically breached on march 1 but the treasury department has been able to implement extraordinary measures to buy congress more time with a democrat controlled house and a number of republican senators facing difficult reelection bids next year the white house s budget proposal will likely have a short lifespan in congress but ahead of a 2020 election cycle as democratic presidential candidates continue to unveil proposals to increase taxes on the wealthy to boost the nation s social safety net it s clear trump is offering the opposite vision trump s budget wants to cut the social safety net and build a wall trump s budget proposal has a clear trade off the white house wants to gut the nation s social safety net to give more funding to nation s defense programs and allow for tax cuts primarily benefiting corporations and america s wealthiest the white house is proposing cutting programs like medicare and social security that trump campaigned on protecting and increasing defense and border security spending if trump s budget were to be enacted some of the biggest policy changes would include 1 5 trillion in cuts to medicaid over 10 years implementing work requirements as well as eliminating the medicaid expansion under the affordable care act

trump s administration however has balked at the notion that the decrease in revenue from cutting corporate taxes is the root cause of the growing debt it s not that americans are taxed too little it s that washington spends too much russ vought the office of management and budget s deputy director penned in a fox news op ed monday the trump administration is predicting the economy will continue growing really fast a core part of trump s budget is the assumption that the economy will continue to grow and rapidly while the congressional budget office predicts growth will sit between 1 6 and 1 8 percent over the next decade and the federal reserve settled around 2 percent annual growth the trump administration says growth will surpass 3 percent this year then level out at around 2 8 percent by 2029 this administration has always put forward rosy economic projections that have defied economic consensus the white house will point out that the economy has exceeded outside forecasts so far in 2017 the white house budget projected 2 3 percent growth and it actually reached 2 5 percent in the fourth quarter compared to the previous year last year the trump administration expected the economy to grow 3 1 percent which as vox s dylan matthews wrote last year far outpaced predictions from private sector forecasters they estimated growth closer to 2 15 percent and the congressional budget office projected growth at 1 4 to 1 9 percent between government issued numbers and wall street forecasters the economy grew between 2 9 and 3 1 percent in 2018 essentially line with the trump administration s projections that said revenue has drastically dropped in 2018 the federal government s revenue was only up 0 4 percent one of the lowest growth rates in half a century according to the committee for a responsible federal budget a bipartisan group that advocates for fiscal responsibility the slow revenue rate was in large part due to the tax bill taking inflation into account federal revenues were actually down between 4 to 9 percent this year because of the tax cuts is any of this trump budget going to actually happen trump s budgets haven t come close to being enacted by congress in the past two years top ranking democrats in charge of the budgeting process have already panned the request the house budget committee chair rep john yarmuth d ky called the proposal irresponsible and a cynical vision for our country and rep nita lowey d ny who leads the house s powerful appropriations committee strongly implied the proposal would be ignored altogether president trump has somehow managed to produce a budget request even more untethered from reality than his past two lowey said in a statement with such misguided priorities the trump budget has no chance of garnering the necessary bipartisan support to become law i am committed to working with my colleagues both democrats and republicans to write appropriations bills that responsibly fund the government those seeking the 2020 democratic presidential nomination have also criticized the proposal the trump budget is breathtaking in its degree of cruelty and filled with broken promises sen bernie sanders i vt said this would hurt our seniors and is yet another piece of evidence for why we need a new president sen kamala harris d ca said congress has to negotiate a budget caps deal in the coming weeks to avoid across the board cuts to both defense and non defense programs something both republicans and democrats want to avoid trump s proposal establishes a very conservative starting position the past year has shown trump is willing to play hardball on government spending the president partially shut down the federal government for more than a month at the start of 2019 over less than 2 billion in border security funding then again going into a presidential election cycle fighting for serious cuts to medicare and social security both programs trump promised to never touch among other programs would be a bold and risky political position this article was originally published by vox
president donald trump proposed a record 4 7 trillion federal budget for 2020 on monday relying on optimistic 3 1 percent economic growth projections alongside accounting shuffles and steep domestic cuts to bring future spending into promised balance in 15 years the deficit is projected to hit 1 1 trillion in the 2020 fiscal year the highest in a decade the administration is counting on robust growth including from the republican tax cuts which trump wants to make permanent to push down the red ink some economists though say the bump from the tax cuts is waning and they project slower growth in coming years the national debt is 22 trillion even with his own projections trump s budget would not come into balance for a decade and a half rather than the traditional hope of balancing in 10 still trump contended the nation is experiencing an economic miracle he said in a letter to congress accompanying the plan that the country s next step must be turbocharging the industries of the future and establishing a new standard of living for the 21st century presidential budgets tend to be seen as aspirational blueprints rarely becoming enacted policy and trump s proposal for the new fiscal year which begins oct 1 sets up a showdown with congress over priorities including his push for 8 6 billion to build the u s mexico border wall titled a budget for a better america promises kept taxpayers first trump s proposal embodies fiscal responsibility said russ vought the acting director of the office of management and budget despite the large projected deficits vought said the administration has prioritized reining in reckless washington spending and shows we can return to fiscal sanity the budget calls the approach maganomics after the president s make america great again campaign slogan some fiscal watchdogs though panned the effort as more piling on of debt by trump with no course correction in sight maya macguineas president of the committee for a responsible federal budget said trump relies on far too many accounting gimmicks and fantasy assumptions and puts forward far too few actual solutions she warned the debt load will lead to slower income growth and stalled opportunities for americans perhaps most notably among spending proposals trump is reviving his border wall fight fresh off the longest government shutdown in history his 2020 plan shows he is eager to confront congress again over the wall trump s budget proposes increasing defense spending to 750 billion and building the new space force as a military branch while reducing nondefense accounts by 5 percent with cuts recommended to economic safety net programs used by many americans the 2 7 trillion in proposed spending cuts over the decade is higher than any administration in history they say the budget imposes work requirements for those receiving food stamps and other government aid as part of the cutbacks the department of housing and urban development faces a 16 percent cut and for education a 12 percent reduction trump s budget would re open two health care battles he lost in his first year in office repealing obamacare and limiting future federal spending on medicaid for low income people under the budget both programs would be turned over to the states starting in 2021 the plan sticks to budget caps that both parties have routinely broken in recent years to stay within the caps the budget shifts a portion of the defense spending some 165 billion to an overseas contingency fund which some fiscal hawks will view as an accounting gimmick conservatives railed for years against deficits that rose during the first years of barack obama s administration as tax revenue plummeted and spending increased during the great recession but even with republican control of congress during the first two years of the trump administration deficits were on a steady march upward the top democrat on the appropriation committee sen patrick leahy of vermont said the budget is not a serious proposal by refusing to raise the budget caps trump is signaling a fight ahead the president has resisted big bipartisan budget deals that break the caps threatening to veto one last year but congress will need to find agreement on spending levels to avoid another federal shutdown in the fall the democratic chairman of the house budget committee rep john yarmuth of kentucky called the proposed cuts to essential services dangerous he said trump added nearly 2 trillion to deficits with the gop s tax cuts for the wealthy and large corporations and now it appears his budget asks the american people to pay the price the democrat said while pushing down spending in some areas including the environmental protection agency the proposal will seek to increase funding in others to align with the president s priorities according to one official the administration would boost veterans affairs funding by 6 5 billion or 7 5 percent and says reducing veteran suicides would be a top priority the budget provides 291 million to defeat the hiv aids epidemic with hopes of eliminating 90 percent of new infections within 10 years it would also increase resources to fight the opioid epidemic with money for prevention treatment research and recovery the administration said it provides 500 million in new spending over the decade on child cancer research the proposal will also include 1 billion for a child care fund that would seek to improve access to care for underserved populations a white house official confirmed the one time allocation is championed by the president s daughter ivanka trump who has focused on economic advancement for women in her role as a white house adviser it also provides 200 billion toward infrastructure much lower than the 1 trillion plan trump once envisioned the plan says that money would be leveraged with private dollars but congress has largely panned that approach white house economic adviser larry kudlow said trump s budget points a steady glide path toward lower spending and borrowing as a share of the nation s economy he also told fox news sunday there was no reason to obsess about deficits and expressed confidence that economic growth would top 3 percent in 2019 and beyond others have predicted lower growth the border wall remains a signature issue for the president and is poised to stay at the forefront of his agenda even though congress has resisted giving him more money for it leading democrats immediately rejected the proposal congress refused to fund his wall and he was forced to admit defeat and reopen the government the same thing will repeat itself if he tries this again said house speaker nancy pelosi d calif and senate democratic leader chuck schumer of new york they said the money would be better spent on rebuilding america in seeking 8 6 billion for more than 300 miles of new border wall the budget request would more than double the 8 1 billion already potentially available to the president for the wall after he declared a national emergency at the border last month in order to circumvent congress although there s no guarantee he ll be able to use that money if he faces a legal challenge as is expected along with border wall money the proposed budget will also increase funding to increase the manpower of immigration and customs enforcement officers and customs and border patrol at a time when many democrats are calling for cuts or even the elimination of those areas the budget also proposes policy changes to end sanctuary cities the administration said the budget arrives as the senate readies to vote this week to terminate trump s national emergency declaration the democratic led house already did so and a handful of republican senators uneasy over what they see as an overreach of executive power are expected to join senate democrats in following suit congress appears to have enough votes to reject trump s declaration but not enough to overturn a veto the standoff over the wall led to a 35 day partial government shutdown the longest in u s history the wall with mexico played a big part in trump s campaign for the white house and it s expected to again be featured in his 2020 re election effort he used to say mexico would pay for it but mexico has refused to do so

we didn t know it at the time but 10 years ago this week things started looking up on march 9 2009 the s p 500 closed at 676 53 the lowest point it hit over the course of the great recession today the index stands at around 2750 although the implosion of the subprime real estate market is most frequently cited as the catalyst for the recession that historic downturn actually was the result of a perfect storm of economic occurrences said dan north chief economist at euler hermes north america you had a bust in an asset bubble an inverted yield curve and an oil price spike he told nbc news on top of that a sudden unavailability of liquidity froze banking activities and precipitated a global financial crisis the federal reserve responded with the extraordinary steps of dropping the benchmark interest rate to 0 percent and embarking on quantitative easing programs that would eventually grow its balance sheet to 4 5 trillion both steps were radical ones calculated to pour money into the economy and jump start lending in addition to monetary policy congress passed a number of stimulus programs aimed at helping people dealing with foreclosures and job losses the first step in all this was arresting the decline with government programs that tried to take the position of the lender of last resort and basically trying to step in when private capital was too fearful said sameer samana senior global market strategist for the wells fargo investment institute there s kind of an inherent tendency for economies to recover said bruce mccain chief investment strategist for key private bank but the economy of late 2008 needed an extra push to get that momentum going at the early stage the monetary backstopping the federal reserve provided during the crisis was crucial it s less clear that the stimulus they ve provided since then has been effective for the economy as opposed to the market mccain said although the recession was officially over in june 2009 just three months after the stock market hit its trough many ordinary americans remained in dire financial straits consumers have been the key to growth said mark zandi chief economist of moody s analytics and until that spending rebounded the rest of the recovery remained muted too the missing ingredient jobs i think the tricky part is that main street is largely dependent on employment prospects samana said when businesses are uncertain about the future they re very reluctant to add additional workers he said it took an unprecedented six years before the record 9 million jobs that vanished in the recession reemerged north said we went through the slowest recovery since world war ii he said a lot of that may have been that people just stayed on the sidelines aided by expanded unemployment insurance and frustrated by employers who would only commit to filling jobs on a part time or temporary basis now a decade after the market trough unemployment is at a historic low and wage growth is managing to keep abreast of inflation albeit barely financial industry reforms and improved confidence among business leaders as well as consumers have lent stability to the nation s economic growth we re in a better place than we were 10 years ago zandi said the changes post crisis will make it less likely that we ll have the booms and the busts the banking system for example holds a lot more capital that makes it safer the system has much more liquidity than it did pre crisis we ve certainly come a long way with respect to the overall outlook of businesses and investors mccain said economic expansion for much of the recovery was muted but mccain suggests that this pace might have ultimately been critical for the longevity of our current growth cycle it s been a difficult time getting to here but when you have slower growth you can have growth for a longer period of time he said there s nothing inherently that says this cycle for the u s in particular has to end any time soon

lisa mascaro ap congressional correspondent washington president donald trump proposed a record 4 7 trillion federal budget for 2020 on monday relying on optimistic 3 1 percent economic growth projections alongside accounting shuffles and steep domestic cuts to bring future spending into promised balance in 15 years the deficit is projected to hit 1 1 trillion in the 2020 fiscal year the highest in a decade the administration is counting on robust growth including from the republican tax cuts which trump wants to make permanent to push down the red ink some economists though say the bump from the tax cuts is waning and they project slower growth in coming years the national debt is 22 trillion even with his own projections trump s budget would not come into balance for a decade and a half rather than the traditional hope of balancing in 10 still trump contended the nation is experiencing an economic miracle he said in a letter to congress accompanying the plan that the country s next step must be turbocharging the industries of the future and establishing a new standard of living for the 21st century presidential budgets tend to be seen as aspirational blueprints rarely becoming enacted policy and trump s proposal for the new fiscal year which begins oct 1 sets up a showdown with congress over priorities including his push for 8 6 billion to build the u s mexico border wall titled a budget for a better america promises kept taxpayers first trump s proposal embodies fiscal responsibility said russ vought the acting director of the office of management and budget despite the large projected deficits vought said the administration has prioritized reining in reckless washington spending and shows we can return to fiscal sanity the budget calls the approach maganomics after the president s make america great again campaign slogan some fiscal watchdogs though panned the effort as more piling on of debt by trump with no course correction in sight maya macguineas president of the committee for a responsible federal budget said trump relies on far too many accounting gimmicks and fantasy assumptions and puts forward far too few actual solutions she warned the debt load will lead to slower income growth and stalled opportunities for americans perhaps most notably among spending proposals trump is reviving his border wall fight fresh off the longest government shutdown in history his 2020 plan shows he is eager to confront congress again over the wall trump s budget proposes increasing defense spending to 750 billion and building the new space force as a military branch while reducing nondefense accounts by 5 percent with cuts recommended to economic safety net programs used by many americans the 2 7 trillion in proposed spending cuts over the decade is higher than any administration in history they say the budget imposes work requirements for those receiving food stamps and other government aid as part of the cutbacks the department of housing and urban development faces a 16 percent cut and for education a 12 percent reduction trump s budget would re open two health care battles he lost in his first year in office repealing obamacare and limiting future federal spending on medicaid for low income people under the budget both programs would be turned over to the states starting in 2021 the plan sticks to budget caps that both parties have routinely broken in recent years to stay within the caps the budget shifts a portion of the defense spending some 165 billion to an overseas contingency fund which some fiscal hawks will view as an accounting gimmick conservatives railed for years against deficits that rose during the first years of barack obama s administration as tax revenue plummeted and spending increased during the great recession but even with republican control of congress during the first two years of the trump administration deficits were on a steady march upward the top democrat on the appropriation committee sen patrick leahy of vermont said the budget is not a serious proposal by refusing to raise the budget caps trump is signaling a fight ahead the president has resisted big bipartisan budget deals that break the caps threatening to veto one last year but congress will need to find agreement on spending levels to avoid another federal shutdown in the fall the democratic chairman of the house budget committee rep john yarmuth of kentucky called the proposed cuts to essential services dangerous he said trump added nearly 2 trillion to deficits with the gop s tax cuts for the wealthy and large corporations and now it appears his budget asks the american people to pay the price the democrat said while pushing down spending in some areas including the environmental protection agency the proposal will seek to increase funding in others to align with the president s priorities according to one official the administration would boost veterans affairs funding by 6 5 billion or 7 5 percent and says reducing veteran suicides would be a top priority the budget provides 291 million to defeat the hiv aids epidemic with hopes of eliminating 90 percent of new infections within 10 years it would also increase resources to fight the opioid epidemic with money for prevention treatment research and recovery the administration said it provides 500 million in new spending over the decade on child cancer research the proposal will also include 1 billion for a child care fund that would seek to improve access to care for underserved populations a white house official confirmed the one time allocation is championed by the president s daughter ivanka trump who has focused on economic advancement for women in her role as a white house adviser it also provides 200 billion toward infrastructure much lower than the 1 trillion plan trump once envisioned the plan says that money would be leveraged with private dollars but congress has largely panned that approach white house economic adviser larry kudlow said trump s budget points a steady glide path toward lower spending and borrowing as a share of the nation s economy he also told fox news sunday there was no reason to obsess about deficits and expressed confidence that economic growth would top 3 percent in 2019 and beyond others have predicted lower growth the border wall remains a signature issue for the president and is poised to stay at the forefront of his agenda even though congress has resisted giving him more money for it leading democrats immediately rejected the proposal congress refused to fund his wall and he was forced to admit defeat and reopen the government the same thing will repeat itself if he tries this again said house speaker nancy pelosi d calif and senate democratic leader chuck schumer of new york they said the money would be better spent on rebuilding america in seeking 8 6 billion for more than 300 miles of new border wall the budget request would more than double the 8 1 billion already potentially available to the president for the wall after he declared a national emergency at the border last month in order to circumvent congress although there s no guarantee he ll be able to use that money if he faces a legal challenge as is expected along with border wall money the proposed budget will also increase funding to increase the manpower of immigration and customs enforcement officers and customs and border patrol at a time when many democrats are calling for cuts or even the elimination of those areas the budget also proposes policy changes to end sanctuary cities the administration said the budget arrives as the senate readies to vote this week to terminate trump s national emergency declaration the democratic led house already did so and a handful of republican senators uneasy over what they see as an overreach of executive power are expected to join senate democrats in following suit congress appears to have enough votes to reject trump s declaration but not enough to overturn a veto the standoff over the wall led to a 35 day partial government shutdown the longest in u s history the wall with mexico played a big part in trump s campaign for the white house and it s expected to again be featured in his 2020 re election effort he used to say mexico would pay for it but mexico has refused to do so ___ associated

fourth quarter of 2018 which was 8 0 million or 1 8 lower than net sales of 436 7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 the decrease was primarily due to the sale of the company s mill in ladysmith

quarter 2018 segment performance consumer products net sales in the consumer products segment were 212 7 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 down 9 3 compared to fourth quarter 2017 net sales of 234 7 million this decrease was due to lower retail volumes and prices and the divestiture of the ladysmith wisconsin mill in august 2018 operating loss for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 193 6 million compared to operating income and margin of 7 5 million and 3 2 respectively in the fourth quarter of 2017 the operating loss included the non cash impairment charge described above that was

0 4 for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 11 5 million and 4 9 of adjusted operating income and margin respectively for the same period in 2017 adjusted ebitda for the segment was 15 7 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 down from 25 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 those decreases were primarily due to lower average selling prices unfavorable absorption of fixed costs over lower volumes of retail shipments higher pulp costs and the divestiture of the company s ladysmith wisconsin mill tissue sales volumes and prices total tissue volumes sold were 80 980 tons in the fourth quarter of 2018 a decrease of 7 3 compared to 87 313 tons in the fourth quarter of 2017 converted product cases shipped were 11 6 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 8 2 lower than the 12 7 million cases shipped in the fourth quarter of 2017 average tissue net selling prices decreased 1 4 to 2 627 per ton in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 2 663 per ton in the fourth quarter of 2017 pulp and paperboard net sales in the pulp and paperboard segment were 216 0 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 up 6 9 compared to fourth quarter 2017 net sales of 202 1 million the increase was due to record shipment volumes and higher paperboard prices operating income and margin for the fourth quarter of 2018 were 31 8 million and 14 7 compared to 34 4 million and 17 0 respectively for the fourth quarter of 2017 adjusted ebitda for the segment was 41 5 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 44 2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 the decrease was primarily due to higher wood fiber costs due to weather conditions boiler maintenance higher natural gas prices caused by a pipeline disruption which impacted the company s lewiston idaho mill and a pulp disruption at the idaho mill which necessitated a higher volume of purchased pulp paperboard sales volumes and prices paperboard sales volumes were 218 322 tons in the fourth quarter of 2018 an increase of 3 9 compared to 210 098 tons in the fourth quarter of 2017 paperboard net selling prices increased 2 1 to 982 per ton for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 962 per ton in the fourth quarter of 2017 taxes the company s consolidated gaap tax rate and adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2018 were provisions of 2 4 and 37 9 respectively compared to a benefit of 333 2 and a provision of 39 9 respectively in the fourth quarter of 2017 on a gaap basis the net change to our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2018 was primarily the result of recognizing benefits related to tax reform in 2017 and the goodwill impairment expense which did not have a corresponding tax impact the company expects its gaap and adjusted tax rate for 2019 to be approximately 25 note regarding use of non gaap financial measures in this press release the company presents certain non gaap financial information for the fourth quarters and full years of 2018 and 2017 including adjusted net earnings adjusted net earnings per diluted share ebitda adjusted ebitda adjusted operating income adjusted operating margin and adjusted income tax rate provision and benefit because these amounts are not in accordance with gaap reconciliations to net loss earnings net loss earnings per diluted share operating loss income and income tax rate provision and benefit as determined in accordance with gaap are

politics government 2019 elections guide brian godlewski tinley park trustee get to know your candidates for the april 2 election brian godlewski is an independent candidate running for tinley park trustee brian godlewski tinley park il patch asked all candidates running for elected office in the april 2 2019 municipal elections to participate in our voters guide all submissions are voluntary those whose names are not listed chose not to respond or did not respond to requests for information responses are edited for style or space only get to know your candidates name brian godlewski age 43 position sought village of tinley park trustee party affiliation independent family wife dawn two boys and two dogs education i have a bachelor s degree in political science from loyola university of chicago and a master s degree in urban planning and public policy from the university of illinois at chicago occupation real estate broker previous or current elected or appointed offices i have nearly two decades experience in the real estate industry working in commercial and government real estate as well brokerage i have a background in urban planning and economic development campaign website names and offices of all family members who work in politics or government none the most pressing issue facing our board district etc is _______ and what i intend to do about it redevelopment of the mental health center the plan proposed by the developer is boring and uninspiring in my opinion i have big concerns about the financing strategy as well as the environmental remediation and developer selection with the right vision this can be the premier development in the southwest suburbs i proposed my own plan which you can see the video on my facebook page the main themes of my plan are think regional recreational entertainment use and use 365 days year there s an opportunity for new housing but not as much as 800 homes proposed by the village and developer we should also think about what is missing in the southwest suburbs that we can bring to tinley park i proposed an atrium connected to two residential buildings we have large and small music venues but what about something in between like bub city in rosemont which is a restaurant with music stage no doubt this would be a hit in tinley park and we can leverage our relationship with livenation who manages the amphitheater to bring in musical acts to this venue i received many positive comments favoring an indoor turf field and ice arena i would love to see a bike path that connects the site to downtown and 80th avenue all these developments would promote wellness enhance community engagement and increase our tax base substantially what are the key differences between you and the other candidates seeking this post the other candidates have no significant relevant experience and have very vague and a lack of well defined campaign ideas i am serious about this position and spent many hours preparing reading through agreements ordinances meeting and exchanging emails with the village finance staff and economic development manager i have a master s degree in urban planning and policy from the university of illinois at chicago and spent many years in analytical roles in the real industry so i believe my background is well suited for this position i created a detailed platform which you can read about on my facebook page as you consider who to vote for think about where the candidates spent their time this election season hosting fundraisers begging donors for money designing t shirts and logos or seriously preparing to be a trustee explain your attitudes toward fiscal policy government spending and how taxpayer dollars should be handled by your office or board i will answer the question by talking about what happened at the convention center and oak park avenue tif last year the tif expired releasing a lot of property tax revenue from the tif account back the village s general fund guess what the money was already spent before we could get our hands on it was there ever any talk about giving it back to the taxpayers the new owner of the hotel and manager of the convention center got a huge tax abatement from the village and the schools where s the tax abatement for the citizens of tinley park the revenue from the oak park avenue tif was being used to pay the debt service on the general obligation bonds but with the tif expiring tinley park needed a new revenue source the solution was to increase the hotel tax to help pay for the 4 9 million of bonds outstanding at the expiration of the tif so what looks to be a positive event closing out one of the most successful tifs in illinois getting a new hotel and convention center manager actually turns out to be higher taxes big subsidies for businesses and the taxpayers on the hook for paying off bonds there is so much wrong with this scenario many bad fiscal decisions that i want to reverse does anyone in the village ever think about how to lower taxes instead of always raising them we need someone who understands these complex financial issues can connect the dots and expose bad decisions by our village most importantly we need someone with the skills and background to make good fiscal decisions i think that person is me in what way have current officeholders of the position you re running for failed the community how would you do better they make so many bad public policy decisions that cost us millions of we need more knowledgeable people running our local government to make decisions that benefit us in the short term as well as the long term we are off to a bad start on the redevelopment of the mental health center ballooning marketing budget with no major increase in sales tax revenue hundreds of new apartments coming online with no focus on home ownership not leveraging the economic power of our regional assets convention center and amphitheater and the list goes on i recommended ways on how to address many of these problems describe the other issues that define your campaign platform government transparency i want to see regular reporting on the activities of the marketing and economic development departments as well as the performance of the convention center to hold our government accountable more effective marketing we need to redirect our marketing dollars from sort of passive marketing to more active marketing to directly help our businesses larger social media presence we need a much bigger and more effective social media presence part of our marketing budget includes social media and the results no of page likes and video views is poor housing we need to focus more on home ownership both on the supply side with more construction and demand side by partnering with the lending community to promote down payment assistance programs available to first time home buyers veterans and repeat buyers if you win this position how would you define your term in office as a success success would be 1 making good public policy decisions 2 having citizens believe their local government is doing a good job and 3 informing citizens we just have to get back on track and make decisions that benefit us in the short term as well as the long term if you go to a board meeting you see many residents express their frustrations and disappointment with our village government and i want people to feel confident about the direction our government is taking us we also need to keep citizens better informed about meetings proposed development projects and helping citizens better understand these complex topics like tif the annual budget and environmental remediation so they can be empowered please share with voters a story about wisdom gained from a mistake you made in your life or career a mistake i made was underestimating the nastiness and viciousness of politics the one tinley park group tried to kick all the independent candidates off the ballot they failed miserably in the end but it created a lot of extra work and stress for the independent candidates the bashing and cyber bullying of political candidates on social media is unbelievable and out of control i have sure gained a lot of wisdom in the last 60 days about politics and running a campaign why should voters trust you i am spending my own time and money to get elected simply because i think our government needs more qualified individuals to help guide decisions and move tinley park in the right direction i am not in this to return favors to campaign donors because i don t have any as a member of the community group challenging the residence of brookside glen apartment development i put in over 100 hours of my own personal time helping the group although i didn t live right by the development site and my home wasn t immediately impacted i wanted to help the community for some of the same reasons i want to be a trustee because i feel i can help our village work better for the people which accomplishments do you cite as evidence you can handle this job i have worked previously in state government working on a single family rehab program i then managed another program including creating the policies and procedures and then implemented the program it was successful and what i really focused on was finding a good balance between meeting all regulatory requirements and making the program easy for the participants so it could be a success for everyone in the government sector a program might look good on paper but fails miserably because of all the red tape making it difficult to execute my goal with that project and as a trustee if elected would be to make our government work effectively for citizens and businesses what else would you like voters to know about yourself and your positions i live in tinley park with my wife two boys and two dogs i am an independent candidate and my direct link is to the people of tinley park i don t have to check in with a political party boss before voting i feel that political parties have too much control over our local government and trading one slate of candidates for another gets you the same bad result political parties always frame the issue as my party vs your party we all know this type of fighting gets us nowhere i look at it differently it s me vs bad public policy i don t care what party you are from if the decision is good for tinley park then i am on your side if it s a bad decision then i will be against you

this is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated washington president donald trump delivered a 2020 budget to the democratic controlled house on monday that cuts spending nearly across the board yet still isn t projected to balance for 15 years even with ambitious economic growth forecasts the 4 7 trillion budget proposal is dead on arrival in congress but it will stand as a statement of the president s priorities for cutting and spending alike and has already quickly become a lightning rod for democratic criticism fresh off trump s border fight with congress his budget blueprint calls for congress to spend 8 6 billion more on a us mexico wall proposes deep non defense spending cuts and calls for a continued surge in defense spending the president also wants congress to replenish a military construction fund he plans to raid to build the border wall after he declared a national emergency with the 2020 campaign on the horizon the blueprint gives trump a chance to tout his attempt to fund conservative priorities and deliver deep cuts to domestic spending programs that would be popular with his political base alongside a 5 boost to defense spending the plan calls for 2 7 trillion in cuts to federal spending by slashing the budgets for a host of federal departments and agencies including the environmental protection agency department of education and state department among others even as the proposal gives trump a chance to stake out his political priorities it is also opening him up to criticism for faltering on campaign promises trump made a 2016 campaign promise to eliminate the national debt while in office but the budget proposal projects the national debt will balloon to 31 trillion in 10 years and despite trump s promise not to touch social security or medicare his latest budget proposal would reduce medicare spending by 845 billion over 10 years broad strokes few details the initial rollout lacks details on individual programs which are anticipated to be delivered later this month but it sets the stage for the president s priorities heading into his re election campaign including immigration and national security in its proposal the white house is calling for a cut to the overall level of non defense spending by 5 next year below current federal spending caps a nearly 30 billion reduction it would also increase military spending by 5 to 750 billion up from 716 billion the trump administration is using a war contingency fund as a maneuver to get around the defense budget limit which lawmakers have already derided as a budget gimmick though the plan comes with a built in deficit of more than 22 trillion trump administration officials described it as a return to fiscal sanity that won t hinder economic growth the president s proposal would expand the federal budget deficit to 1 1 trillion in the next fiscal year while also calling for balancing the budget by 2034 by assuming the economy will be able to grow faster than most economists anticipate the latest budget aims to balance the budget in 15 years rather than the traditional 10 the administration put the blame on congress for ignoring proposed cuts last year which has resulted in delaying when balance can be achieved in its updated forecast the administration is projecting that the nation s debt will balloon to more than 31 trillion in the next decade by 2029 it currently stands at more than 22 trillion president trump s budget takes steps in the right direction but there is still much work to do said steve womack a republican from arkansas who sits on the house budget committee the white house forecast in its budget that the economy will grow at an average of 3 each year over the next decade including 3 2 in 2019 it also anticipates the economy to gradually slow to 3 1 in 2020 3 in 2021 and 2 8 in 2026 while such forecasts are difficult to predict the white house figure is at odds with projections made by the international monetary fund the imf anticipates us growth to decline to 2 5 this year and soften further to 1 8 in 2020 as the fiscal stimulus of the republican backed tax cuts fade no chance say democrats house democrats have already panned the proposal saying it would leave the country less safe and secure president trump s budget once again lays out an irresponsible and cynical vision for our country without any regard for its human cost kentucky democrat john yarmuth chairman of the house budget committee said in a statement house speaker nancy pelosi of california and senate minority leader chuck schumer of new york said on sunday they would block efforts by trump to get 8 6 billion to build his wall president trump hurt millions of americans and caused widespread chaos when he recklessly shut down the government to try to get his expensive and ineffective wall which he promised would be paid for by mexico they said in a joint statement we hope he learned his lesson on monday pelosi released a second statement deriding the budget as written for the special interests and the wealthiest 1 after adding 2 trillion to the deficit with the gop tax scam for the rich president trump wants to ransack as much as 2 trillion from medicare and medicaid she said while demanding billions more for his wasteful ineffective wall president trump will steal from students and hungry families from rural communities and american farmers from clean air and clean water and from vital job creating investments nationwide as in previous years trump s blueprint also calls for 200 billion for infrastructure spending with the trump administration open to working with congress to construct a package that could attract bipartisan support trump s budget proposal includes funds for hiring across federal agencies including us customs and border protection and the justice department executive office for immigration review both of which have already had trouble filling vacancies that includes 314 million to hire an additional 1 000 ice law enforcement officers the administration is also asking congress for 40 billion to fund the state department s work on international diplomacy and aid in fiscal 2020 a slight increase from last year s request but nowhere close to addressing deep cuts made in 2017 the trump administration s emphasis on funding the pentagon over diplomacy has alarmed retired military leaders who said sunday that squeezing the state department budget undermines us security and leadership the military alone cannot keep our nation safe more than a dozen former combatant commanders including retired generals david petraeus and anthony zinni and retired admiral james stavridis said in a statement urging congress to protect funding for the state department 38 907192 77 036871
