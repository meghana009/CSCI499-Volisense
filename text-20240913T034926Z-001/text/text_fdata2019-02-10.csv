according to legend the person who unraveled the gordian knot would rule the world no one succeeded until alexandar the great took his mighty sword and sliced the knot in half a young boy saw him afterward crying on the steps of the temple of apollo why are you crying the boy asked you just conquered the world yes alexander wept now there is nothing else for me to do investors are not as cursed as alexander the great but what challenges investors now are not new problems but unresolved old ones the uk house of commons vote that was expected next week now looks to be pushed out another week reports indicate that prime minister may brought nothing new with her request that the backstop is renegotiated the backstop is in case there is no better agreement struck there cannot have an expiry without giving the uk incentive to obstruct until it then the uk has been unrealistic from the get go the irish border makes the gordian knot look like a cat s cradle the uk seemed to think that the eu would sacrifice irish interests to ensure an orderly departure though it is not remarked on much it is nonetheless remarkable that the ec has not wavered on this the uk was never a member of the schengen area and it had more control over its own borders than it chose to exercise the politicos have an easy whipping boy in brussels uk officials say that after brexit they can enter into free trade agreements with other countries but it is not like the eu is standing still on february 1 the eu japan free trade agreement went into effect the eu has free trade agreements with australia new zealand vietnam mexico canada mercosur and singapore the size of the eu market gives it negotiating power in trade talks the uk gdp is about 2 6 trillion to say it does not have the eu s heft is to state the obvious but to suggest that the uk can strike just as favorable agreements seems naive at best and disingenuous at worst the irish border issue cannot be resolved all of the stakeholders say the customs border cannot be between the republic of ireland and northern ireland the democratic union party from northern ireland that allows the tories to govern after losing its majority insists that the border cannot be between northern ireland and the rest of britain the non binding referendum in 2016 instructed parliament to leave the eu now it turns out there is no majority in parliament for any particular way arguably the house of commons needs more instructions from the people and postponing article 50 until after another referendum is one scenario however it was a very close decision last time and some irregularities there is some risk that the remainers would win despite the mess of brexit labour continues to trail behind the tories in opinion polls labour leader corbyn has been unable to broaden his party s appeal but he did offer another way to prime minister may he made five demands in exchange for labour s support one of them was staying in the customs union which would resolve the knotty problem of the irish border may is not ready for that yet she sides with those tories that believe that staying in the customs union is not a sufficient exit samuel johnson said that when a man knows he will be hanged in a fortnight it concentrates his mind wonderfully the march 29 departure is more than a fortnight away the minds are not sufficiently concentrated hope seems to decay at the square root of time and as the zero hour is approached and alternative exits are blocked the choice may come down to a no deal exit and a later softer divorce trade is another issue that must go to the brink what white house economic adviser called the varsity team of mnuchin and lighthizer are in beijing next week to continue high level trade talks ahead of the early march deadline reports suggest that while china is willing to talk about a wider range of us demands its position has not changed much from the start it is willing to buy more us goods and reduce or eliminate the trade imbalance it has already begun opening up more of its markets to foreign businesses it has adopted more stringent protections of intellectual property rights china cannot commit to the kind of structural reforms the us demands it has pursued policies in direct contradiction of the imf and washington consensus and it has literally lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty the us wants the chinese state to withdraw from the economy while there is an intuitive appeal the closer it is examined the less insightful it becomes imagine chinese officials demand that the us government withdraws from the housing market where through its ownership of fannie mae and freddie mac it nationalized america s mortgage lending imagine chinese officials complained when the us injected capital into all the large banks whether they asked for it or not if the size of the state is measured as expenditures as a percentage of gdp than it is the us state that is the outlier for how small it is rather than the size of the chinese state many critics see the us government as having encroached on the markets to an unprecedented extent and now the us is insisting the chinese state withdraws it is an unrealistic demand that is tantamount to unilateral disarmament moreover the us has this knack for turning a necessity into a universal virtue in the 1980s when the free trade administration thought it knew better than the markets it coordinated intervention in the foreign exchange market it has now successfully championed the g7 and g20 to formally recognize and endorse markets determining exchange rates it was reported last week that trump and xi are unlikely to meet by the end of the month schedule conflicts were cited but it is understood as confirming kudlow s assessment that the two sides are still far apart in addition to substantive issues a key criticism of past agreements by many in the trump administration lies with a lack of sufficiently robust enforcement trust but verify makes more sense when you can see the deployment of missiles with satellites it is infinitely more difficult with these issues also us officials have been critical of existing adjudication and conflict resolution mechanisms but have not yet offered a politically realistic alternative the us administrations rhetoric does not match its action after lambasting nafta as the worst agreement ever the trump administration has submitted a new treaty for approval that is very similar to the older one modernized with what had been negotiated under tpp trans pacific partnership from which trump withdrew and more robust domestic content requirements the trade agreement with south korea is not too dissimilar either if such a pattern prevails it will imply that after all the drama when everything is said and done the us china relationship is not going to change very much china will reduce the bilateral trade imbalance with the us leave aside the fact that this managed trade may be challenged by others at the wto it is in china s interest to de claw american protectionism in the recent past the protectionists argued china was taking unfair advantage by maintaining an undervalued exchange rate now many models show the yuan near fair value now the protectionist blame other chinese practices some of which do not violate wto rules the us will not be able to convince a majority to change the rules because at least in part the same brush that paints china would tar many others the larger the technology gap the greater the incentive to close it americans are quite willing to see it as a moral issue though when they were on the weak side of the technology gap say in the second half of the 19th century in steel production they too resorted to extralegal methods often china does not have to steal intellectual property rights because foreign businesses agree under the terms of securing large lucrative contracts this one of the things that alstom pa and siemens de whose marriage was rejected by european authorities reportedly have in common for example as part of conditions for over 1 bln in orders each was required to transfer technology to the chinese state owned rail car manufacturer which is now the world s largest train maker for more than 20 years before trump took office there were regular high level meetings between us and chinese officials the trump administration ended the practice would it be surprising to see the talks resume for the first time ever the long term rivalry between the us and china will not be resolved here and now contingent advantage is sought here and now given the trump administration s apparent sensitivity to the stock market performance we suspect the tariff freeze will be extended as talks are said to continue to make progress and perhaps around the middle of the year a deal is struck that reduces the bilateral imbalance and establishes some structure for talks negotiations besides brexit and trade a third issue that will remain unresolved in the days ahead is the state of the global economy the synchronized expansion of 2017 had two legacies the first was that collectively the central banks would reduce their balance sheet expansion and by early 2019 it would turn to contraction the second was that by the end of 2018 there was concern about a synchronized downturn we submit the situation is more complicated the reduction of boj purchases is because it complemented its qe with yield curve control it needs to buy fewer bonds to achieve the same results the jgb yields about minus three basis points about the least in two years some observers argued last year that the ecb was the only source of demand for some peripheral european bonds this has proved wide of the mark demand for sovereign paper in the opening weeks of the year has been strong including for italian bonds the 10 year yield slipped below 10 bp to a two year low the curve is negative out for nine years we expect the ecb will resist through offsetting mechanisms the premature shrinking of its balance sheet from banks paying back loans under the previous targeted long term refinancing operations the us economy surged to over 4 annualized growth in the middle of last year as the fiscal stimulus kicked in but it was always understood to be unsustainable for the world s biggest economy 2 5 growth is expected in q4 18 that is still above trend and is stronger than most of the high income countries growth in q1 19 will take a hit from the record long government shutdown the cold snap and the weakness quirk in the first part of the year that is common even if not fully explicable since the great financial crisis the us reports december households splurged in november when retail sales excluding autos gasoline and building materials jumped by 0 9 a still strong 0 4 gain is expected in december if so it would be the strongest in three months for in seven years january and manufacturing production may have ground to a halt in january but the early data for february like the index is expected to rebound meanwhile headline january was likely dragged lower by the drop in prices but the is likely to remain firm a little above 2 the world s second largest economy restarts after the week long celebration of the lunar new year given that it is the most important trading partner for some many countries chinese and figures are closely watched china s is poised to narrow sharply in january chinese always attract attention a small increase in reserves might not translate into more treasury holdings but it would lend support to ideas that the downside pressure on the currency eased in january when the rose above 2 6 against the dollar low and readings would play on fears of deflationary impulses and a disappointingly weak report could spur speculation of a rate cut or a reduction in the required reserve ratios data from europe will not shed much fresh light however data last week gives the first hints that germany has worked through its auto issue the flash readings are due february 21 and some improvement is looking likely the uk has a full slate of economic reports including q4 the bloomberg consensus calls for a 0 3 quarterly pace for 1 4 year over year which would match the 2018 average and make for the weakest year since 2009 s contraction the gdp data will take the bite from the december data which clears the deck for the january data it includes flat and a small rise is expected after a large drop in december lastly japan will report q4 the world s third largest economy contracted by 0 6 in q3 18 largely due to natural disasters while there is no doubt the economy recovered in q4 it probably was not economy to offset the decline the median forecast is for the japanese economy to have expanded by 0 4 in q4 as both consumption and investment rebounded disappointingly the gdp deflator may have slipped further to 0 4 from 0 3

pleased with our earnings results avista utilities and ael p had earnings that were above our expectations we are initiating our 2019 earnings guidance with a consolidated range of 2 78 to 2 98 per

corp s statutory tax rate federal and state combined of 23 05 percent see item h below for further discussion of our effective tax rate b electric utility margin operating revenues less resource costs decreased for both the fourth quarter and full year primarily due to the following a decrease in electric revenue related to the federal income tax law changes the above decrease was partially offset by increases in retail electric rates due to general rate increases in idaho and washington customer growth which contributed additional retail electric revenue during 2018 and the pre tax benefit under the energy recovery mechanism erm in washington decreased from a 1 0 million pre tax benefit for the fourth quarter of 2017 to a 0 5 million pre tax benefit for the fourth quarter of 2018 the pre tax benefit increased from 4 6 million for the full year 2017 to 6 1 million for the full year 2018 c natural gas utility margin operating revenues less resource costs decreased for both the fourth quarter and full year primarily due to the following a decrease in natural gas revenue related to the federal income tax law changes the above decrease was partially offset by general rate increases in washington idaho and oregon and customer growth which contributed additional retail natural gas revenue in 2018 d other operating expenses decreased for the fourth quarter of 2018 but increased for the full year 2018 for the fourth quarter of 2018 the decrease was primarily due to decreases in transmission and distribution operating and maintenance costs primarily related to the timing of expenses for the full year 2018 there were increases in generation and distribution operating costs e transaction costs were 1 1 million pre tax for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 6 6 million pre tax for the fourth quarter of 2017 transaction costs for the full year 2018 were 3 7 million pre tax compared to 14 6 million pre tax for the full year 2017 the transaction costs decreased for the fourth quarter and full year because 2018 consisted primarily of employee time incurred directly related to the transaction whereas 2017 included consulting banking fees legal fees and employee time none of the transaction costs are being passed through to customers f depreciation and amortization increased for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 due to additions to utility plant g interest expense increased for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 due to additional outstanding debt during 2018 as compared to 2017 h during the fourth quarter of 2018 our effective tax rate was 15 8 percent compared to 53 1 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017 and it was 16 0 percent for the full year 2018 compared to 41 7 percent for 2017 the effective tax rate decreased during 2018 primarily due to federal income tax law changes which were enacted during the fourth quarter of 2017 which lowered the federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent additionally during the fourth quarter of 2017 due to the federal tax law changes we revalued deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new federal income tax rate which resulted in a 10 2 million adjustment to income tax expense in 2017 of this income tax expense amount 7 5 million related to avista utilities and 2 7 million related to our other businesses reflected in j below i ael p earnings decreased slightly for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 primarily due to an increase in depreciation and amortization and other miscellaneous expenses as well as a decrease in sales volumes to residential and commercial customers primarily during the fourth quarter of 2018 j losses at our other businesses decreased during 2018 as 2017 included a one time tax expense in the fourth quarter from revaluing deferred taxes to the new tax rate of 21 percent as a result of federal income tax law changes this was partially offset by increased expenses associated with a renovation project in 2018 impairment losses and an increase in equity method losses on our investments non generally accepted accounting principles non gaap financial measures the tables above and below include electric utility margin and natural gas utility margin two financial measures that are considered non gaap financial measures generally a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s financial performance financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap which for utility margin is utility operating revenues the presentation of electric utility margin and natural gas utility margin is intended to enhance the understanding of operating performance we use these measures internally and believe they provide useful information to investors in their analysis of how changes in loads due to weather economic or other conditions rates supply costs and other factors impact our results of operations changes in loads as well as power and natural gas supply costs are generally deferred and recovered from customers through regulatory accounting mechanisms accordingly the analysis of utility margin generally excludes most of the change in revenue resulting from these regulatory mechanisms we present electric and natural gas utility margin separately below for avista utilities since each business has different cost sources cost recovery mechanisms and jurisdictions so we believe that separate analysis is beneficial these measures are not intended to replace utility operating revenues as determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of operating performance reconciliations of operating revenues to utility margin are set forth below the following

statutory tax rate federal and state combined of 23 05 percent liquidity and capital resources 2018 liquidity transactions we have a 400 million committed line of credit that expires in april 2021 as of dec 31 2018 we had 199 million of available liquidity under this committed line of credit we also had 25 million of available liquidity under ael p s committed line of credit that expires in november 2019 during 2018 we issued 375 million of long term debt in the form of first mortgage bonds 2019 liquidity expectations in january 2019 we received the 103 million termination fee from hydro one for the purpose of reimbursing our transaction costs including the related income taxes of 51 million incurred from 2017 to 2019 the balance of the termination fee will be used for general corporate purposes and reduces our need for external financing after consideration of the net termination fee received from hydro one in 2019 we expect to issue approximately 165 million of long term debt and up to 50 million of equity in order to refinance maturing long term debt fund planned capital expenditures and maintain an appropriate capital structure capital expenditures avista utilities capital expenditures were 419 million for 2018 and we expect avista utilities capital expenditures to be about 405 million for 2019 ael p s capital expenditures were 6 million for 2018 and we expect ael p s capital expenditures to be approximately 9 million for 2019 in addition we expect to invest about 19 million at our other businesses in 2019 this is mainly related to economic development projects in our service territory that will showcase the latest energy and environmental building innovations and house several local college degree programs 2019 earnings guidance and outlook avista corp is initiating its 2019 guidance for consolidated earnings to be in the range of 2 78 to 2 98 per diluted share which includes 1 01 per diluted share for the termination fee received from hydro one and the payment of remaining transaction costs due in part to the on going regulatory proceedings for the hydro one transaction we elected not to file any general rate cases during 2018 so the commissions could focus on the merger proceedings while we received a base rate increase effective january 1 2019 in idaho which was related to a rate plan approved by the idaho public utilities commission in 2017 we have not received base rate relief in oregon since november 1 2017 and have not received base rate relief in washington since may 1 2018 during 2017 and 2018 we continued to invest in our utility infrastructure to maintain and enhance our system however only limited portions of these costs are reflected in our current rates to customers as such we will experience regulatory lag during the period 2019 through 2021 due to the delay in general rate case filings and our continued investment in utility infrastructure we plan to file general rate cases in washington idaho and oregon during the first half of 2019 with requested effective dates in early 2020 to begin remedying the regulatory lag going forward we will continue to strive to reduce the regulatory timing lag and more closely align our earned returns with those authorized by 2022 to achieve this we anticipate an earnings growth rate of 9 percent to 10 percent from 2020 to 2022 and then our normal 4 percent to 5 percent growth rate following 2022 this assumes timely and appropriate rate relief in our jurisdictions our 2019 earnings guidance range encompasses unrecovered structural costs estimated to reduce the return on equity by approximately 90 basis points in addition our 2019 guidance range includes regulatory timing lag estimated to reduce the return on equity by approximately 105 basis points this results in an expected return on equity for avista utilities of approximately 7 5 percent in 2019 we expect avista utilities to contribute in the range of 2 72 to 2 86 per diluted share for 2019 this includes 1 01 per diluted share for the termination fee received from hydro one and the payment of remaining transaction costs the midpoint of our avista utilities guidance range does not include any expense or benefit under the erm our current expectation for the erm is a benefit position within the 90 percent customer 10 percent company sharing band which is expected to add approximately 0 07 per diluted share our outlook for avista utilities assumes among other variables normal precipitation temperatures and hydroelectric generation for the year for 2019 we expect ael p to contribute in the range of 0 09 to 0 13 per diluted share our outlook for ael p assumes among other variables normal precipitation and hydroelectric generation for the year we expect the other businesses to be between a loss of 0 03 and a loss of 0 01 per diluted share which includes costs associated with exploring strategic opportunities our guidance generally includes only normal operating conditions and does not include unusual items such as settlement transactions or acquisitions dispositions until the effects are known and certain note we will host a conference call with financial analysts and investors on feb 8 2019 at 10 30 a m et to discuss this news release the call will be available at 888 771 4371 confirmation number 48122392 a simultaneous webcast of the

it s a disaster it s as bad as any economy i ve seen source no end in sight for zimbabwe s economic woes moneyweb nompu siziba the zimbabwean economy is in dire straits inflation has started ratcheting up again with levels of 50 now being bandied about it s said that over 80 of zimbabweans are unemployed while public servants are poorly paid people s incomes are not rising in line with inflation and this is having serious socioeconomic impacts on that society zimbabwe s president emmerson mnangagwa was out in europe looking for aid it s not clear what he managed to secure in the meantime his finance minister says his reform programme is on track and zimbabwe will recover in due course well to break down the zimbabwe story i m joined on the line by veteran freelance journalist barry d wood who has been covering that country for over three decades barry thanks very much for joining us what s happening on the ground in zimbabwe in terms of food availability on the shelves and affordability and did the fuel price increase earlier this year dramatically reduce demand for it and those long snaking queues barry wood hello nompu it s a delight to talk to you i think the answer to your question is that it s a disaster it s as bad as any economy i ve seen you asked about food yes there is some availability but the people don t have enough money to purchase it you ve had a 67 increase in the food price today there are shortages of bread in harare and in bulawayo that is a real problem you had a few questions there why don t you repeat one of the key ones and i ll address that nompu siziba yes i think you ve answered all of them there is food availability you say but people can t afford it they don t have enough money the third question was really around the fuel price the extent to which that has contracted demand in that economy barry wood yes that s very important because just about two and a half weeks ago we had this more than doubling in the fuel price and that was indeed intended both to produce revenue for the government in excise tax and to alleviate the fuel queues which it did they had stretched on for kilometres causing great frustration that had its intended effect in terms of getting rid of the queues mainly because people could not afford to buy fuel so you are finding people having to pay more to ride the minibuses and they are having to park their cars because they don t have enough money to buy fuel and indeed there are still people coming across from botswana from mozambique from south africa to fill up their tanks because they use the black market rate for the currency and then use that to buy fuel that is cheaper than it is at home so it s an awful mess nompu siziba we know that zimbabwe has been suffering from liquidity issues for a long time what essentially has been the basic problem and what role have technology services like econet played in helping to overcome the issue barry wood let me talk about the econet for just a moment and talk about the problem of currency you don t have monetary stability anybody whether a family an individual or a company requires stability so they can make plans and use their money if they have some sensibly listeners will know that in 2008 9 the zimbabwe currency imploded so that it had the world s highest rate of hyperinflation hyperinflation is defined as inflation of more than 50 a month read zimbabwe inflation hits 50 as zanu pf big wigs milk crisis so they went to the us dollar now that might have been a mistake because the dollar went up in value that priced zimbabwean exports out of its export market then about three or four years ago they introduced this bond note business the bond note was introduced at 1 1 it wasn t called the zimbabwean dollar because the zimbabwean people knew enough about the previous zimbabwean dollar they wouldn t use it well the bond note held its value for a while but now it s no longer 1 1 it is 4 1 then you have this rather ridiculous system called rtgs which is real time gross settlement that is a financial account a bank transfer so you could say that zimbabwe has three monies and people have to scramble to try to make sense of it you mentioned liquidity nompu indeed there aren t enough us dollars because they have a trade deficit they have a fiscal deficit and the bond notes have collapsed in value nompu siziba finance minister mthuli ncube has a reform programme in place with some supporting it saying zimbabwe will have to go through the necessary pain in the short term some of the pain that you ve just described what is the reform programme all about and at what juncture does it seek to resolve the foreign exchange problem barry wood right if you go back to the coup against robert mugabe november 17 people were so hopeful and you suddenly had a lot of freedom that you didn t have under mugabe people were hopeful of a better life when ncube was brought in he s an eminent economist highly respected he has taught at wits he has been the chief economist at the african development bank people had high hopes for him but people i talk to in harare are very disappointed he spends too much time on twitter he has had great difficulty in making the transition from being an academic economist to a policy maker yes he has a reform programme he wants a new money but of course saying so caused people to think hold it the new money is coming this bond note must be really worthless so that caused the bond note to go down even further what is his programme he wants to open the economy he can t open the economy unless he has financial reserves to back up the new currency that he says will be introduced in 2019 you can t get international support as long as people are being beaten in the street and killed for protesting this is the conundrum this is why no one nompu is optimistic in the short term about the zimbabwean economy nompu siziba that was going to be my next question about the crackdown and the violence and even the deaths we heard that at least 12 people died following the protest when the fuel price increases were announced obviously that is not going to augur well for confidence among the likes of the imf the international monetary fund are they really going to put their money with a regime which is still brutalising its people you ve addressed that i guess so is there any optimism on your part after president mnangagwa invited members of the opposition to meet with him today to map out a framework read zimbabwe president invites opposition leaders for talks barry wood that s a nice first step a very good first step but i m afraid the crisis has reached such a proportion that there is more required there probably has to be a national government of some sort you see ncube is not going to be able to make these reforms work let alone bring in any currency unless he has international monetary support coming to him in real hard currency that may not be used but if it s there it communicates to the people that there is going to be monetary stability well the problem is the americans who have a veto power in the international monetary fund have a list of sanctions against individuals including the president and the vice president and the crackdown which you mentioned and i ve been on the phone to harare today there s been more crackdown and a brutal beating of a demonstrator the army and the police you could say are really brutal at this present moment so there is no prospect of an international monetary fund loan there is no prospect of anything more i come to your question about econet which is run by strive masiyiwa who is in exile an expatriate zimbabwean based in london and by the way he is feared by the government and the government doesn t like him he keeps the economy going with econet and ecocash meaning that if you ve got a liquidity crisis and of course zimbabweans do you can put some kind of credit on your phone and buy things on your phone it s a brilliant system and it has worked but it s only a band aid nompu siziba barry time has caught up with us but thank you very much for the insight we are going to speak to you more often in the year to catch up on what s going on in zimbabwe we are very very grateful take care barry wood it s my pleasure
development economist and former deputy governor of central bank of nigeria cbn in charge of economic policy dr obadiah mailafia is opposed to the federal government s plan to privatise the ajaokuta steel company limited located in kogi state mailafia a career banker and international development specialist with over 25 years told assistant business editor mathias okwe why he s opposed to the plan and the compelling need for the country to court the friendship of country s like south korea in order to revive the comatose steel complex ten firms are already expressing interest and offering bids for the ajaokuta steel company limited ascl given the place and importance of steel to economic development and considering the massive investment so far in the project do you think this is the way to go the entire ajaokuta steel company limited saga is a reflection of the tragedy of our national development policy as a whole i have been keenly interested in the steel sector since the early 1980s when i started working as fellow of the national institute of policy and strategic studies nipss kuru near jos i know that steel is a strategic sector for any growing economy forming part of the commanding heights of any strong economy in august 2016 the muhammadu buhari administration effected the re nationalisation of ascl through a renegotiation of the subsisting contract between the federal government and global steel holdings limited gshl vice president yemi osinbajo announced the outcomes of the negotiations between the federal government and ghsl under which ajaokuta reverts to the government while ghsl retains the nigerian iron mining company niomco at itakpe under the new terms brokered by an international arbitrator phillip howell richardson niomco will fulfill its undertakings to guarantee priority supply of iron ore to ajaokuta our government will take home a higher concession of three per cent of turnover instead of the earlier negotiated three per cent from niomco some of us hailed government s action as being patriotic but i am not normally a great fan of re nationalisation this is chiefly on account of the wrong signals it could send to investors but on this occasion i applauded the government s move the logic was unassailable several years of misunderstanding between ghsl and the government had virtually hampered the development of our national steel industry after investing billions of dollars in ajaokuta there s hardly anything to show for it but the olusegun obasanjo led administration went ahead to sell off the steel complex and the aladja iron ore outfit to gshl owned by an anglo indian billionaire whose sharp business practices have become increasingly notorious so for me instead of privatisation we should be looking to source for the 400 million to complete the project under the planned sale of ascl the minister of state for mines and steel development abubakar bwari hinted that preference would be given to indigenous operators do you see any local investor possessing the required technical and financial competence to operate such massive economic assets successfully without compromise i do not know how people reason we tried privatisation before and it didn t work so why must we try the same thing again albert einstein famously noted that the highest mark of insanity is for someone to continue doing the same thing while expecting to get a different outcome the last owner of the complex was a foreign company and it set out cannibalising the company s assets with no plan whatsoever to revive the firm handing over the firm to a local operator would be worse let us recall the facts among multinationals the mittal group which bought ajaokuta scores rather low on the scale of ethical business practices their activities in post war liberia in post communist eastern europe and wherever else their suspect iron fingers have been involved have left a rather bitter taste we in nigeria were apparently too daft to know as we later discovered to our discomfiture they had set upon the cannibalisation of the steel complex carting it off to their new plant in kazakhstan an even more fantastically corrupt country than ours they were only stopped by the courage and patriotism of the host communities in kogi state as the villagers boldly placed barricades on the road checkmating such irksome criminal rape against our collective patrimony ghsl it would seem was hell bent on violating the implicit burden of fiduciary trust upon which the ajaokuta privatisation deal was predicated a fiduciary trust anchored on the expectation that they would produce steel products for the nigerian market while boosting jobs for the host communities on the contrary they saw themselves as triumphant vultures presiding over a dead carcass once beaten twice shy so do you agree with those who think ajaokuta steel complex is a white elephant project which nigeria does not desire at this stage of her development or do you think otherwise ajaokuta steel company limited was never a so called white elephant project but we made it so in order to sell it off the story of steel development in nigeria is a rather bitter one when the young general yakubu gowon took over the reins in 1966 our country was engulfed in war he understood that steel was the backbone of a nation s industrial prowess he also appreciated the direct correlation between industrial technological prowess and defence capabilities so he approached the british to help us develop our steel sector but they refused he thereafter approached the americans and they also turned him down the western powers got the world bank to manufacture fake statistics trying to prove that we did not need an iron and steel industry and that it was inimical to our development and what they idiotically term poverty alleviation it was after these failed efforts that the military administration turned to the defunct soviet union which they happily obliged unfortunately the ussr was not always transparent with us i was the organiser of an international workshop on the steel sector in kuru to engage with the russians and other stakeholders on our steel sector i do not have pleasant memories of our encounter with them as it turned out ajaokuta was programmed to produce exclusively steel rods which are used in construction rather than flat sheets which are vital to manufacturing we even got to know that there were vital operations of the plant which the russians would perform only from midnight to 5 00 am when all nigerian staff were fast asleep steel is the foundation of industrialisation and technological power an alloy of iron ore and carbon has wide ranging applications in industries such as construction machinery automobiles shipbuilding energy transportation and home appliances it is vital to the development of machine tools and precision engineering i need not underline the fact that without steel no nation could boast of any defence industry worthy of mention the rise of the european westphalian power state was largely shaped around the development of the steel sector and the development of heavy machinery for war making and sea faring england the first nation to industrialise was a world leader in steel making it was soon to be followed by germany through the development of iron steel and coal in its famous ruhr valley russia japan france sweden belgium and luxembourg were soon to follow in the path already laid out by the first industrialisers today there is a direct correlation between steel and the rate of growth of national economic and technological prowess nations in the throes of rapid technological takeoff tend to be major producers consumers of steel products this is less so for mature advanced industrial economies such as the usa and northern europe total world steel production currently stands at 1 6 billion metric tons with china accounting for 50 3 per cent of the world s total steel as a material is 100 per cent recyclable and reusable it is an industry with a turnover of 900b second only to the oil and gas sector it also employs more than 50 million people in terms of national production china leads the world with an annual production of 803 83 metric million tons mmt followed by the eu with 166 18 mmt japan with 105 mmt india with 89 mmt and usa with 78 92 mmt in emerging economies south africa leads the pack with 7 61 mmt followed by mexico with 18 26 mmt egypt with 5 51 mmt and uae with 3 01 mmt our country the so called giant of africa is not anywhere on the radar of world steel as we look to the future it is crucial that we take a strategic approach to the steel industry we must understand that world powers will never want nigeria to develop its steel sector they know for sure that we would become a global technological industrial power if our iron and steel sector were allowed to take off let me make it abundantly clear without a vibrant iron and steel sector we would achieve at best only arrested industrialisation why is it so difficult for our leaders to understand the critical importance of a thriving iron and steel sector the reasons are not too complex to decipher we have never had a developmental state committed to economic growth and industrialisation if we did our economic managers would long have understood the critical importance of the steel sector to our national development aspirations linked to this is the fact that we have never truly had a national development strategy worthy of the name when you look at great nations such as china india and south korea you get a clear impression that they have a long term development strategy they take a strategic approach to industrialisation economic growth and building a competitive economy that can stand its own under the pressures of our pressurised integrated global marketplace we have nothing of the sort these things are worsened of course by the incubi and succubi of grand corruption which saps the energies of our people undermines creativity and undermines the prospects for long term sustainable development our leaders are also very greedy in this country the cartels that control key sectors of the economy have often joined hands with people in government to deliberately kill off certain industries so as to justify their privatisation it is a case of giving a dog a bad name in order to hang it there is an argument put up that the federal government has demonstrated overtime that it was such a bad manager and as such has no business in business in addition to this it is claimed that selling some of these ailing firms off would help it cut down on the rising debt profile of the country are these tenable excuses i m afraid you can only sell that hogwash to the american marines key government enterprises such as nepa nitel nrc and the nigerian airways were deliberately killed by our leaders so as to turn around and justify their privatisation you would recall that most of those privatisation schemes were manufactured during the 1980s and 1990s with the imf world bank sponsored structural adjustment programmes sap that was when the so called washington consensus reigned supreme today the washington consensus is dead it was killed essentially by great recession and the sub prime crisis which exposed the emptiness of ideological monetarist neoliberalism any sensible economist today would tell you that the smartest thing to do is to seek a healthy balance between states and markets for my part i am an advocate of the developmental entrepreneurial state model we need smart governments working with and promoting creative businesses in a well regulated even playing field this allows for government enterprises in some sectors but with commitment to market principles including public private partnerships ppps in view of all that have happened how realistic is the vision of the founding fathers for the ajaokuta steel complex not too long ago russian ambassador nikolay udovichenko was quoted as saying that his country was prepared to work with the nigerian government to help revitalise the steel sector we should welcome such rapprochement with the new russia but i have my doubts a few years ago my good friend osita ogbu a technology policy expert and former chief economic adviser to the president did a brilliant research monograph on the development of our steel sector in which he recommended cooperation with japan as a way out for us i do not think osita understood japan well enough i have visited japan and i know how their mind works while they may have assisted south korea and other asia pacific countries in the early years of their industrialisation japan tows the western imperialist line when it comes to africa on this matter i have sometimes found them to be more catholic than the pope my first choice would have been for us to work with the north koreans they have an axe to grind with america and they are desperately looking for friends and allies they would provide perhaps most cost effective services available but considering that this option may be a diplomatic hot potato i would recommend we look at their brethren further south south korea has made prodigious leaps in economic and technological advancement a prosperous and stable democracy it is reputed to be the most wired society in the world today they also operate one of the most successful steel industries in the world with their pohang iron and steel company posco being the world s fourth largest steel maker with over 40 mmt annually the visionary president park chung hee against considerable domestic and international opposition started it in the 1960s park was deeply convinced that national self sufficiency in steel production was vital for the successful industrialisation of south korea with some technical assistance from nippon steel of japan and some financing from the japanese government posco began producing plate products in 1972 remarkable for a fully owned government entity posco possessed excellent leadership and management by the 1980s it was the fifth largest world producer with an annual 12 mmt a technical university was set up to train technologists and engineers in the metallurgical sciences pohang university of science and technology postech is ranked first among the 100 top world universities founded in the last 50 years by the times higher education supplement pohang once a small fishing settlement has been transformed into a sprawling industrial hub housing companies specialising in the manufacture of finished steel products precision engineering heavy industry and machine tools for domestic and world markets since the year 2000 posco has become a world leader and investor in steel making they have invested more than 26b in the chinese steel sector 12b in india and with other significant stakes in vietnam mexico indonesia and even our neighbouring cameroon posco is not only a great enterprise it is the most profitable steel maker in the world it was no surprise when warren buffett the world s most successful investor led his berkshire hathaway into taking a four per cent stake in the south korean steel giant if there is one potential technical partner that we should approach that entity is posco of south korea my approach would be to go into partnership with a global steel manufacturer on a profit sharing management contract basis we must build into the agreement commitment to training our engineers and scientists in metallurgy and steel manufacturing we must also insist that they must ensure production of more flat sheets than rods which seem to be the only thing that ajaokuta has ever produced all these years if you are opposed to the sale of state owned assets for the purpose of raising funds to finance budget what alternative ways can the country finance its fiscal spending without necessarily raising its debt burden beyond sustainable levels you have underlined two issues that are conceptually separate even though they are related to each other there is the question of public finance for the budget the other is the question of rising debts as we speak some 70 per cent of our annual budget goes into recurrent expenditure while only 30 per cent goes into capital investment in fact even these figures represent a marked improvement from the path dependence of the past when it used to be something like 22 per cent expenditure and 78 per cent capital investment we have skewed our budget spending egregiously in favour of consumption in this scenario asking me to sell off a vital sector such as steel because you want to fund a budget that is largely geared towards consumption is adding insult to injury nobody has ever talked about waste in this country there are areas of government expenditure that only reinforce waste and financial prodigality we must also curb the penchant for incurring all kinds of loans that are spent on wasteful expenditure with nothing to show as matters now stand the current administration met a national debt outlay of n11t which they have ballooned to over n23t a whopping 100 per cent increase the sad irony is that nigerians have become more impoverished than ever we have overtaken india as the world capital of poverty when bad managers run your public finances they lock you into debt peonage with nothing to show for it should your presidential ambition come to fruition what would you make of ajaokuta steel complex and other state owned assets that are comatose let me make it very clear i am not ideologically committed to either state ownership or market dogmatism i see myself as a heterodox economic pragmatist of course i believe that market solutions works best but like the great economic historian karl polanyi and the great economists such as john maynard keynes and joseph stiglitz i am a believer in states and markets working together to create the greatest good for the greatest number we need to look at things with detachment and objectivity those enterprises that we adjudge best to be left in government hands should be reformed and kept with the public sector those that are adjudged better left in the private sector would be privatised with reference to ajaokuta we would not behave like the dog that goes back to its vomit we tried privatisation before and it failed woefully we would approach the russians ukrainians or south koreans to join us in a management partnership we can work out the details through negotiation even though the world powers would not like it and will try to use bullying and intimidation to crash the project we must stand our grounds with courage and conviction the future of our country and our prospects as an emerging global industrial technological power depends on the success of ajaokuta steel company limited what s your assessment of the current administration s policy towards investment in ventures that have the capacity to catalyse growth through self sufficiency in local manufacturing beyond mouthing all sorts of bagatelles about agriculture under the anchor borrower s programme this government has no policy on manufacturing and industrialisation the geopolitical insecurity across the country has driven away foreign as well as local investors in fairness to the administration there is a marked improvement in food security to the extent that the food import bill particularly for rice is actually improving but this is a one off manufacturing is virtually comatose the industrial sector is dying factories are closing shop and foreign manufacturers are relocating to neighbouring countries part of the problem is of course the general deterioration in infrastructures and power supply it has been a nightmare of millennial proportions we have a government that adjudges any person with a bit of money in the bank to be a thief as a consequence market women are keeping their money under their beds the banks are groaning nobody is funding the real sector anymore the economy is in shambles there is despair everywhere another four years of these people and this economy will be destroyed completely i assure you any other further insight on your party s economic blueprint as far back as november 2018 ending we unveiled the economic blueprint of our adc administration it is anchored on seven priorities first we intend to confront headlong the security challenge that has turned our country into such a hobbesian nightmare for a decade our country has been involved in the second civil war much of its theatre being the north east the boko haram war has produced economic and humanitarian consequences more devastating than the biafra war today we have idps numbering more than three million the once prosperous north east is in shambles the entire economy of the north has been blighted added to this has been a low intensity internecine war perpetrated by well armed shadowy herdsmen peasants are abandoning their farms while heading towards over crowded cities such as abuja kaduna and jos at the same time our country has become the kidnap capital of the world conflict nihilistic violence and criminality have taken over we have thought through a master strategy to confront the enemies of peace in our country their days are numbered two we shall address the question of economic stabilisation economic stabilisation has to do with redressing the imbalances in the macro economy within three years our national debt has mushroomed from n11t to more than n23t the cbn has forgotten its mandate and is focusing on peripheral issues with an opacity that encourages corruption and rent seeking behaviour we currently spend 60 out of every 100 naira in servicing our debts and nobody knows what these loans have been used for our external reserves are dwindling inflation hovers well above the single digit threshold while the naira is suffering and the current account is heading south interest rates remain prohibitive in an economy run by bankers in the interest of other bankers banks are no longer in the business of giving loans they are busy trading currency and treasury bills as a consequence manufacturing is in the doldrums and investors are fleeing in droves bringing back the macro economy into steady state equilibrium is an absolute necessity for progress in the coming years only economists will understand these imperatives three we must address the question of poverty alleviation and job creation according to the un human development index in 2018 nigeria overtook india as the world capital of poverty nigeria s poor number 88 million while those of india stand at 70 million it focuses the mind when you grasp the reality behind these numbers india s 70 million poor represent some 20 per cent of her 1 2 billion population while our 88 million poor are almost 50 per cent of our 195 million people at the same youth unemployment is as high as 70 per cent in the poorest regions of borno and zamfara we have a welfare strategy based on the brazil model of bolsa familia and the zero hunger programme we aim for the goal of full employment by expanding public works approaches to infrastructure development four the power and infrastructures deficit needs to be addressed in a practical and original manner whatever little expenditure that is devoted to infrastructures is often frittered away by all sorts of stratagems and scams leading to white elephants strewn all over the place we need a focused approach to aggressive electrification while building a world class infrastructure base using public works approaches that create millions of jobs tackling power and solving the infrastructure conundrum is key to our long term prosperity on day one as president i will pass an executive order requiring all public buildings throughout our country to have solar panels on their roofs thousands of our youths will be trained in the manufacturing installation and maintenance of solar panels in addition to the development of other sustainable energy systems five we see structural diversification of the economy is an urgent imperative the era of oil is over economists tell us that we are entering a post industrial new hydrogen economy that will increasingly be based on sustainable energy systems rather than oil clearly our petrodollar rentier political economy is no longer sustainable it is dangerous for us to rely on one volatile commodity for 50 per cent of government revenue and 94 per cent of foreign earnings in the coming weeks and months our political elites must put this issue squarely on the table there have been humungous rhetoric but few understand what is at stake for us diversification will be anchored on deepening food security and agrarian production linking this sector to a mass based industrial revolution development of solid minerals expansion of petrochemicals and revitalisation of the tourism and services industry we also realise that this cannot be achieved without sustainable power and infrastructures we will pursue an aggressive policy of electrification for all we shall push for infrastructure such as harbours fast speed trains and highways and rural roads six we believe that human capital is of supreme importance people are the new wealth of nations education literacy training and skills are now the sources for the competitive advantage of nations in addition to universal access to health services putting forward ideas on how best to train our people and equip them with the right tools to succeed in an intensely competitive global economy is what will separate the men from the boys we believe in the political philosophy of obafemi awolowo we shall therefore give the highest priority to education we may not be able to promise free education for all at all levels but we shall as much as possible make it affordable we shall also provide a mix of student loans and scholarships where feasible we shall invest more in our universities while demanding higher levels of accountability for results seven implementing the third generation of institutional reforms is the key to long term prosperity the first generation reforms were the disastrous structural adjustment programmes of the eighties they failed because they were badly designed and were imposed by foreign powers that had their own selfish interests in mind rather our collective welfare as a nation the second generation reforms were implemented during obasanjo years 1999 2007 the third generation reforms require addressing the remaining bottlenecks in the economy including liberalisation of power distribution civil service reforms and creating an anti monopolies and fair competition regime to ensure an even playing field for economic actors nigerians need to be convinced that those who have ambition to govern understand these challenges and can come up with actionable solutions linked to this is the need to address the question of restructuring we prefer to call it constitutional re

stocks were on their way to their second consecutive big decline on thursday with the s p 500 index dropping as much as 2 91 percent after tuesday s 3 24 percent tumble markets were closed wednesday to mourn the death of former president george h w bush but then a rebound in tech shares helped cut the losses to a mere 0 15 percent still questions remain about why equities are so volatile there are three primary reasons 1 a trade war between the u s and china that drags on with no real path to resolution 2 bond market yield curves becoming inverted and 3 slower corporate profit growth if the focus were solely on the actual economy the mood on wall street might be markedly better of the three i d guess that the violent moves in the bond market over the past week have had the greatest impact given that an inverted yield curve has historically preceded a recession it doesn t matter than only a small portion of the curve has inverted with yields on five year treasury notes falling below those on three year notes the general sense among investors is that it s only a matter of time before the whole curve inverts tanking markets that may sound scary but it s not as if a recession would start the next day in fact it took an average of 21 months for a recession to start after each of the last five substantial yield curve inversions going back to 1980 according to deutsche bank then there s the fact that the economic data are pretty good the institute for supply management said thursday that its index of u s service industries rose unexpectedly in november to a near record level on friday the government is forecast to say that the economy added about 200 000 jobs last month with wages rising the most since 2009 alliancebernstein s former global director of economic research joseph g carson has recommended investors look at what he calls the economic yield curve which is still wide rather than focusing on the bond market s yield curve
first a review of last week s events eur usd one of the development scenarios supported however by only 30 of experts suggested a decline of the pair to the lower border of the medium term side channel 1 1300 1 1500 this is what happened having lost about 130 points the pair recorded the week low at the level of 1 1320 the reason for the strengthening of the dollar and as a result for the fall of the pair was the growth of anti risk sentiment due to increased pessimism in resolving the us china trade conflict and not the most favorable expectations for economic growth in the eurozone thus the european commission talking about significant risks has substantially lowered its forecast for the gdp growth from 1 9 to 1 3 in 2019 and from 1 7 to 1 6 in 2020 such an adjustment has significantly pressured the euro making the market understand that it is not worth expecting an increase in interest rates this year gbp usd in unison with the european commission the bank of england also declared that its previous forecasts were too optimistic and the lack of clarity with brexit is a burden for the country s economy the bank specialists expect the growth rate to be the lowest in the last 10 years as a result of which the uk gdp forecast for 2019 has been lowered from 1 7 to 1 2 the pound sank sharply on this negative news and as 65 of the experts had expected the pair reached 1 2850 then it rose a little against the background of an article about possible progress in negotiations on the british exit from the eu and special conditions for ireland and then sank again and completed the five day period at 1 2940 usd jpy the majority of analysts 70 supported by graphical analysis on d1 had expected strong fluctuations of the rate and the fall of the pair to the zone 108 00 108 55 after which it should return to the horizon 110 00 however contrary to forecasts the pair behaved very calmly and the maximum amplitude of its oscillations did not exceed 60 points for the third week in a row time after time the pair returns to the zone of 109 55 110 0 0 this time again starting the week session at the level of 109 55 the pair completed it at the level of 109 75 cryptocurrencies we divided the experts into two groups last week the first is those who believe that the current calm is the calm before the storm the second one thinks is that it is a lull before even more calm all week bitcoin quotes were falling smoothly and quietly reaching a low of 3 400 on wednesday february 6 then a very sluggish side followed and friday afternoon it jerked the btc usd rushed up in a matter of hours adding about 12 and reaching the level of 3 800 is this a precursor of a storm if you look at the graph h1 of course it is however everything is not so impressive on the daily timeframe the pair has just returned to the consolidation line or pivot point along which it has been moving for 11 weeks already starting from the end of november 2018 the reason for the growth was an interview fragment published in tweeter of one of the four sec commissioners robert jackson who said that the us securities and exchange commission may still allow the launch of bitcoin etf funds following bitcoin btc usd the rest of the top cryptocurrencies went up the greatest growth was demonstrated by litecoin ltc usd adding at its maximum 40 and reaching the price of 46 0 0 ethereum rose to the level of 124 70 and ripple xrp usd reached a height of 0 3250 as for the forecast for the coming week summarizing the opinions of a number of analysts as well as forecasts made on the basis of a variety of methods of technical and graphical analysis we can say the following eur usd it is clear that after the week long rally to the south most of the indicators are colored red however already 25 of oscillators on both h4 and d1 give signals the pair being oversold which means at least an upcoming strong correction if not a complete reversal of the trend a graphical analysis for the next five days draws lateral movement in the range of 1 1285 1 1400 after which the pair should return to the upper boundary of the medium term channel in the 1 1500 zone by the end of the month the expert community has not yet decided 50 expect the pair to fall 50 see its growth which is due to the lack of any clarity both on brexit and on the us china negotiations in addition the events of the coming week can make their own adjustments here we should bear in mind the publication of data on gdp of germany and the eu on thursday february 14 as well as on inflation and retail sales in the us on february 13 and 14 also on tuesday february 12 the market will look for signals from the head of the federal reserve j powell regarding a possible increase in interest rates meanwhile the level of recession expectations in the united states has risen to 20 and it is possible that the issue of interest rates will be postponed until better times eu and uk regulators are also constantly talking about the risks to economic growth which should entail easing monetary policy according to many experts this gives reason to think about buying stocks on the stock market because slowing economic growth while maintaining cheap money can lead to an increase in their prices here it makes sense to pay attention to portfolio investments in shares of the most reliable and promising global companies that are offered to their clients by the brokerage company nordfx gbp usd on monday february 11 data on gdp will be published and on wednesday february 13 there will be data on inflation in the uk most likely they will indicate a slowdown in the growth of the country s economy as already mentioned above thus according to forecasts gdp growth will decline compared with the previous quarter from 0 6 to 0 2 but like many months in a row news and rumors about brexit will have a major impact on quotes there is another category of rumors that some international companies are buying the british currency which bloomberg hinted at carefully and this gives the pound some support at the moment 60 of analysts have voted for the pound strengthening and rising of the pair to the horizon of 1 3040 and then another 80 100 points higher the remaining 40 of experts on the contrary expect the pair to drop to at least the level of 1 2830 but the graphical analysis on h4 has taken a compromise position indicating that the pair can first decline to the level of 1 2830 and only then go to growth reaching the height of 1 3040 usd jpy the prevailing color is gray that is neutral both with experts and indicators the strengthening of the us dollar against major world currencies is on one side of the scale on the other there are increased risks of a slowdown in the global economy and another round of tension between the united states and china which entails an increase in demand for a safe haven currency such as the japanese yen the pair managed to keep in a very narrow range of 109 55 110 15 for the whole week which indicates the complete uncertainty of the market and does not allow to make any predictions for the moment cryptocurrencies the full interview by sec commissioner robert jackson will be released this week and its content may both push the quotes further up or have the opposite effect after all whatever you say but the securities and exchange commission has almost 240 days to make a final decision on the application to launch bitcoin etf and during this time a lot can change in the meantime experts call its movement in the 3 250 3 800 range as the main scenario for the btc usd however they do not exclude the short term breakdown of the upper limit and the rise of the pair to the level of 4 000
by nick smyth global markets traded with a risk off tone for most of friday after trump said he wasn t planning to meet president xi before us tariffs on china are due to step up on march 1st equity markets fell across asia and europe although a late bounce in us equities left them marginally higher on the day the nzd was little changed on the day but nz rates experienced another sizable fall with the 10 year nz government bond yield hitting a record low level sentiment remained negative for much of the friday trading session with global equities extending the sell off from thursday trump told reporters that it was unlikely he would meet president xi face to face before the march 1st deadline date which would see tariffs raised on chinese imports while this doesn t preclude an extension of the trade ceasefire if the two sides can make sufficient progress in the talks and trump said he would maybe meet xi at later date the market took the news negatively concerns around us china trade with the clock ticking on the march 1st deadline date added to pre existing market worries around the state of global and in particular chinese growth us trade representative lighthizer and treasury secretary mnuchin visit china this week for further trade talks also not helping sentiment were reports in the german media that the us administration was considering car tariffs with a variety of options under consideration including tariff rates of 10 and 25 asian and european equities fell across the board extending thursday s declines the nikkei fell 2 and the hang seng opened almost 2 lower although it later recovered most of its earlier falls european equities were down between 0 5 and 1 the negative sentiment extended into the us trading session with the s p500 down almost 1 before a late rally left it 0 1 higher on the day and close to flat on the week there was no obvious trigger for the turn around in us equities although some commentators cited comments by san francisco fed president mary daly who raised the possibility of using qe as a more regular policy tool as helping to boost the market daly said you could imagine executing policy with your interest rate as your primary tool and the balance sheet as a secondary tool but one that you would use more readily although she added that no decision had been made there was no immediate reaction in bond or currency markets to the daly comments however the us 10 year treasury yield was 3bps lower on the day to 2 63 while the 10 year german bund fell 3bps to just 0 085 and the 10 year japanese government bond was down 2bps to 0 03 amidst relatively modest currency movements the usd ended friday marginally higher the usd indices were up around 1 on the week leaving them at their highest levels since early january although they remain well contained within the broader trading ranges of the past six months recent economic data continues to paint a picture of relative us economic strength compared to other g10 currencies even as the overall pace of us growth is slowing the top performing currency on the day was the canadian dollar 0 3 which was boosted by a much larger than expected increase in employment in january the canadian unemployment rate ticked up due to an increase in the participation rate but wage growth was also higher than expected the safe haven japanese yen and swiss franc were also slightly higher against the usd on the day amidst more cautious risk sentiment the aud came under pressure immediately after the release of the rba s statement of monetary policy somp despite governor lowe foreshadowing the downgrades to growth and inflation at his speech earlier in the week the aud fell from around 0 7090 before the release to 0 7060 the statement noted that the probability of cutting or hiking was more evenly balanced than previously although in the outlook section six of the seven risks mentioned were to the downside there was no sense of policy change urgency including no suggestion of a cut in the near future the aud retraced those losses over the remainder of the trading session to close the week at 0 7090 with a further surge in iron ore prices to 94 during the asian trading session the highest level in 4½ years assisting its recovery the nzd traded a relatively tight range on friday consolidating after the sharp fall in the wake of the disappointing nz employment report on thursday it closed the week at 0 6745 despite limited moves in the nzd nz rates continued to move sharply lower on friday nz swap rates were 3 to 4 5bps lower across the curve while the 10 year generic nz government bond yield reached a record low of 2 1 the decline in australian rates on friday after the somp and growing ocr rate cut expectations the market almost fully prices an ocr cut by the end of the year fuelled the moves in nz rates incredibly the 5 year swap rate at 1 9475 is now trading a mere 4bps above the 90 day bank bill rate the rbnz mps on wednesday is the key event risk for both the nz rates and currency markets with the market priced for dovish messaging from the bank besides the rbnz mps the week ahead sees the release of us cpi and retail sales while in australia the nab business survey is released australian business conditions fell sharply in december pointing to a subdued growth outlook and the survey will be closely watched for any potential bounce back in january another weak reading would add to rba rate cut expectations and probably ocr rate expectations too in politics the us government is heading for another shutdown on the 15th unless a funding deal can be agreed beforehand or president trump uses his emergency powers talks between republicans and democrats to avert a shutdown

new york after the synchronised global economic expansion of 2017 came the asynchronous growth of 2018 when most countries other than the united states started to experience slowdowns worries about us inflation the us federal reserve s fed policy trajectory ongoing trade wars italian budget and debt woes china s slowdown and emerging market fragilities led to a sharp fall in global equity markets toward the end of the year the good news at the start of 2019 is that the risk of an outright global recession is low the bad news is that we are heading into a year of synchronised global deceleration growth will fall towards and in some cases below potential in most regions to be sure the year started with a rally in risky assets us and global equities after the bloodbath of the last quarter of 2018 when worries about fed interest rate hikes and about chinese and us growth tanked many markets since then the fed has pivoted toward renewed dovishness the us has maintained solid growth and china s macroeconomic easing has shown some promise of containing the slowdown there whether these relatively positive conditions last will depend on many factors the first thing to consider is the fed markets are now pricing in the fed s monetary policy pause for the entire year but the us labour market remains robust were wages to accelerate and produce even moderate inflation above 2 per cent fears of at least two more rate hikes this year would return possibly shocking markets and leading to a tightening of financial conditions that in turn will revive concerns about us growth second as the slowdown in china continues the government s current mix of modest monetary credit and fiscal stimulus could prove inadequate given the lack of private sector confidence and high levels of overcapacity and leverage if worries about a chinese slowdown resurface markets could be severely affected on the other hand a stabilisation of growth would duly renew market confidence a related factor is trade while an escalation of the sino american conflict would hamper global growth a continuation of the current truce via a deal on trade would reassure markets even as the two countries geopolitical and technology rivalry continues to build over time fourth the eurozone is slowing down and it remains to be seen whether it is heading toward lower potential growth or something worse the outcome will be determined both by national level variables such as political developments in france italy and germany and broader regional and global factors obviously a hard brexit would negatively affect business and investor confidence in the united kingdom and the european union alike us president donald trump extending his trade war to the european automotive sector would severely undercut growth across the eu not just in germany finally much will depend on how eurosceptic parties fare in the european parliament elections this may and that in turn will add to the uncertainties surrounding european central bank president mario draghi s successor and the future of eurozone monetary policy fifth america s dysfunctional domestic politics could add to uncertainties globally the recent government shutdown suggests that every upcoming negotiation over the budget and the debt ceiling will turn into a partisan war of attrition an expected report from the special counsel robert mueller may or may not lead to impeachment proceedings against trump and by the end of the year the fiscal stimulus from the republican tax cuts will become a fiscal drag possibly weakening growth sixth equity markets in the us and elsewhere are still overvalued even after the recent correction as wage costs rise weaker us earnings and profit margins in the coming months could be an unwelcome surprise with highly indebted firms facing the possibility of rising short and long term borrowing costs and with many tech stocks in need of further corrections the danger of another risk off episode and market correction cannot be ruled out seventh oil prices may be driven down by a coming supply glut owing to shale production in the us a potential regime change in venezuela leading to expectations of greater production over time and failures by the organisation of the petroleum exporting countries to cooperate with one another to constrain output while low oil prices are good for consumers they tend to weaken us stocks and markets in oil exporting economies raising concerns about corporate defaults in the energy and related sectors as happened in early 2016 finally the outlook for many emerging market economies will depend on the aforementioned global uncertainties the chief risks include slowdowns in the us or china higher us inflation and a subsequent tightening by the fed trade wars a stronger dollar and falling oil and commodity prices though there is a cloud over the global economy the silver lining is that it has made the major central banks more dovish starting with the fed and the people s bank of china and quickly followed by the european central bank the bank of england the bank of japan and others still the fact that most central banks are in a highly accommodative position means that there is little room for additional monetary easing and even if fiscal policy was not constrained in most regions of the world stimulus tends to come only after a growth stall is already underway and usually with a significant lag there may be enough positive factors to make this a relatively decent if mediocre year for the global economy but if some of the negative scenarios outlined above materialise the synchronised slowdown of 2019 could lead to a global growth stall and sharp market downturn in 2020 nouriel roubini is ceo of roubini

unknown it is true that some of venezuela s economic problems are due to the ineptitudes of the bolivarian government s socialist command economy but this overlooks the role played by the united states the united nations and the european union is it oil and other natural riches like gold coltan diamonds and many more rare minerals venezuela with some 301 000 mmbbl billions of barrels of known reserves has about 12 more hydrocarbon reserves than saudi arabia shipping from the gulf to texas refineries takes 40 45 days and the risk of passing through the iran controlled strait of hormuz delivering oil from venezuela to texas takes some 2 4 days is it that venezuela committed a mortal sin when circumventing the petro dollar when trading her hydrocarbons notably with china and russia in other currencies like the gold convertible yuan remember saddam hussein and muamar gadhafi attempted similar dollar escaping actions and look what it brought them the us dollar hegemony depends very much on oil and gas trade in us dollars as per an agreement of the seventies between the us and saudi arabia head of opec is it that washington cannot tolerate any socialist or socialist leaning country in its backyard cuba and nicaragua beware is venezuela a crucial stepping stone to fully dominate latin america and her resources and hence a step closer to full power dominance of the world

is a research associate of the centre for research on globalization venezuela in the limelight on practically all the written audio and visual mainstream media as well as alternative media a purposeful constant drip of outright lies and half truths fake news as well as misleading information of all shades and hues about venezuela is drumming our brains slowly bending our minds towards believing that yes the us has a vital interest in meddling in venezuela and bringing about regime change because of primarily the huge reserves of oil but also of gold coltan and other rare minerals and finally simply because washington needs full control of its backyard but and yes there is a huge but as even some of the respected progressive alternative media pretend to know amidst all that recognition of the anglozionist empire s evil hands in venezuela this distorts already the entire picture and serves the empire and all those who are hesitantfor example one alternative news article starts bingo with such a low blow beginning some of the so called progressive writers have already been brain smeared by calling nicolás maduro a dictator when in fact in the last 20 years and since comandante hugo chavez frias was first elected in 1998 and came to power in 1999 they were all largely observed by the us based carter institute the latin american celac some were even watched by the european union eu the very vassal states that are now siding with washington in calling president maduro an illegitimate dictator former president carter once said by september 2017 the carter center had observed 104 elections in 39 countries despite this evidence are screaming and spreading lies election fraud and nicolás maduro is illegal a dictator oppressing his people depriving them of food and medication sowing famine he has to go such lies are repeated at nauseatum in a world flooded by pyramid dollars fake money the presstitute media have no money problem dollars the funding source for the massive lie propaganda are just printed as debt never to be repaid again so why worry i e the fed wall street the bis bank for international settlement the so called central bank of central banks the european central bank the bank of england and the banks of london the western public armchair warriors all the way to caviar socialists believe these lies that s how our unqualified brains apparently work a recent independent poll found thatdeciding themselves on how to resolve their internal problem economics and otherwise let me tell you something if mr maduro would be a dictator and all the diabolical adjectives that he is smeared with were to apply he would have long ago stopped thewhich is the western controlled media in venezuela theybut he didn t and doesn t because he believes in freedom of speech and freedom of the media even if the media are really nothing more than abject western lie machine presstitute mr maduro is generous enough not to close them down which any dictator of which there are now many in latin america take your pick argentina chile ecuador brazil colombia paraguay uruguay guatemala honduras would have done long ago from the very beginning when hugo chavez was first elected in 1998 washington attempted to topple him to bring about régime change the first real coup attempt took place on 11 april 2002 under full command by washington chavez was ousted for less than 2 days when an on swell of people and the vast majority of the military requested his reinstatement chavez was brought back from his island seclusion and thus the directly washington led coup d état was defeated the revolution will not be televised but the pressure mounted with economic sanctions becoming ever bolder and in the case of venezuela they had severe economic and humanitarian impacts becauseboth chavez and maduro had very little leeway of doing differently what they have already done sanctions boycotts outside money manipulations driving inflation to astronomical levels and constant smear propaganda these predicaments are biting hard the us has a firm grip on venezuela s dollar dependency last week he is now able to use venezuela s money in his us eu and lima group supported shadow government will he dare i don t think so however he has already invited us petrol companies to come to venezuela and invest in and take over the petrol industry of course it will not happen as president maduro stays in power firmly backed by the military all of this sounds like a bad joke did you ever hear of juan guaidó before the us and her european vassals almost unanimously and obediently aped washington in supporting him likewise theboth cases represent an extreme breach of confidence up to now it was ethically commercially and financially unthinkable that reserve money and gold deposited in foreign banks would not be safe from hooligan theft because that s what it is what the us is doing in a recent interview with rt president maduro said there was absolutely no need for humanitarian aid as the un suggested prompted by the us just look at syria libya iraq afghanistan to name just a few while the us 23 billion blocked in new york banks could have supplied venezuela with 20 years worth of medication for the venezuelan people maduro asserted venezuela has enough liquidity to feed and medicate her people however what this latest trump plunder the money and gold confiscation does is hammering one more nail in the western monetary system s suicide coffin is intrinsically and vassalically linked to the washington rogue state there is virtually no circumstance under which a countries assets in western foreign lands as bank deposits or foreign investments are safe away from the western also entirely privately owned swift international transfer system by which sanctions can be enacted indeed the russia and china and much of the sco shanghai organization cooperation members are no longer dealing in us dollars but in their own currencies we are talking abouteurope has started a half assed attempt to circumvent the dollar and swift system for dealing with iran short for instrument in support of trade exchanges it is a project of germany france and the uk suspiciously chaired by the latter to be endorsed by all 28 eu members it aims in a first instance at shipping humanitarian aid to iran similarly to venezuela iran s foreign minister javad zarif after learning about the details considered the conditions of instex as insulting and rejected any dealings with europe under this system iran he said does not need humanitarian aid not from europe not from anybody in the meantime what was to be expected has already happened the trump administration issued a stern warning of sanctions to the eu if they would attempt to deal with iran outside of the dollar system europe is likely caving in as they always do back in venezuela thethe extended arm of the cia has for the last two decades trained funded and infiltrated traitor agents into venezuela withhowever some of these agents are also lodged in venezuela s financial institutions as the where they sabotage often with threats any economic policies that could rescue venezuela from its economic predicament in june 2017 i was privileged to be a member of an economic advisory team to mr maduro during three days of intense discussions with government a number of potential short medium and long term solutions emerged they were well received by mr maduro and his economic team what became of these recommendations well maybe there are strong foreign directed forces at play to prevent their implementation clearly any accusation that the maduro government may bear the blame for some of the economic chaos have to be vigorously rejected mr maduro has very little space to maneuver the economy other than what he is already doing his actions are severely limited by the ever stronger squeeze by western claws with or without venezuela s new crypto currency the oil based petro with military threats and sanctions left and right there is little that the government can do in the immediate future to become autonomous yes russia and especially china will most likely help with balance of payment support loans with investments in the oil industry to ease venezuela s us dollar debt burden and vamp up oil production and in the medium and longer run they may also help boosting venezuela s agricultural sector towards 100 food self sufficiency i believe it s all of the above with a strong accent on venezuela s abandoning the us dollar as hydrocarbon trading currency putting the dollar hegemony even more at risk what it is already doing twenty years ago the us dollar dominated world reserve coffers with about 90 today that proportion has sunk to less than 60 the dollar is rapidly being replaced by other currencies notably the chinese yuan it is clear that the trump administration with these stupid actions of dishing out sanctions left and right punishing allies and foes alike if they deal with russia iran or venezuela and this special blunt regime change aggression in venezuela nominating a 35 year old us puppet trained in the us by cia as venezuela s new interim president confiscating venezuela s reserve assets in new york and london stopping importing petrol from venezuela and punishing anybody who imports venezuelan oil except of course russia and china the might of the us stops short of interfering in these non dollar deals with these and more ridiculous actions and military threats ever more countries are seeking alternative ways of doing business with currencies and monetary systems other than the dollar based fraudulent swift and eventually they will succeed all they need to do is joining the china russia sco system of transfer in their local currencies and the currencies of the eastern sco block and dedollarization is moving a step further ahead

washington in president donald trump s estimation the good times began to roll for the country on the night he was elected so he doesn t hesitate to swipe job growth from the twilight of the obama administration and claim it as his own that overreach seen in his state of the union speech and other forums extends to his boast about the shrinking numbers of people on food stamps where he s helped himself even more heartily to obama era progress likewise a surge in energy production under president barack obama ended up on trump s ledger of achievement advertisement trump s speech to congress made for a bountiful week of exaggeration partial truth and outright error some highlights jobs trump we have created 5 3 million new jobs and importantly added 600 000 new manufacturing jobs something which almost everyone said was impossible to do state of the union speech the facts that s not what he s done he s measuring from election day in november 2016 rather than when he took office on jan 20 2017 since january 2017 the u s has added 4 9 million jobs not 5 3 million of them 454 000 were in manufacturing not 600 000 according to the bureau of labor statistics trump apparently reasons that employers and investors were so encouraged by his victory that they stepped up their hiring and investing right after the nov 8 election but the economy simply does not turn on a dime like that and trump did not inherit a mess here s what history will record more jobs were created in obama s last two years 5 1 million than in trump s first two years 4 9 million advertisement growth in manufacturing employment began in obama s second term when 386 000 jobs were added and accelerated under trump food stamps trump nearly five million americans have been lifted off food stamps state of the union address the facts the number of people receiving food stamps actually hasn t declined nearly that much since trump took office or even since he was elected in january 2017 42 7 million people were using food stamps that declined to 38 6 million in september 2018 a drop of 4 1 million not nearly five million monthly comparisons don t mean much because the numbers go up and down over the short term a more meaningful measure is how many people were using food stamps on average over the course of a year by that measure the food stamp rolls declined by only 1 8 million in the 2017 and 2018 budget years even that period which began in october 2016 includes a substantial drop that happened under obama go back to october 2015 the start of the 2016 budget year and the drop is 3 9 million energy trump we have unleashed a revolution in american energy the united states is now the no 1 producer of oil and natural gas in the world state of the union address the facts that depends on what the definition of we is his claim is true in the unlikely event he was also crediting obama and other recent presidents who were aggressive about energy production the government says the u s became the world s top natural gas producer in 2013 under the obama administration the u s now leads the world in oil production too under trump that s largely because of a boom in production from shale oil which also began under obama economy trump in just over two years since the election we have launched an unprecedented economic boom a boom that has rarely been seen before there s been nothing like it an economic miracle is taking place in the united states state of the union address the facts the president is vastly exaggerating what has been a mild improvement in growth and hiring the economy is healthy but not nearly one of the best in u s history the economy expanded at an annual rate of 3 8 percent last spring and summer a solid pace but it was just the fastest in four years in the late 1990s growth topped 4 percent for four straight years a level it has not yet reached under trump in 1984 growth even reached 7 2 percent almost all independent economists expect slower growth this year as the effect of the trump administration s tax cuts fade trade tensions and slower global growth hold back exports and higher interest rates make it more expensive to borrow to buy cars and homes trump the u s economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when i took office state of the union address the facts this may be true we don t know the exact growth figure for 2018 because the 35 day partial government shutdown has delayed the release of fourth quarter data if it turns out to be roughly 3 percent as expected that would be close to double the 1 6 percent growth of 2016 a slow year surrounded by better ones growth in 2015 was 2 9 percent for example health care trump the next major priority for me and for all of us should be to lower the cost of health care and prescription drugs and to protect patients with pre existing conditions state of the union address the facts his rhetoric is at odds with his actions when it comes to protecting people with pre existing medical conditions in reality his administration is seeking in a lawsuit to eliminate such coverage his justice department is arguing in court that those protections in the obama era health law should fall the short term health plans trump often promotes as a bargain alternative offer no guarantee of covering pre existing conditions government lawyers said in legal filings last june that they will no longer defend key parts of the affordable care act including provisions that guarantee access to health insurance regardless of any medical conditions then attorney general jeff sessions wrote in a letter to congress that trump approved the legal strategy a federal judge in texas in december ruled the entire obama era law including coverage for pre existing conditions was unconstitutional because congress repealed its fines on uninsured people the suit has moved to the 5th u s circuit court of appeals in new orleans in the meantime the law s provisions remain in effect trump has hailed the initial court ruling as great and predicted that it would go to the supreme court and be upheld obama s health care law requires insurers to take all applicants regardless of medical history and patients with health problems pay the same standard premiums as healthy ones bills supported in 2017 by trump and congressional republicans to repeal the law could have pushed up costs for people with pre existing conditions immigrants jobs trump working class americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration reduced jobs state of the union address the facts employment data suggest that the influx of immigrants helps increase overall hiring for the u s economy rather than erode job growth the trend is clear in the government s monthly jobs report the statistics don t distinguish between immigrants who are in the u s legally and illegally nearly 64 percent of immigrants hold jobs compared with roughly 60 percent of workers born in the united states according to the labor department last year immigrants accounted for roughly 40 percent of the 2 4 million jobs added because a steady growth in the workforce helps the economy expand economists say fewer immigrants would equal slower growth and fewer jobs falling birth rates and the retirement of the vast generation of baby boomers mean fewer people will flow into the workforce in the coming years a drag on economic growth which will in turn probably limit hiring many economists have noted that adding immigrants would help maintain the flow of workers into the economy and support growth immigrants wages trump working class americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration lower wages state of the union address the facts the weight of research suggests that immigrants have not suppressed wages david card an economist at the university of california berkeley first studied the issue in 1990 by reviewing the arrival of cuban migrants in miami during the 1980 mariel boat lift this historical rush of immigrants created a natural experiment to measure what then happened to incomes in the local area he concluded the influx appears to have had virtually no effect on the wages or unemployment rates of less skilled workers giovanni peri an economist at the university of california davis studied immigration into california between 1960 and 2005 he wrote in a 2010 paper that it had essentially no effect on wages or employment of native born workers but many people seeking to reduce immigration rely on research from george borjas a harvard economist his research found that the arrival of cubans in the mariel boat lift caused wages to fall for native born high school dropouts in miami other economists have questioned his methodology in addition borjas findings would apply to a small fraction of u s jobholders today only about 6 2 percent of whom lack a high school degree other explanations for sluggish wage growth go beyond immigration they include the decline in unionization an intensified push to maximize corporate profits growing health insurance costs that supplant wages and the rise of a lower wage global labor force that in an intertwined worldwide economy can hinder pay growth for americans labor force trump all americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before state of the union address trump more people are working now than at any time in the history of our country one hundred fifty seven million people at work the facts yes but that s because the population has grown it s more than doubled since 1950 and in recent months it s been increasing by 150 000 to nearly 200 000 per month births are the primary driver of population growth with immigration also contributing in 2030 that s expected to change with immigration overtaking the natural increase from births exceeding deaths as for women the big question is whether greater percentages of them are working or searching for a job than at any point in history and on this count women have enjoyed better times women s labor force participation rate right now is 57 5 percent according to the labor department the rate has ticked up recently but it was higher in 2012 and peaked in 2000 at roughly 60 percent overall 63 2 percent of americans are working or looking for work that s a few ticks higher than when trump was inaugurated when it was 62 9 percent but far below the 2000 peak of 67 3 percent the rate has declined partly because of aging as a wave of baby boomers retire but even among younger workers it s below where it was nearly two decades ago border el paso trump the border city of el paso texas used to have extremely high rates of violent crime one of the highest in the entire country and considered one of our nation s most dangerous cities now immediately upon its building with a powerful barrier in place el paso is one of the safest cities in our country simply put walls work and walls save lives state of the union address the facts that s a distorted picture of el paso where trump is going monday to showcase his push for a border wall el paso has never been considered one of the nation s most dangerous cities in fact its murder rate was less than half the national average in 2005 the year before the start of its border fence the city has experienced ebbs and flows in violent crime but they have largely mirrored national trends and been under national averages for decades border security trump the lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety and security and financial well being of all america state of the union address the facts whether the border is sufficiently secure or not cuts to the core of a heated national debate but it s far from lawless the number of people arrested for crossing illegally has plunged in the past decade and is near its lowest level since the mid 1990s illustrating a substantial downward trend in the number of migrants trying to sneak in border patrol personnel detection technology and physical barriers have increased in that time legal immigration trump i want people to come into our country in the largest numbers ever but they have to come in legally state of the union address the facts his policy recommendations to date do not reflect this wish the plan he proposed upon taking office would have sharply limited the ability of citizens and permanent residents to bring in family which he derisively called chain migration the cato institute which favors more open immigration policies estimated his plan would cut the number of legal immigrants by up to 44 percent the largest cut to legal immigration since the 1920s according to data from the homeland security department about 750 000 of more than 1 1 million people who obtained green cards in 2017 or two thirds did so through family relations trump s plan called for limiting family based green cards to spouses and minor children of u s citizens and green card holders a dramatic cut he s also slashed the number of refugees the u s will accept for two straight years and he wants to eliminate diversity visas he s talked about switching to merit based instead of family based immigration and said at times that he wants to make it easier for temporary workers to work and graduates from top colleges to stay in the country but researchers have said the net effect of his proposals would be fewer legal immigrants middle east wars trump our brave troops have now been fighting in the middle east for almost 19 years state of the union address the facts trump exaggerated the length of the wars in iraq and afghanistan the war in afghanistan began in october 2001 in the aftermath of the sept 11 attacks the invasion of iraq was in march 2003 the u s has been at war for a bit more than 17 years also he refers to fighting in the middle east iraq is in the middle east but afghanistan is in central asia stacey abrams economy abrams former candidate for georgia governor in the democratic response to trump s speech the republican tax bill rigged the system against working people rather than bringing back jobs plants are closing layoffs are looming and wages struggle to keep pace with the actual cost of living the facts the economy is doing better after the introduction of the trump administration s tax cuts than abrams suggests the number of people seeking unemployment benefits a proxy for layoffs briefly fell to a five decade low last month and average hourly pay is running ahead of inflation tariffs trump we recently imposed tariffs on 250 billion of chinese goods and now our treasury is receiving billions of dollars state of the union address the facts this is misleading yes money from tariffs is going into the federal treasury but it s largely coming from u s businesses and consumers it s not foreign countries that are paying these import taxes by cutting a check to the government his reference to money coming into the treasury now belies the fact that tariffs go back to the founding of the country this revenue did not start with his increased tariffs on some goods from china tariffs did produce 41 3 billion in tax revenues in the last budget year according to the treasury department but that is a small fraction of a federal budget that exceeds 4 1 trillion the tariffs paid by u s companies also tend to result in higher prices for consumers which is what happened for washing machines after the trump administration imposed import taxes trade nafta trump our new u s mexico canada agreement or usmca will replace nafta and deliver for american workers bringing back our manufacturing jobs expanding american agriculture protecting intellectual property and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with the four beautiful words made in the usa state of the union address the facts it s unlikely to do all those things because the new agreement largely preserves the structure and substance of nafta in addition the deal has not been ratified and its chances in congress are uncertain in one new feature the deal requires that 40 percent of cars contents eventually be made in countries that pay autoworkers at least 16 an hour that is in the united states or canada but not in mexico it also requires mexico to pursue an overhaul of labor law to encourage independent unions that will bargain for higher wages and better working conditions for mexicans still just before the agreement was signed general motors announced that it would lay off 14 000 workers and close five plants in the united states and canada philip levy a senior fellow at the chicago council on global affairs and a trade official in republican president george w bush s white house says president trump has seriously overhyped this agreement drug pricing trump already as a result of my administration s efforts in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years state of the union address the facts trump is selectively citing statistics to exaggerate what seems to be a slowdown in prices a broader look at the data shows that drug prices are still rising but more moderately some independent experts say criticism from trump and congressional democrats may be causing pharmaceutical companies to show restraint the consumer price index for prescription drugs shows a o 6 percent reduction in prices in december 2018 when compared with december 2017 the biggest drop in nearly 50 years the government index tracks a set of medications including brand drugs and generics however that same index showed a 1 6 percent increase when comparing the full 12 months of 2018 with the entire previous year the annualized number gives you a better picture said economist paul hughes cromwick of altarum a nonprofit research organization it could be that something quirky happened in december separately an analysis of brand name drug prices by the associated press shows there were 2 712 price increases in the first half of this january as compared with 3 327 increases during the same period last year the size of this year s increases was not as pronounced both this year and last the number of price cuts was minuscule the information for the analysis was provided by the health data firm elsevier wages trump wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades and growing for blue collar workers who i promised to fight for they re growing faster than anyone else thought possible state of the union address the facts this is an unsupported statement because the data on hourly wages for private workers only go back to 2006 not decades but data on wages for production workers date back to 1939 and trump s claim appears to be unfounded average hourly earnings for production and nonsupervisory workers are up 3 4 percent over the past year according to the labor department those wage gains were higher as recently as early 2009 and they were averaging roughly 4 percent before the start of the great recession in late 2007 there are other ways to track wage gains and those don t work in trump s favor either adjusted for inflation median weekly wages rose just 0 6 percent in 2018 the gains in weekly wages were 2 1 percent in 2015 abrams migrant children abrams in the democratic response we know bipartisanship could craft a 21st century immigration plan but this administration chooses to cage children and tear families apart the facts the cages that abrams mentions are actually chain link fences and the obama administration used them too children are held behind them inside holding border patrol facilities under the trump administration as well obama s administration detained large numbers of unaccompanied children inside chain link fences in 2014 images that circulated online of children in cages during the height of trump s family separations controversy were actually from 2014 when obama was in office children are placed in such areas by age and sex for safety reasons and are held for up to 72 hours by the border patrol the department of homeland security s inspector general visited five detention facilities for unaccompanied children on the texas border with mexico in late june during the height of the furor over family separations and found they appeared to comply with detention standards the government watchdog reported that cleanliness was inconsistent but that the children had access to toilets food drinks clean bedding and hygiene items at the height of the family separations about 2 400 children were separated since then 118 children were separated immigration officials are allowed to take a child from a parent in certain cases serious criminal charges against a parent concerns over the health and welfare of a child or medical concerns that policy has long been in place and is separate from the now suspended zero tolerance trump administration policy that saw children separated from parents only because they had crossed illegally minority unemployment trump african american hispanic american and asian american unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded state of the union address the facts what he s not saying is that the unemployment rates for all three groups have gone up since reaching record low levels black unemployment reached a record low 5 9 percent in may but rose to 6 8 percent in january latino unemployment fell to 4 4 percent its lowest ever last october and asian unemployment fell to a record low of 2 2 percent in may but latino and asian unemployment also have increased in part because of the government shutdown which elevated unemployment last month the african american rate is still nearly double the jobless rate for whites at 3 5 percent the most dramatic drop in black unemployment came under obama when it fell from a recession high of 16 8 percent in march 2010 to 7 8 percent in january 2017 human trafficking trump human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the united states and to sell them into prostitution and modern day slavery state of the union address the facts his administration has not supplied evidence that women and girls are smuggled by the thousands across remote areas of the border for these purposes what has been established is nearly 80 percent of international trafficking victims cross through legal ports of entry a flow that would not be stopped by a border wall trump distorts how often trafficking victims come from the southern border according the counter trafficking data collaborative a global hub for trafficking statistics with data contributed by organizations from around the world the national human trafficking hotline a venture supported by federal money and operated by the anti trafficking group polaris began tracking individual victim records in 2015 from january through june 31 2018 it

calvin woodward hope yen and christopher rugaber associated press washington in president donald trump s estimation the good times began to roll for the country on the night he was elected so he doesn t hesitate to swipe job growth from the twilight of the obama administration and claim it as his own that overreach seen in his state of the union speech and other forums extends to his boast about the shrinking numbers of people on food stamps where he s helped himself even more heartily to obama era progress likewise a surge in energy production under president barack obama ended up on trump s

drug prices are still rising but more moderately some independent experts say criticism from trump and congressional democrats may be causing pharmaceutical companies to show restraint the consumer price index for prescription drugs shows a o 6 percent reduction in prices in december 2018 when compared with december 2017 the biggest drop in nearly 50 years the government index tracks a set of medications including brand drugs and generics however that same index showed a 1 6 percent increase when comparing the full 12 months of 2018 with the entire previous year the annualized number gives you a better picture said economist paul hughes cromwick of altarum a nonprofit research organization it could be that something quirky happened in december separately an analysis of brand name drug prices by the associated press shows there were 2 712 price increases in the first half of this january as compared with 3 327 increases during the same period last year the size of this year s increases was not as pronounced both this year and last the number of price cuts was minuscule the information for the analysis was provided by the health data firm elsevier wages trump wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades and growing for blue collar workers who i promised to fight for they re growing faster than anyone else thought possible state of the union address the facts this is an unsupported statement because the data on hourly wages for private workers only go back to 2006 not decades but data on wages for production workers date back to 1939 and trump s claim appears to be unfounded average hourly earnings for production and nonsupervisory workers are up 3 4 percent over the past year according to the labor department those wage gains were higher as recently as early 2009 and they were averaging roughly 4 percent before the start of the great recession in late 2007 there are other ways to track wage gains and those don t work in trump s favor either adjusted for inflation median weekly wages rose just 0 6 percent in 2018 the gains in weekly wages were 2 1 percent in 2015 abrams migrant children abrams in the democratic response we know bipartisanship could craft a 21st century immigration plan but this administration chooses to cage children and tear families apart the facts the cages that abrams mentions are actually chain link fences and the obama administration used them too children are held behind them inside holding border patrol facilities under the trump administration as well obama s administration detained large numbers of unaccompanied children inside chain link fences in 2014 images that circulated online of children in cages during the height of trump s family separations controversy were actually from 2014 when obama was in office children are placed in such areas by age and sex for safety reasons and are held for up to 72 hours by the border patrol the department of homeland security s inspector general visited five detention facilities for unaccompanied children on the texas border with mexico in late june during the height of the furor over family separations and found they appeared to comply with detention standards the government watchdog reported that cleanliness was inconsistent but that the children had access to toilets food drinks clean bedding and hygiene items at the height of the family separations about 2 400 children were separated since then 118 children were separated immigration officials are allowed to take a child from a parent in certain cases serious criminal charges against a parent concerns over the health and welfare of a child or medical concerns that policy has long been in place and is separate from the now suspended zero tolerance trump administration policy that saw children separated from parents only because they had crossed illegally minority unemployment trump african american hispanic american and asian american unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded state of the union address the facts what he s not saying is that the unemployment rates for all three groups have gone up since reaching record low levels black unemployment reached a record low 5 9 percent in may but rose to 6 8 percent in january latino unemployment fell to 4 4 percent its lowest ever last october and asian unemployment fell to a record low of 2 2 percent in may but latino and asian unemployment also have increased in part because of the government shutdown which elevated unemployment last month the african american rate is still nearly double the jobless rate for whites at 3 5 percent the most dramatic drop in black unemployment came under obama when it fell from a recession high of 16 8 percent in march 2010 to 7 8 percent in january 2017 human trafficking trump human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the united states and to sell them into prostitution and modern day slavery state of the union address the facts his administration has not supplied evidence that women and girls are smuggled by the thousands across remote areas of the border for these purposes what has been established is nearly 80 percent of international trafficking victims cross through legal ports of entry a flow that would not be stopped by a border wall trump distorts how often trafficking victims come from the southern border according the counter trafficking data collaborative a global hub for trafficking statistics with data contributed by organizations from around the world the national human trafficking hotline a venture supported by federal money and operated by the anti trafficking group polaris began tracking individual victim records in 2015 from january through june 31 2018 it tracked 35 000 potential victims of those there was a near equal distribution between foreigners on one hand and u s citizens and legal permanent residents on the other most of the labor trafficking victims were foreign and most of the sex trafficking victims were u s citizens of foreign nationals mexico had the most frequently trafficked associated press writers josh boak juliet linderman colleen long ricardo alonso zaldivar ellen knickmeyer jill colvin and lolita c baldor in washington and elliot spagat in

not with a bang but with a whimper without all the fire and fury that we saw in december markets are once again pricing in a slowdown in global economic growth it could be strongly argued this is evidence of how important us fed support is to equity market strength but that s a drum to beat over and over again on another day credit peter braig fundamentally traders are quietly re pricing for a world where economic growth will be weaker than once thought such behaviour has been long evident in chinese markets so there s nothing new about pessimism in the asian region the point of focus now is in europe and to a lesser extent north america which is increasingly demonstrating signs that market participants believe those economies are briskly approaching a period of even lower rates growth and inflation
all amounts in u s dollars unless otherwise indicated brookfield news feb 08 2019 globe newswire brookfield renewable partners l p tsx bep un nyse bep brookfield renewable today reported financial results for the three and twelve months ended december 31 2018 we continued to execute on our strategic priorities strengthening our investment grade balance sheet and enhancing our global investment capabilities during the year this allowed us to generate 14 per unit ffo growth in 2018 for unitholders said sachin shah ceo of brookfield renewable looking ahead we believe our combination of operational depth and financial strength positions us well to deliver long term stable returns for unitholders in light of our recent growth strong balance sheet and access to capital we are pleased to announce that our board has declared a 5 increase to the quarterly distribution bringing our annual payout to 2 06 per unit added mr shah financial results for the periods ended december 31 us

average lp units redeemable exchangeable partnership units and gp units totaled 312 2 million and 312 6 million respectively 2017 312 6 million and 305 8 million brookfield renewable reported funds from operations of 676 million or 2 16 per unit for the twelve months ended december 31 2018 compared to 581 million or 1 90 per unit for the same period in 2017 this reflects growth of 16 and 14 respectively these strong results were supported by contributions from acquisitions and recently commissioned facilities and the advancement of our organic growth initiatives brookfield renewable 2018 highlights ffo increased 14 on a per unit basis over the prior year as all of our businesses performed in line with expectations executed on cost reduction initiatives in the u s and colombia this should improve margins by approximately 20 million annually in the future enhanced our operating teams in the u s europe india and china over the year to support our longer term plans in these markets commissioned 60 megawatts of new wind and hydro development advanced over 350 megawatts of development in our pipeline and maintained our opportunistic approach to development which minimizes funding obligations and ongoing costs invested 550 million into growth initiatives during the year including acquisitions development and unit buy backs capitalized on market volatility and repurchased approximately 2 million units at an average 27 per unit executed on our asset recycling strategy selling a partial interest in mature assets and exiting non core markets extended all near term debt maturities during the year increasing the average duration of our debt to 10 years we now have no material debt maturities until 2023 maintained an investment grade balance sheet increased available liquidity which should exceed 2 2 billion once signed asset sales and the announced sale of an additional interest in our portfolio of select canadian hydroelectric assets are closed and improved our distribution payout ratio to 95 of ffo on an actual basis and 90 of ffo on an annualized basis operating and financial results during the year our focus was on integrating recently acquired assets and enhancing our operational depth at terraform power post the acquisition and sponsorship by brookfield the company was able to stabilize operations reinstate preventative maintenance programs engage with suppliers and establish new teams and processes this should lead to improved asset availability more predictable capital expenditures and enhanced operating margins over time in addition in terraform power we completed a significant acquisition of recently built wind and solar assets in spain which almost doubled the cash flows of the company on an annualized basis and facilitated the overall improvement of the company s capital structure this assisted us to eliminate negative financing covenants and improve terraform power s balance sheet rating the acquisition should provide stable long term cash flows to terraform power at accretive low teen returns and based on recent announcements of improving tariffs in spain could exceed our expectations we have one of the largest hydroelectric businesses in the world which we have doubled in size and expanded across multiple geographies over the last 5 years these assets contributed 671 million to ffo in 2018 hydroelectric assets benefit from long useful lives often over 100 years low operating and ongoing capital costs and the ability to match power supply with demand given their embedded battery like characteristics operationally we continue to lengthen the term of our power purchase contracts in colombia and brazil where power price volatility provides opportunities to enhance and stabilize future revenues our contracts in both markets are generally at or below market and therefore we see term extension as a unique opportunity to lock in upside in north america power prices remain low and therefore we continue to sign shorter term contracts at our hydro facilities to ensure we retain upside optionality if prices spike we have several large legacy ppas rolling off over the next three years for assets that deliver power to new england fortunately these contracts on a net basis deliver power at prices in the range of the current market therefore on renewal we expect overall revenue to be impacted by 5 million to bep beyond these contracts we do not have any material ppa maturities in north america until 2029 our wind assets delivered 160 million of ffo in 2018 over the last 18 months we more than tripled the installed capacity of our wind fleet through large scale and tuck in acquisitions and development projects coming online given that we now have a portfolio of wind assets across ten countries and four continents this geographic diversification provides a significant mitigating benefit to resource variability and is a good example of why we prioritize diversification as a key value driver of our business our solar storage and other operations contributed 104 million of ffo in 2018 as we benefitted from large scale acquisitions in 2017 and 2018 today we have nearly 1 800 megawatts of photovoltaic concentrated thermal csp and distributed generation solar as well as 2 700 megawatts of both pumped and battery storage our solar facilities are underpinned by highly contracted cash flows with an average remaining ppa term of 17 years our storage facilities continue to provide critical grid stabilizing ancillary services and back up storage capacity products that are becoming increasingly valuable given the intermittency of wind and solar balance sheet and liquidity we currently have no material debt maturities over the next four years and our overall debt duration exceeds 10 years we have limited exposure to rising rates with only 7 of our debt in north america and europe exposed to rising rates we are well protected from foreign exchange volatility hedging all our developed market currencies we also hedge currencies when we are in the process of an asset sale as we did for example with our select canadian hydroelectric assets and our south african portfolio locking in very attractive returns on these disposals accordingly an overall 10 move in the currencies of markets we operate in developed or emerging would have an overall 4 impact to our ffo post completion of recently announced asset sales we will have 2 2 billion of available liquidity over the course of the year we announced or completed key capital raising initiatives across the portfolio these initiatives included the sale of a 25 interest in a portfolio of select canadian hydroelectric assets as well as the announced sale of an additional 25 interest a small wind development project in the u k as well as sales of our non core assets in south africa thailand and malaysia which were agreed in 2018 and which we expect to close in the first half of 2019 looking forward we have a robust pipeline of assets that we believe would attract low cost of capital buyers in a sales process therefore we expect the majority of our growth to be funded by the proceeds from asset sales cash flows retained in the business and issuances of preferred equity or corporate debt as such while we may issue equity when it makes financial sense given the above noted funding sources we are not reliant on accessing this market to fund our growth distribution declaration the next quarterly distribution in the amount of 0 515 per lp unit is payable on march 29 2019 to

a cia world factbook entry listing nations current account balances shows that big economies and near failed states share something in common massive debt this liability making them strong cases for hyperbitcoinization which could be exacerbated by an anticipated global economic slowdown also read governmental overreach in developing nations will hasten hyperbitcoinization debt ridden economies prime cases for hyperbitcoinization hyberbitcoinization theorists have little faith in the fiat establishment they believe that state authorities who control national currencies will erode them to a point where citizens will be forced to ditch them for bitcoin resulting in entire countries being powered by peer to peer decentralized currency the hyperbitcoinization theory h theory published by daniel krawisz of the satoshi nakamoto institute in 2004 predicts that bitcoin will lead to demonetization of currencies that will lose value as people settle for bitcoin as a superior option bitcoin will be attractive as it is not subject to capital controls maintains value as fiat currencies erode and is an inclusive financial instrument into other economies though purely numeric the cia list running up to 2017 details governments long standing habits from the heavy borrowing war like giants at the bottom to struggling ones in the middle and disciplined spenders at the top current account balance compares a country s net trade in goods and services plus net earnings and net transfers to and from the rest of the world during the period specified the agency explains in regards to the criterion of the list which is calculated on an exchange rate basis the u s sits at the bottom of the intelligence agency s list with a negative balance of 466 2 billion just beneath the u k which is also wallowing in borrowed affluence with a balance of 106 7 billion india canada turkey france and australia make up the bottom eight with 11 digit negative balances citizens commonly bank on their authorities to painlessly manage debt and forestall dramatic ripples in their own lifestyles governments in turn are given to their habits from shoring up geopolitical hegemony and staging spectacles in endless wars to printing money for bloated civil service payrolls and punishing the poorest citizens with austerity when the day of reckoning arrives fiat currency overlords leave citizens poorer since jack ma criticized the u s for blowing its fortune on war at davos the country has failed to sizeably reduce its military footprint and in fact gotten closer to confrontation with military giants like russia china and north korea with potential proxy battle zones like venezuela emerging the national debt incurred by the military industrial complex is ultimately spread across households with taxpayers on the hook for trillions of dollars of spending the u s is also notoriously oil intensive with 50 percent of its consumption going to oil imports the value of the dollar is therefore tied to oil prices and has depreciated as oil prices doubled between 2001 and 2006 and then went up 50 percent between 2006 and 2008 affecting domestic households through reduced purchase power there is an upside to this however in that america s status as one of the world s most technologically advanced nations would work in its favor in the event of hyperbitcoinization occurring in countries like north korea military might takes primacy over the economic wellbeing of citizens countries like zimbabwe are not known aggressors but military spending helps insulate the regime from economic discontent citizens have experienced central bank heists in two decades in which their savings were substantially eroded by questionable monetary policies in venezuela where a humanitarian breakdown is now coupled with political confrontation citizens have resorted to bitcoin to keep their heads above the chaos zimbabwe has been slower to transition to bitcoin but the perennial erosion of the currency is a strong case for cryptocurrency and an increasing number of students are redirecting hyperbitcoinization in oil rich venezuela would be driven by cheap electricity which makes bitcoin mining ideal the more affluent states on the list particularly the u k are advanced in technology making the penetration of cryptocurrency easier whereas their counterparts in the global south will be affected by the divide some rural populations in the southern hemisphere lack reliable electricity and internet connectivity placing crypto transactions out of reach hyperbitcoinization is a dystopian bet having nurtured the infrastructure required to disrupt fiat hegemony bitcoin visionaries are waiting for state actors to torch their own world and drive citizens to cryptocurrency unlike fiat currencies which can be inflated from reserve bank printing presses there is a finite amount of bitcoin that can ever enter circulation safe from capricious state authorities and free from central control it is emergency money on standby for any nation whose people need it what do you think about the concept of hyperbitcoinization and which countries are mostly likely to be affected by such an

the venezuela myth keeping us from transforming our economy modern monetary theory mmt is getting significant media attention these days after rep alexandria ocasio cortez said in an interview that it should be a larger part of our conversation when it comes to funding the green new deal according to mmt the government can spend what it needs without worrying about deficits mmt expert and bernie sanders adviser professor stephanie kelton says the government actually creates money when it spends the real limit on spending is not an artificially imposed debt ceiling but a lack of labor and materials to do the work leading to generalized price inflation only when that real ceiling is hit does the money need to be taxed back but even then it s not to fund government spending instead it s needed to shrink the money supply in an economy that has run out of resources to put the extra money to work predictably critics have been quick to rebut calling the trend to endorse mmt disturbing and a joke that s not funny in a feb 1 post on the daily reckoning brian maher darkly envisioned bernie sanders getting elected in 2020 and implementing quantitative easing for the people based on mmt theories to debunk the notion that governments can just print the money to solve their economic problems he raised the specter of venezuela where money is everywhere but bare essentials are out of reach for many the storefronts are empty unemployment is at 33 percent and inflation is predicted to hit 1 million percent by the end of the year blogger arnold kling also pointed to the venezuelan hyperinflation he described mmt as the doctrine that because the government prints money it can spend whatever it wants until it can t he said to me the hyperinflation in venezuela exemplifies what happens when a country reaches the it can t point the country is not at full employment but the government can t seem to spend its way out of difficulty somebody should ask these mmt rock stars about the venezuela example i m not an mmt rock star and won t try to expound on its subtleties i would submit that under existing regulations the government cannot actually create money when it spends but that it should be able to in fact mmters have acknowledged that problem but it s a subject for another article what i want to address here is the hyperinflation issue and why venezuelan hyperinflation and qe for the people are completely different animals what is different about venezuela venezuela s problems are not the result of the government issuing money and using it to hire people to build infrastructure provide essential services and expand economic development if it were unemployment would not be at 33 percent and climbing venezuela has a problem the u s does not and will never have it owes massive debts in a currency it cannot print itself namely u s dollars when oil its principal resource was booming venezuela was able to meet its repayment schedule but when the price of oil plummeted the government was reduced to printing venezuelan bolivars and selling them for u s dollars on international currency exchanges as speculators drove up the price of dollars more and more printing was required by the government massively deflating the national currency it was the same problem suffered by weimar germany and zimbabwe the two classic examples of hyperinflation typically raised to silence proponents of government expansion of the money supply before venezuela suffered the same fate professor michael hudson an actual economic rock star who supports mmt principles has studied the hyperinflation question extensively he confirms that those disasters were not due to governments issuing money to stimulate the economy rather he writes every hyperinflation in history has been caused by foreign debt service collapsing the exchange rate the problem almost always has resulted from wartime foreign currency strains not domestic spending venezuela and other countries that are carrying massive debts in currencies that are not their own are not sovereign governments that are sovereign can and have engaged in issuing their own currencies for infrastructure and development quite successfully i have discussed a number of contemporary and historical examples in my earlier articles including in japan china australia and canada although venezuela is not technically at war it is suffering from foreign currency strains triggered by aggressive attacks by a foreign power u s economic sanctions have been going on for years causing the country at least 20 billion in losses about 7 billion of its assets are now being held hostage by the u s which has waged an undeclared war against venezuela ever since george w bush s failed military coup against president hugo chávez in 2002 chávez boldly announced the bolivarian revolution a series of economic and social reforms that dramatically reduced poverty and illiteracy as well as improved health and living conditions for millions of venezuelans the reforms which included nationalizing key components of the nation s economy made chávez a hero to millions of people and the enemy of venezuela s oligarchs nicolás maduro was elected president following chávez s death in 2013 and vowed to continue the bolivarian revolution recently as saddam hussein and moammar gadhafi had done before him he defiantly announced that venezuela would not be trading oil in u s dollars following sanctions imposed by president trump the notorious elliott abrams has now been appointed as special envoy to venezuela considered a war criminal by many for covering up massacres committed by u s backed death squads in central america abrams was among the prominent neocons closely linked to bush s failed venezuelan coup in 2002 national security adviser john bolton is another key neocon architect advocating regime change in venezuela at press conference on jan 28 he held a yellow legal pad prominently displaying the words 5 000 troops to colombia a country that shares a border with venezuela clearly the neocon contingent feels it has unfinished business there bolton does not even pretend that it s all about restoring democracy he blatantly said on fox news it will make a big difference to the united states economically if we could have american oil companies invest in and produce the oil capabilities in venezuela as president nixon said of u s tactics against salvador allende s government in chile the point of sanctions and military threats is to squeeze the country economically killing the public banking revolution in venezuela it may be about more than oil which recently hit record lows in the market the u s hardly needs to invade a country to replenish its supplies as with libya and iraq another motive may be to suppress the banking revolution initiated by venezuela s upstart leaders the banking crisis of 2009 10 exposed the corruption and systemic weakness of venezuelan banks some banks were engaged in questionable business practices others were seriously undercapitalized others still were apparently lending top executives large sums of money at least one financier could not prove where he got the money to buy the banks he owned rather than bailing out the culprits as was done in the u s in 2009 the government nationalized seven venezuelan banks accounting for around 12 percent of the nation s bank deposits in 2010 more were taken over chávez s government arrested at least 16 bankers and issued more than 40 corruption related arrest warrants for others who had fled the country by the end of march 2011 only 37 banks were left down from 59 at the end of november 2009 state owned institutions took a larger role holding 35 percent of assets as of march 2011 while foreign institutions held just 13 2 percent of assets over the howls of the media in 2010 chávez took the bold step of passing legislation defining the banking industry as one of public service the legislation specified that 5 percent of the banks net profits must go toward funding community council projects designed and implemented by communities for the benefit of communities the venezuelan government directed the allocation of bank credit to preferred sectors of the economy and it increasingly became involved in private financial institutions operations by law nearly half the lending portfolios of venezuelan banks had to be directed to particular mandated sectors of the economy including small business and agriculture in a 2012 article titled venezuela increases banks obligatory social contributions u s and europe do not rachael boothroyd said that the venezuelan government was requiring the banks to give back housing was declared a constitutional right and venezuelan banks were obliged to contribute 15 percent of their yearly earnings to securing it the government s great housing mission aimed to build 2 7 million free houses for low income families before 2019 the goal was to create a social banking system that contributed to the development of society rather than simply siphoning off its wealth boothroyd wrote venezuelans are in the fortunate position of having a national government which prioritizes their life quality wellbeing and development over the health of bankers and lobbyists pay checks if the 2009 financial crisis demonstrated anything it was that capitalism is quite simply incapable of regulating itself and that is precisely where progressive governments and progressive government legislation needs to step in that is also where in the u s the progressive wing of the democratic party is stepping in and why ocasio cortez s proposals evoke howls in the media of the sort seen in venezuela article i section 8 of the constitution gives congress the power to create the nation s money supply congress needs to exercise that power the key to restoring our economic sovereignty is to reclaim the power to issue money from a commercial banking system that acknowledges no public responsibility beyond maximizing profits for its shareholders bank created money is backed by the full faith and credit of the united states including federal deposit insurance access to the fed s lending window and government bailouts when things go wrong if we the people are backing the currency it should be issued by the people through their representative government today s government however does not adequately represent the people which is why we first need to take our government back thankfully that is exactly what ocasio cortez and

article businessdesk feb 11 businessdesk reserve bank governor adrian orr will probably acknowledge the increasing storm clouds on the horizon globally but nobody is expecting him to make any change to interest rate settings on wednesday when he releases the latest no change on wednesday but is the ocr headed up down or sideways to editor by jenny ruth feb 11 businessdesk reserve bank governor adrian orr will probably acknowledge the increasing storm clouds on the horizon globally but nobody is expecting him to make any change to interest rate settings on wednesday when he releases the latest monetary policy statement all the attention will be on the tone of the statement and on any changes to the language from the last statement in november back then orr expected to keep the official cash rate at a record low 1 75 percent since november 2016 unchanged into 2020 the market will also be watching for any changes to the each way bet orr took in november as to which direction he will next move the ocr all of the 18 banks and merchant banks bloomberg surveyed expect no change to the ocr until late this year at the earliest mark lister the head of wealth research at craigs investment partners says little has changed much since november inflation has been slightly stronger but economic growth a little weaker than expectations and dairy prices have been stronger in the recent global dairy trade auctions the big change has been in the abrupt bearish turns from federal reserve chair jerome powell and reserve bank of australia governor philip lowe and the worsening outlook for global growth particularly in china and europe last week lowe delivered an ocr decision using language the market took as encouraging and the australian dollar rallied later in the week lowe indicated the market s interpretation was incorrect and that the outlook for australia s economy is so uncertain that he may have to cut his ocr from its current 1 5 percent record low powell has gone from promising to raise the fed s cash rate three more times this year last october to two likely hikes this year in december he is now promising to be patient with his increasing caution fuelled by signs of slowing growth in the united states and the trade tensions between the us and china if the fed s no longer hiking then that suggests that other central banks around the world have to re think their forecasts as well a kind of re basing effect lister says he s expecting orr will still want to hedge his bets there have been some genuine indications that growth has tapered off a little but there are still a lot of what ifs out there financial markets are pricing in a 42 percent chance of an ocr cut by the end of june and a 100 percent chance of a cut within the next 12 months as yet only one banking house in bloomberg s survey shares the market s view anz bank chief economist sharon zollner says the economy is clearly coming off the boil trading partner growth is slowing markedly we are forecasting an ocr cut by year end whether the reserve bank changes their growth and ocr forecasts meaningfully or not zollner is far from alone in noting the economy has been slowing but she clearly isn t expecting the pick up in activity others are predicting the potential growth risks are accumulating she says the potential growth impacts of a more marked global slowdown are now a more pertinent risk than any delayed impact from last year s slump in business confidence she says nevertheless there are upside risks to inflation that s still the reserve bank s key mission tempered by needing to try to promote maximum sustainable employment while figures last week showed the unemployment rate jumped to 4 3 percent in the december quarter from a revised 4 percent in the september quarter the labour market remains very tight although there are few signs of wage inflation yet zollner notes that firms are reporting sharply higher costs but very modest pricing intentions and something has to give pricing intentions and costs don t tend to move in opposite directions for long bloomberg s survey shows anz is expecting more than one ocr cut it expects it to go to 1 5 percent in the fourth quarter this year and to 1 percent in the first quarter next year asb bank is expecting the ocr to remain where it is through the second quarter of next year but others such as bank of new zealand are still expecting an ocr hike to 2 percent in the december quarter this year followed by a second hike to 2 25 percent in the march quarter of next year jane turner an economist at asb bank says she expects orr will acknowledge the increasing downside risks to the economic outlook but she expects that will probably prove temporary she also says that rising inflation pressures will mean the need for higher interest rates in coming years but she thinks those higher rates will be delivered by the reserve bank s requirement that banks must hold more capital in future to reduce the risk of bank failure the central bank s current proposal which is currently out for consultation is that the big four banks will have to about double their equity capital our key message is that we continue to expect borrowing rates to rise gradually in coming years however a significant part of this increase is now likely to come through increased bank funding costs with the ocr to do less of the lifting bnz head of research stephen toplis says his bank may well change its ocr forecast delaying an expected rate hike until 2020 he points out that while the jump in the december unemployment rate surprised the market it still came in a notch below the reserve bank s 4 4 percent forecast surely the reserve bank must now sit on its hands when it releases its february mps next wednesday we see little justification for a shift to either a more or less aggressive stance than it held in november and we see significant justification for the bank to buy itself more time toplis says with changes to the central bank s structure it is about to move from the governor having sole responsibility for monetary policy to a committee structure there is an ongoing review of the reserve bank and there are other changes planned on the prudential front the reserve bank governor currently has more pressing issues to contend with than fiddling with interest rates toplis says given the reserve bank s dual mandate of price stability and maximum sustainable employment it seems to us that both are being achieved if anything inflation is slightly shy of its target but the unemployment rate and other job shortage indicators caution that the current tightness in the labour market might be beyond sustainable businessdesk ends content sourced from scoop co nz original url

spend whatever it wants until it can t he said to me the hyperinflation in venezuela exemplifies what happens when a country reaches the it can t point the country is not at full employment but the government can t seem to spend its way out of difficulty somebody should ask these mmt rock stars about the venezuela example i m not an mmt rock star and won t try to expound on its subtleties i would submit that under existing regulations the government cannot actually create money when it spends but that it should be able to in fact mmters have acknowledged that problem but it s a subject for another article what i want to address here is the hyperinflation issue and why venezuelan hyperinflation and qe for the people are completely different animals what is different about venezuela venezuela s problems are not the result of the government issuing money and using it to hire people to build infrastructure provide essential services and expand economic development if it were unemployment would not be at 33 percent and climbing venezuela has a problem that the us does not have and will never have it owes massive debts in a currency it cannot print itself namely us dollars when oil its principal resource was booming venezuela was able to meet its repayment schedule but when oil plummeted the government was reduced to printing venezuelan bolivars and selling them for us dollars on international currency exchanges as speculators drove up the price of dollars more and more printing was required by the government massively deflating the national currency it was the same problem suffered by weimar germany and zimbabwe the two classic examples of hyperinflation typically raised to silence proponents of government expansion of the money supply before venezuela suffered the same fate prof michael hudson an economic rock star who supports mmt principles has studied the hyperinflation question extensively he confirms that those disasters were not due to governments issuing money to stimulate the economy rather he writes every hyperinflation in history has been caused by foreign debt service collapsing the exchange rate the problem almost always has resulted from wartime foreign currency strains not domestic spending venezuela and other countries that are carrying massive debts in currencies that are not their own are not sovereign governments that are sovereign can and have engaged in issuing their own currencies for infrastructure and development quite successfully a number of contemporary and historical examples were discussed in my earlier articles including in japan china australia and canada although venezuela is not technically at war it is suffering from foreign currency strains triggered by aggressive attacks by a foreign power us economic sanctions have been going on for years causing at least 20 billion in losses to the country about 7 billion of its assets are now being held hostage by the us which has waged an undeclared war against venezuela ever since george w bush s failed military coup against president hugo chavez in 2002 chavez boldly announced the bolivarian revolution a series of economic and social reforms that dramatically reduced poverty and illiteracy and improved health and living conditions for millions of venezuelans the reforms which included nationalizing key components of the nation s economy made chavez a hero to millions of people and the enemy of venezuela s oligarchs nicolas maduro was elected president following chavez s death in 2013 and vowed to continue the bolivarian revolution like saddam hussein and omar gaddafi before him he defiantly announced that venezuela would not be trading oil in us dollars following sanctions imposed by president trump the notorious elliott abrams has now been appointed as special envoy to venezuela considered a criminal by many for covering up massacres committed by us backed death squads in central america abrams was among the prominent neocons closely linked to bush s failed venezuelan coup in 2002 national security advisor john bolton is another key neocon architect advocating regime change in venezuela at a january 28 press conference he held a yellow legal pad prominently displaying the words 5 000 troops to colombia a country that shares a border with venezuela apparently the neocon contingent feels they have unfinished business there bolton does not even pretend that it s all about restoring democracy he said on fox news it will make a big difference to the united states economically if we could have american oil companies invest in and produce the oil capabilities in venezuela as president nixon said of us tactics against allende s government in chile the point of sanctions and military threats is to squeeze the country economically killing the public banking revolution in venezuela it may be about more than oil which recently hit record lows in the market the us hardly needs to invade a country to replenish its supplies as with libya and iraq another motive may be to suppress the banking revolution initiated by venezuela s upstart leaders the banking crisis of 2009 10 exposed the corruption and systemic weakness of venezuelan banks some banks were engaged in questionable business practices others were seriously undercapitalized others were apparently lending top executives large sums of money at least one financier could not prove where he got the money to buy the banks he owned rather than bailing out the culprits as was done in the us in 2009 the government nationalized seven venezuelan banks accounting for around 12 of the nation s bank deposits in 2010 more were taken over the government arrested at least 16 bankers and issued more than 40 corruption related arrest warrants for others who had fled the country by the end of march 2011 only 37 banks were left down from 59 at the end of november 2009 state owned institutions took a larger role holding 35 of assets as of march 2011 while foreign institutions held just 13 2 of assets over the howls of the media in 2010 chavez took the bold step of passing legislation defining the banking industry as one of public service the legislation specified that 5 of the banks net profits must go towards funding community council projects designed and implemented by communities for the benefit of communities the venezuelan government directed the allocation of bank credit to preferred sectors of the economy and it increasingly became involved in the operations of private financial institutions by law nearly half the lending portfolios of venezuelan banks had to be directed to particular mandated sectors of the economy including small business and agriculture in an april 2012 article called venezuela increases banks obligatory social contributions u s and europe do not rachael boothroyd said that the venezuelan government was requiring the banks to give back housing was declared a constitutional right and venezuelan banks were obliged to contribute 15 of their yearly earnings to securing it the government s great housing mission aimed to build 2 7 million free houses for low income families before 2019 the goal was to create a social banking system that contributed to the development of society rather than simply siphoning off its wealth boothroyd wrote venezuelans are in the fortunate position of having a national government which prioritizes their life quality wellbeing and development over the health of bankers and lobbyists pay checks if the 2009 financial crisis demonstrated anything it was that capitalism is quite simply incapable of regulating itself and that is precisely where progressive governments and progressive government legislation needs to step in that is also where the progressive wing of the democratic party is stepping in in the us and why aoc s proposals evoke howls in the media of the sort seen in venezuela article i section 8 of the constitution gives congress the power to create the nation s money supply congress needs to exercise that power key to restoring our economic sovereignty is to reclaim the power to issue money from a commercial banking system that acknowledges no public responsibility beyond maximizing profits for its shareholders bank created money is backed by the full faith and credit of the united states including federal deposit insurance access to the fed s lending window and government bailouts when things go wrong if we the people are backing the currency it should be issued by the people through their representative government today however our government does not adequately represent the people we first need to take our government back and that is what aoc and her congressional allies are attempting to do first published on truthdig com

the past six weeks have seen markets shift rapidly between white knuckled anxiety through an exuberant rebound to hey wait a minute this week in finance us china trade talks resume in beijing china trade balance thursday us china trade talks resume in beijing china trade balance thursday australian business tuesday and consumer confidence wednesday data are released this week australian business tuesday and consumer confidence wednesday data are released this week asx results season reports include jb hifi monday amcor tuesday cochlear and csl wednesday south32 woodside and amp thursday this week s pause for reflection was inspired by a number of disappointments hopes for a resolution of us china trade tensions were kicked further down the road again the outlook for the global economy became even cloudier and corporate earnings forecasts ratcheted down a notch or two no doubt some profits were simply taken off the table given the easy money made since the start of the year it poses the question why was that money so easy what happened to repair the 20 per cent bite the bears took out of wall street the australian market fell a less vertiginous 11 per cent between october and christmas the belief the federal reserve would back off its ambitions helped change sentiment as did a couple of tweets from the realdonaldtrump account talking up a trade deal with china the trump trade tweets may not have been on the money but betting on the fed to soften its stance paid off handsomely fed chairman jerome powell did not so much slowly tighten things he wrenched the monetary jalopy into a u turn his statement that in light of global economic and financial developments the fed would be patient and was prepared to use its full range of tools if things got really nasty meant money printing aka quantitative easing qe was back in the mix qe was the unconventional monetary plumbing tool the fed pulled out of its back pocket to open jammed liquidity taps in the depths of the global financial crisis rather than slashing interest rates which was limited once they hit zero the fed quickly followed by the other big central banks in europe and japan bought trillions of dollars worth of bonds to drive down borrowing costs and flood the world s banks with new money to lend as the international money fund noted in its global financial stability report late last year the unconventional policies have seen total nonfinancial sector debt borrowings by governments nonfinancial companies and households expand at a much faster pace than the growth rate of the economy the idea was once things had stabilised the central banks would just allow the bonds to be run off to maturity pfft gone it was supposed to be a relatively short term addiction but as it is said old habits die hard dangerous habits often have an even stickier end a concerted money printing operation by global central banks already appears to have kicked in weeks before mr powell opened up about the possibility of getting back on his full range of tools 2mg asset management s mike mangan says since the market meltdown scare in december the four largest central banks have increased the size of their balance sheets by us428 billion 603 3 billion to global liquidity across the last month that s a big change to the us1 2 trillion of liquidity central banks drained out the financial system in the previous nine months the big four central banks had been shrinking their balance sheets until equity markets crumbled in december supplied 2mg asset management bloomberg a very logical panic it is entirely logical central bankers should panic at the first whiff of market trouble mr mangan said mr mangan argues the world is so loaded up with debt and in particular corporate bank and government debt any market correction risks spiralling out of control into global financial crisis type abyss or worse data compiled by the institute of international finance recently showed global debt has swelled to us250 trillion which is a bit more than three times the size of total global gdp the corporate and bank sectors account for more than half of that they also hold the riskiest debt as the imf global financial stability report pointed out rather nervously there are also about us1 3 trillion of so called leverage loans lurking out there these are loans extended to already financially stretched companies or companies with less than pristine credit histories lenders carry higher risk and borrowers pay more the loans are pooled chopped up and syndicated to various lenders in individual tranches sounds familiar those tranches are called collateralised loan obligations clos that s it a not too distant relative of the collateralised debt obligations cdos cobbled together out of the us subprime debt that were basically the root cause of the global financial crisis but hey financial markets have learned their lesson with this stuff haven t they really what could go wrong credit market headwinds us11 trillion in corporate debt is due to mature in the next four years reuters gary hershorn a report released last week by the big global credit ratings agency standard poor s s p found us11 trillion in corporate debt it rated is scheduled to mature between now and the end of 2023 things are not exactly plain sailing at the moment in credit markets credit market issuance is slowing with multiple headwinds that have been straining the market including central bank policy normalisations in the us and europe the uncertain terms of brexit and slowing economic growth in china as well as in much of the developed world diane vazza head of s p s fixed income research said the credit ratings agency described the ability of corporates to repay that mountain of debt as largely manageable largely manageable doesn t sound like a cast iron guarantee and it assumes something nasty like a market meltdown doesn t happen again and that s what s worrying mr mangan and many others managing large licks of money the big mistake central bankers made in 2008 was failing to recognise the contagion impact of subprime debt he said it took the fall of lehman some 18 months after subprime first emerged as an issue before the monetary fire brigade turned up that s why central bankers need to panic any time a correction starts to spiral out of control as was threatened last christmas eve stop the 50 bs it was an issue us president donald trump was well ahead of the curve on sending his central bank boss a very public rocket in the midst of the december market swoon needing to keep the message short and sharp below 280 characters mr trump fired off a tweet right across the white house south lawn and straight down constitution avenue to the fed s hq don t let the market become anymore illiquid than it already is stop the 50 b s feel the market don t just go on meaningless numbers good luck it said while the stop the 50 b s may have been rather cryptic to most down at the fed and on wall street they knew exactly what it meant end the monthly us50 billion run off of the multi trillion asset base built up during the post financial crisis money printing binge many in the investment banking fund manager world had long blamed the monthly run off for some unnerving market wobbles clearly the president found more merit in the bankers argument than the fed s a short while later the fed agreed too however some find it all rather disheartening including 2mg s mr mangan trade wars venezuela huawei us shutdown slowing economies et al are all very important but it s the 50 bs that overrides everything else mr mangan said that being the case there is a very high probability january s bull market kicks on as mr mangan points out the return to a bull equity market may well continue even as global economic conditions deteriorate take italy now officially in recession italian stocks just experienced their best january since 2011 he said the us s p has just had its best january since 1987 but eps forecasts fell the most in three years as mr mangan says it s all about the 50 bs overriding almost everything else the question remains are these bloated central bank balance sheets sustainable the architects of qe would say no otherwise why was it always the intention to run them off with the 50 bs if they are not sustainable what happens on the day of reckoning someone will have to pick up the tab it s unlikely to be the banks as we ve already learned they have been deemed too big to fail in the short term though the market sails blithely on content a dovish fed outweighs soft earnings forecasts the us and china still failing to find common ground and the global economy cooling rapidly markets pause friday was a bit iffy with a late

in president trump s state of the union address we saw a brilliant display of rhetorical sleight of hand on the economy the successful misdirection was enabled by the corporate news media which consistently maintains that the one thing trump should be claiming credit for is his stellar performance growing the economy this story first appeared on salon what was ignored was how it has also grown increasingly more unequal and tilted to the rich since he took office as the country sinks deeper and deeper into a miasma of long term multi trillion dollar debt in the critical commentary that followed the sotu the only quibbling on trump s assessment of the nation s economy was that he had failed to credit his predecessor president obama for getting things headed in the right direction for those assembled in the house chamber and those watching at home trump waved the shiny object of an economic miracle taking place in the united states an unprecedented economic boom a boom that has rarely been seen before so despite our life expectancy declining for the last three years one of the highest childhood poverty rates among the 36 member nations in the organization for economic co operation and development and the most expensive and least effective health care system among western developed nations trump would have us believe we are the envy of the world and with the tv cut away shots of the assembled men and women of congress and the decorated generals all nodding their heads and occasionally applauding there was legitimacy conferred on one man s delusion that the united states is the fastest growing economy in the world and that he is the key accelerant as richard wolff professor of economics at the new school pointed out trump s assertion of u s global economic preeminence ignores the reality that for many years now china has been growing exponentially faster than the united states the u s has struggled mightily to expand at all even as the richest got an increasingly larger share of the nation s wealth hmm could there be a connection between our increasingly extreme wealth concentration and sluggish broad based economic growth over the last twenty years the u s has had a hard time achieving economic growth and even though it is averaging two and a half to three percent part of the time to say that it s the best in the world that s just a lie wolff says let me give you just one example the people s republic of china they re having a bad year ready six and a half percent which is lower than they have been able to do for most of the last 15 to 20 years and what you might wonder were wages doing for workers all that time of major growth in china the real wages of chinese workers the average amount of money they got adjusted for inflation has quadrupled in the last 12 to 15 years says wolff what happened to the average wage in america adjusted for inflation it hardly budged it went up single digits not three to four times what made trump s magic sotu misdirection so complete was how right after he waved the glittery miracle of faux american prosperity in the air he conjured up the raping and pillaging hordes of blood sucking illegals that are coming over the southern border in waves that threaten to take it all away wolff points out that while trump cast undocumented immigrants as the only shadow on american greatness he didn t mention one word about the nation s growing wealth and income inequality which is the starkest feature of american economic life in the last 40 years of course it is in the interest of the builders of the great american wealth pyramid to continue to breathe life into this trumpian delusion that the american economy is working and working well ignoring the very real socio economic deterioration that has now manifested after decades of depressed and anemic wages and the degree to which there is a collective media buy in that things are great and improving the longer it will take for us to fully embrace the radical steps needed to get this country really working for all of america s families this never ending squeezing of americans who have to work every day to make a living has now mushroomed into a full blown affordability crisis that has tens of millions of working class american households struggling every month to cover the basics we had ample evidence of this during trump s 35 day government shutdown when furloughed federal workers had to wait on soup lines trump didn t mention them either

migrants die and disappear in staggeringly high numbers along the u s mexico border as washington over the years has shut down relatively safe traditional urban entry points forcing border crossers into hostile desert terrain migrants also sustain severe life threatening or crippling injuries they fall into mine shafts and break their backs dehydration damages their kidneys others are bitten by snakes or injured in chases the tall metal fences that run as barriers along segments of the border also serve as weapons migrants sever limbs climbing the barriers and break bones falling off them border related trauma is so common anthropologist ieva jusionyte writes that it has become normalized first responders who work the borderlands around nogales arizona told jusionyte that they believe the sheet metal border fence that used to separate nogales from its mexican sister city was intentionally designed to sever body parts border crossers one nogales firefighter said regularly used to get their fingers cut off that fence was replaced in 2011 but the new high bollard style fence 20 or 30 feet high in places frequently causes broken bones when migrants fall from it in recent months border patrol agents and federal troops have festooned long stretches of the border fence with razor wire including in nogales that wire is lethal and i really don t know what they re thinking by putting it all the way down to the ground nogales s mayor complained now six coils of concertina wire cover the fence like vines facing a residential neighborhood onto a street that serves as a route for school buses every weekday the city s children look out and can imagine that they are living inside a concentration camp more than two years into the administration of donald trump such gratuitous displays of cruelty are common working to wear down on the nation s moral sensibility concertina wire recently added by u s army troops covers the u s side of the border wall in nogales arizona on feb 7 2019 photo laura saunders for the intercept but the use of border barriers to inflict pain in the hope that news of injuries and deaths will serve as a deterrent to other would be migrants long predates the trump presidency the idea reaches back at least to the 1970s to the presidency of jimmy carter when the u s began to turn its attention away from vietnam toward its southern border a weaponized fence is a feature not a bug of federal policy carter s fence in 1978 carter s immigration and naturalization service requested and congress approved 4 3 million to build a fence on the u s mexico border the plan was to quietly replace some 27 miles of existing slack rusted chain link around the ports of entry in san ysidro california and el paso texas and then add a new fence along an additional 6 miles of border after consulting with the u s army the ins hired potomac research a virginia firm to design the new barrier and then signed a 2 million federal contract with houston based anchor post products to build the fence the carter administration had inherited the project from richard nixon who was the first president to propose building some kind of barrier along the entire 2 000 mile border the project moved forward largely ignored by the press until october 1978 that month a big mouthed manager from anchor post named george norris told a reporter that the razor sharp wall was designed to be bloody built with punched out metal that would leave edges sharp enough to cut off the toes of barefoot climbers norris said that his company had double checked with the engineers at potomac research whether they wanted the metal deburred filed when we first got the job the engineers according to norris said no leave it sharp they instructed as part of the deterrent the cut metal was meant to sever body parts norris said a climber would leave his toe permanently embedded in it the remarks were picked up by mexican dailies as outrage spread representatives from the ins and potomac research issued denials nobody in the ins ever told anyone to design a fence that would hurt people said one of potomac research s engineers we were told explicitly that there could be no barbed wire no barbed tape no electrification but carter s head of the ins leonardo castillo admitted the proposed steel latticework did appear sharper than it was intended to be a construction worker pulls steel mesh into place on a section of the galvanized steel fence being built along the border between the u s and mexico in 1979 photo stephanie maze corbis via getty images carter who would soon visit mexico city was caught off guard telling a reporter that he didn t know anything about the fence and that any sort of fencing device that would injure people is certainly contrary to my own inclinations the tortilla curtain as the scandal was soon dubbed was condemned by mexican politicians as an assault on national dignity mexico s president josé lópez portillo claimed that he first learned of the fence from press reports calling the matter serious very serious and criticizing efforts to form walls of separation in the world no more walls lópez portillo said lópez portillo was right to fear a new era of geopolitical barrier building a quick survey of state department cables from the time reveal walls and fences going up in many places along borders in south africa india israel and northern ireland with much diplomatic energy spent on figuring out how to justify them according to the principles of international law the border lobby there existed in the mid 1970s a number of domestic constituencies in the united states pushing for more stringent border control of the kind that a razor sharp border fence might provide one was the ins itself which around 1973 had become more vocal in lobbying congress and the public to expand its power the service was notoriously corrupt involved in many of the illicit moneymaking operations associated with border crossing including migrant drug and sex trafficking operation clean sweep established by nixon s justice department in 1972 investigated hundreds of agents revealing widespread border patrol and ins involvement in selling immigration documents smuggling migrants and running drugs agents also arranged visits to mexican brothels for u s judges and congressmen and then used knowledge of such visits as kompromat to secure favorable rulings and votes operation clean sweep might have done to border patrol and the ins what the church committee later in the 1970s did to the cia and fbi reveal to the public rogue operations engaged in widespread systemic abuse it didn t the inquiry was sidelined when as reported by new york times s john crewdson it turned up damaging information on rep peter rodino an ins official described by an informant as the service s chief pimp whose job was to get u s officials laid in mexico had reportedly arranged for rodino to visit a juárez brothel a new jersey democrat rodino was as crewdson wrote too powerful a figure to bring down he not only chaired the house judiciary committee which oversaw the ins but was in charge of the impeachment vote against nixon nixon resigned in april 1974 and clean sweep was shut down for good hundreds of agents had been investigated for every federal crime as its lead investigator alan murray put it except bank robbery few were indicted rather than facing constraints on their activities as the cia and fbi soon would border patrol and the ins s power only increased their budgets and staff grew and new laws were passed giving them even more enforcement authority and giving corrupt agents what in effect was a federally funded monopoly advantage as they competed with mexican criminals over the routes used to traffic migrants and drugs a second constituency for border militarization came from vietnam era research and development firms founded in 1966 potomac research the designer of the controversial fence was one of many companies looking to keep signing federal contracts in the wake of the vietnam drawdown war technology is americanized wrote david rorvik in playboy in 1974 of the move to use vietnam weapons and surveillance equipment for domestic policing sylvania electronics successfully pushed for its ground sensors developed as part of defense secretary robert mcnamara s multibillion dollar project to build a physical and electronic fence separating north from south vietnam to be used on the border vietnam s 3250 million automated battlefield is coming home to america

the same anti infiltration barrier used by the military to detect troop and truck movements on the ho chi minh trail a third group that wanted less mexican migration was organized labor including both the afl cio and the united farm workers since it applied downward pressure on wages for its part the ufw largely unprotected by new deal labor laws guaranteeing the right to form unions feared the use of undocumented workers as strikebreakers for about three months in 1975 writes frank bardacke in trampling out the vintage cesar chavez and the two souls of the united farm workers an extralegal ufw border patrol comprised of between 35 and 300 people paid 10 a day hunted illegals near yuma arizona with federal border patrol agents and local police officers happy to turn migrant interdiction into an intra racial conflict and elected politicians both law and order republicans and reform democrats allied with organized labor supported increased border control in 1978 the unreconstructed new york city liberal james scheuer who like rep alexandria ocasio cortez today represented the bronx and queens called for a firm hard sealing of the border it was around this time that the verb to seal a phrase usually applied to more militarized war ravaged border zones like the one that separated israel from gaza or west from east berlin began to be applied to the u s mexico border earlier in 1964 democrats pushed for the end of the guest worker bracero program and in 1965 for an unrealistically low quota on the number of visas available to mexico and in 1974 none other than rodino working with sen edward kennedy sponsored legislation that would have made it illegal to hire undocumented migrants the bill passed in the house 336 30 but lost in the senate by 1978 no one wanted the controversy sparked by norris s confession that the fence was meant to maim but the idea of a fence itself was uncontroversial the new fences would be no more of a symbol of exclusion wrote the los angeles times than are the present barriers photo valente cotera ap cheap labor and cheap oil the weaponized fence was one complaint that lópez portillo the mexican president presented to carter when carter landed in mexico city on february 14 1979 another had to do with oil two momentous events preceded carter s visit first came the confirmation in early 1977 that mexico possessed much more petroleum in vast onshore and offshore fields than had heretofore been realized then on january 16 1979 shah mohammad reza pahlavi fled iran marking the triumph of that country s islamic revolution washington already had been pushing mexico before the shah s downfall to make up for the falling supply of persian gulf oil an alliance with the shah was key to washington s post vietnam pivot iran s ample supply of crude mitigated the worst effects of the ongoing energy crisis with the country s petrodollars either deposited in new york banks or spent lavishly on u s weapons in response to the crisis in iran which led to a drop in the nation s oil exports the carter administration began pressuring mexico in late 1978 to sell its fuel to the u s at below global market price mexico refused then just a few days before the story of the border fence s razor sharp design broke in the press the white house voided a deal to buy mexican natural gas the move was meant to force mexico to reconsider the asking price for its oil with a pipeline to the u s half finished where else was the country going to sell its gas mexico was left hanging like a paintbrush lópez portillo said mexico wasn t a member of the organization of petroleum exporting countries and its oligarchy and security forces were brutal to their own people but its political elite were heirs to the economic nationalism of the mexican revolution lópez portillo was something like the hugo chávez of his decade though more mannered petroleum he said was the patrimony of all of humanity and its profits should be used to finance the development of a more just international order access to cheap fuel and cheap labor are the two elements absolutely essential to the functioning of global capitalism though they aren t often linked together in discussions of foreign policy lópez portillo though in response to washington s demand that mexico serve as its private oil spigot repeatedly in discussions with china and japan even in sidebar talks with california s governor jerry brown emphasized the connection between energy and migration mexico s untapped oil reserves he said would help the country enter the coming century as a country that offers full employment to its people we either do that or we risk a full financial failure and suffer the humiliation of becoming a country of wetbacks other mexican policy and opinion makers made similar connections between petroleum production and migration one columnist warned of big trouble along the border were mexico to capitulate to washington and sell its fuel at below global market value economic inequality between the two countries would only grow worse he said predicting that by the year 2000 mexicans will flow into the u s at the rate of 5 million a year instead of the 1 million a year now mexico will eat its gas said a mexico city banker before it will sell it at less than 2 60 then the going global rate and so carter landed in mexico city on valentine s day to a cold welcome the airport reception was cordial but brief with lópez portillo using his lunchtime remarks to lecture his u s counterpart referring to the borderlands as scars lópez portillo complained of washington s sudden deception and abuse warning that manipulative policies on the part of the united states would only worsen the silent migration and deepen resentment and fear on both sides of the border newspapers reported that carter was stung by the criticisms to which he responded with a joke that didn t go over well he said he first started jogging during an earlier visit to mexico city when he discovered i was afflicted with montezuma s revenge terrorizing the borderlands carter s fence fiasco receded from public attention after his administration promised a scaled down humane design but the controversy along with diplomatic tensions over energy policy signaled a major realignment of politics on both sides of the border in the united states the rising chicano movement broke with the anti immigrant position of both the united farm workers and the middle class league of united latin american citizens which earlier had supported operation wetback as border patrol s mass deportation campaign of the 1950s was called activists mobilized against the fence and then against ins raids in east los angeles describing them as a form of domestic terrorism one ins officials admitted that the symbolic content of the green uniform worn by border patrol agents is very high sort of like showing a swastika in a synagogue soon both the united farm workers and lulac followed years later by the afl reversed their positions and began advocating on behalf of undocumented migrants immigration and naturalization service ins officers arrest migrants who had entered texas via mexico to seek asylum on feb 20 1989 photo walt frerck afp getty images the fence scandal likewise marked the growing importance of mexican migration to domestic electoral politics for instance sen ted kennedy in april 1980 shortly after announcing that he would challenge carter for the democratic party presidential nomination flew to mexico city to meet with lópez portillo kennedy had a few years earlier backed legislation meant to crack down on the hiring of undocumented workers now in mexico city he criticized carter s unilateral approach to border security and said that he favored an amnesty to legalize the status of undocumented residents in the united states there was the massachusetts senator believed a growing consensus within his country for such a solution electric fences he said are not the answer ronald reagan shortly after securing the republican nomination also jumped on both the fence controversy and the energy crisis you don t build a 9 foot fence along the border between two friendly nations he said on a campaign swing through texas in september 1980 you document the undocumented workers and let them come in here with a visa he continued and let them stay for whatever length of time they want to stay reagan quickly gave up the idea careful as he was to thread between the business and nativist wings of the republican party but he also in response to the united states s energy dispute with mexico put forward the first real proposal for what would evolve into the north american free trade agreement the details of reagan s north american accord were fuzzy and the final nafta treaty as negotiated by reagan s successor george h w bush and signed in late 1993 into law by bill clinton didn t include as reagan had suggested the integration of mexican u s and canadian fuel markets the agreement focused mostly on non energy related trade and investment but in the decades following ratification washington steadily pushed to break the mexican government s monopoly on oil and gas production that push was eventually successful with mexico s congress passing legislation in 2014 to open up its energy sector to u s corporations a move which hastened the worldwide decline of energy prices the cost of labor too remains cheap back in 1978 the country s roma era business elites in contrast to the public indignation voiced by mexico s politicians privately told u s diplomats that they supported the idea of a border fence so long as it was put up without fanfare a hardened border they hoped would keep their labor costs down and so after lópez portillo mexican presidents gave up the idea of creating a more just international order and instead promoted the opening of its economy while at the same time largely going along with washington s hardening of its border policy nafta freed investment and commodities allowing them to cross borders at will but the treaty didn t grant the same freedom to workers in fact the opposite occurred continued militarization of the border including the expansion of sharp edged sheet metal border fences that did sever body parts limited the range of movement allowed to mexican workers ensuring that mexico s comparative advantage for the u s economy low wages remained intact mexican wages today are among the lowest in the world significantly lower than for example in china meanwhile after the tortilla curtain controversy died down the border fence continued to expand including in the 1990s using the army corp of engineers to build 60 miles of fence out of old surplus steel landing pads that the military had used to land hercules cargo planes and huey helicopters in vietnam the pads included an anti climb guard that regularly severed the fingers of migrants those pads are now considered obsolete though many are still in place in california new mexico and arizona and u s border policy is weaponized beyond anything imaginable to 1970s era engineers in the last months of barack obama s presidency the migrants rights organizations no more deaths and la coalición de derechos humanos produced a series of harrowing reports examining how border patrol treats the borderlands as a low intensity war zone where federal agents commit violence with impunity border patrollers often violently tackle nonresisting migrants and beat those they catch gratuitously destroying sources of drinking water and denying humanitarian aid habitual acts of cruelty by agents are entirely consistent with the logic and objectives of deterrence one of the reports states which are premised on amplifying the risks and harms inflicted on border crossers in order to deter future crossing attempts agents regularly use helicopters and terrain vehicles to scatter border crossers chasing them over cliffs into fast flowing rivers or deeper into the desert many as a result die from exhaustion of dehydration or simply disappear the borderlands have been transformed into a vast graveyard of the missing

there is a brazen bipartisan push by the u s government for regime change in venezuela with the trump administration officially declaring opposition leader juan guaidó as the legitimate president the economic sanctions imposed on venezuela by the u s are aimed at starving the population into submission with notorious neoconservatives john bolton and elliott abrams coordinating the campaign to overthrow the government of nicolás maduro what we are witnessing right now in latin america is a modern iteration of the same dirty tactics that the u s has historically used against the nations south of the u s border venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world the u s has tried since the early 2000s to overthrow its socialist government beginning with hugo chávez at the same time it poured money into right wing movements and backed open fascists like jair bolsonaro of brazil all of this is a modern version of the era of overthrowing leftists who won at the ballot box or by ousting u s friendly dictators and all of the mass murder the sanctions the regime changes the election interference the covert support for anti democratic forces determined to be good for so called free markets is today as it was in the 1950s sold in the name of bringing freedom and democracy powerful democrats and republicans alike have sold the notion that economic sanctions are somehow a cleaner way of forcing change than military action they portray sanctions as targeting the dictators the oligarchs the criminally corrupt but the filthy truth is that not all sanctions are created equal yes there are sanctions that go after individual criminals but the sanctions we re talking about on venezuela right now are not going harm maduro and his inner circle personally no these sanctions are aimed at punishing the venezuelan people by depriving them of food medicine wages and their very humanity the strategy is to use these sanctions as a cudgel against an already suffering people in a campaign to torture them into submission the former u s ambassador to venezuela william brownfield has been aggressively lobbying for more sanctions saying perhaps the best solution would be to accelerate the collapse he says this while actually openly acknowledging that sanctions will kill innocent people increase malnutrition and bring fairly severe punishment for millions and millions of venezuelans brownfield recently admitted the following if we can do something that will bring that end quicker we probably should do it but we should do it understanding that it s going to have an impact on millions and millions of people who are already having great difficulty finding enough to eat getting themselves cured when they get sick or finding clothes to put on their children before they go off to school we don t get to do this and pretend as though it has no impact there we have to make the hard decision the desired outcome justifies this fairly severe punishment this is the former u s ambassador to venezuela speaking at a washington d c think tank publicly saying that it is worth the price of lives and health and humanity of ordinary venezuelans in order to overthrow a government the u s does not like these sanctions are going to cost venezuela 11 billion in oil revenue in 2019 alone that amounts to nearly 95 percent of the money that venezuela spent on the import of food and other goods last year this isn t targeting maduro even the economist stated the following about the logic behind the sanctions mr guaidó and mr trump are betting that hardship will topple the regime before it starves the venezuelan people that s not chávez speaking from the grave that s the economist when powerful political leaders in the u s want to change governments the price of killing innocent people is always worth it it s the american way and this is why trump is being embraced on his venezuela policy he is promoting and advancing the bipartisan politics of empire it is the same dynamic when the so called adults on capitol hill support giving trump sweeping surveillance powers or unending funds for an already insane military spending budget for all the screaming about trump being a grave threat to democracy the worst president ever or an unhinged maniac when he boosts the policies of imperialism he gets to join the club of the cops of the world on intercepted this week historian and journalist vijay prashad joined us to discuss the state of imperialism in the world the situation in venezuela the upcoming elections in india and the recent one in the democratic republic of congo prashad is a writing fellow and chief correspondent at globetrotter that s a project of the independent media institute he is the executive director of the tricontinental institute for social research and the chief editor of leftword books prashad is a prolific writer authoring 25 books including the darker nations a people s history of the third world and the poorer nations a possible history of the global south an excerpt of this conversation aired on intercepted what follows is the complete unedited conversation this interview begins at 20 03 jeremy scahill vijay prashad welcome to intercepted vijay prashad thank you so much js vijay i want to start by asking your response to the recent developments in venezuela earlier this week the new york times did a big profile on the opposition leader juan guaidó who has declared himself president and the times notes that more than 20 countries have now recognized guaidó as the legitimate interim president of venezuela among those countries the united states canada most of south america then on monday several european union countries that list among them france germany britain spain austria sweden and denmark you recently wrote that what happened to chile in 1973 when there was a u s initiated coup against the democratically elected leader salvador allende is precisely what the united states has attempted to do in many countries of the global south and you say the most recent target for the u s government and western big business is venezuela what are the parallels that you see between the overthrow of allende in 1973 and what we re seeing now with the push to overthrow nicolas maduro of venezuela vp i m glad we re starting here jeremy because this is really the most important issue i think of our period which is you know this very extravagant set of claims made by particularly the united states and its closest allies about countries in the global south whether it s iran or venezuela or a host of other countries let s think about the chilean example in 1970 when salvador allende was coming close to winning a very legitimate election to come to office the united states government said we will not tolerate it if people like allende decide to nationalize resources in the case of chile it was copper and so they began to plan to in a way undermine allende through barricading his economy long before allende even won the election and after he won the election they did everything possible to prevent chile from selling copper outside its boundaries therefore bankrupting chile creating distress within the country and then winking to the military to take over and by the way chile is not the beginning of this we saw this in 1954 in guatemala where the issue was the nationalization of the united fruit company and we saw this in 1953 in iran when the issue was oil the government of mohammad mossadegh nationalized the oil company this was something seen as totally inappropriate by western oil companies the so called seven sisters and the united states in alliance with great britain conducted a coup against mohammad mossadegh in iran and against jacobo árbenz in guatemala i mean there so many examples of precisely this situation with venezuela just very quickly it s got to be said that this is a country that has never been able to diversify its economy about 98 percent of its external revenues comes from oil and from petroleum products in the last few years oil prices have collapsed by 50 percent which means that venezuela s external revenues have also collapsed by about 50 percent when venezuela was swimming in oil money and when there were difficulties in the united states and britain and other countries the venezuelan government provided cheap oil to poor people in boston in the bronx in new york in the aftermath of hurricane katrina in london and other places but when venezuela went into a crisis rather than tending to the problem which was basically a problem of a one commodity economy rather than help the venezuelans what we begin to see is the obama administration in 2015 declaring venezuela a national security threat and now the trump administration with the very close help of mr trudeau from canada trying to essentially overthrow the government of mr nicolas maduro you know the people will concentrate and they ll say well you know maduro did this maduro did that but before maduro can do anything is the suffocation of the one commodity economy js well and vijay you have this exception in the sanctions the latest round of sanctions that the trump administration has imposed on venezuela and its state oil company allowing chevron to continue doing business as usual and also the former company of dick cheney halliburton also allowed to continue on in venezuela vp see one of the interesting things about the trump administration and trump s national security adviser john bolton is they just don t seem to care i mean they don t have any pretense about anything that they re doing whereas one saw even with george w bush s administration we saw some measure of pretense you know they d come up with theories about humanitarianism and whatever it is there weapons of mass destruction all kinds of shifting goal posts that they used as a fig leaf for the invasion of iraq even of course with mr obama we saw all kinds of high minded principles obama was an expert at concocting high minded principles to defend essentially naked aggression with trump and with bolton i mean we re at a situation where they just don t care include with trump and bolton senator rubio they just don t care they come out directly and say we re in this for the oil they come out directly and say these people can t behave like that i mean of all audacious things nicolas maduro is a bus driver you know how dare he be the president of a country you should be an oligarch one of the old aristocracy from venezuela that s the kind of person that should run things in collaboration with chevron and halliburton and so on so you know they re not even to pretend that this is about democracy js briefly vijay you also have many prominent democrats including dick durbin of illinois but also members of the democratic side of the house foreign relations committee backing the trump administration and over the weekend we saw huge protests in venezuela the ones that were in support of juan guaidó were covered everywhere and the footage was shown everywhere but the massive protests that were venezuelans in the streets to defend maduro that was not shown or there were allegations oh they re just doctoring the video so it s clear that we are seeing a major propaganda push on the one hand in the news media with glowing coverage of juan guaidó and then on the other hand democrats who are screaming on the top of the hill that donald trump is the biggest threat ever to american democracy and he s going to ruin the country the democrats on this issue are saying oh no but we were actually with trump on this one and nicolas maduro has to go vp the american political establishment makes a big deal of bipartisanship and in a sense the real arena where bipartisanship can be seen is when it comes to foreign policy particularly the behavior of the united states government against its so called adversaries whether it s iran or it s venezuela you know people get confused on iran thinking that the obama administration was on one side of the issue and trump was on the other in fact they were both on the same side of the issue which is that the united states has the right to intervene to pressure iran to use its various controls of things like the control of the u s dollar trade with iran to use pressure on the europeans against the swift network that s the network that moves currency around both obama and trump are in agreement that it s perfectly permissible for the u s to use any instrument to control iran there was some difference in strategy obama wanted to use the multilateral agreement that would essentially prevent iran from doing certain things and trump said no let s go a different way but they totally agreed in the final aim and in the attitude of the united states to other countries in foreign policy much the same in venezuela there is no difference in attitude across the political spectrum from democrats to republicans to the new york times you know utter unanimity of opinion that the united states can interfere in another country s political matters can come in and in fact anoint leaders here s the irony you have a country the united states which is up in arms about russian interference in the elections i can t watch rachel maddow s television show any longer because there she is going on and on about you know how the russians are doing this the russians are doing that meanwhile the united states is there openly brazenly intervening in venezuela as they do in so many other countries and these people have no problem with it i mean you know rachel maddow ph d from i think oxford have some decency at least let the goose and the gander be treated by the same standard but that is just not going to happen in fact things are so bad jeremy that when medea benjamin went in twice to intervene to shame the organization of american states and to shame people anointed by this lima group as representatives of venezuela cnn spanish used footage of medea to make the case that she was protesting on behalf of the opposition against maduro so not only do they frame these issues in a way that s quite you know just inconsiderate of the truth but here they are openly lying js well let me ask you i of course agree with your analysis on the u s intervention but we are seeing millions of venezuelans over the past several years fleeing the country yes the opposition some elements of the opposition to maduro have killed people there has been racist action on the part of some sectors of the opposition at the same time maduro controls most of the state mechanisms of organized violence the police the military etcetera and we have seen real brutality and lethal force used over and over on the opposition my question for you is and i ve been hearing this from venezuelans who say look we are not trump supporters we are not fans of any kind of a lighter skinned venezuelans are the one that should be in control of the country mentality that seems to be permeating a lot of the so called opposition but maduro is running the country into the ground yes we understand sanctions everything vijay is saying we agree with that at the same time maduro has built himself a kleptocracy are you saying that there is no legitimacy whatsoever to any sector of the opposition against maduro right now vp well look let s put it this way there are obvious problems as i said when your revenues declined to almost 50 percent you re going to suffer great problems inside the country you ve got an economic stranglehold by the sanctions regime and so on yes there are venezuelans fleeing the country but jeremy there are 69 million people who have been displaced around the world and that s a very conservative figure largely displaced because of the very structural policies that are disturbing countries not only venezuela but countries across west africa in central asia you have wars you have economic policies that are displacing people so of course there are people moving you know of course there are people who feel that this government is not representing them but that s what the political process is about i mean are we saying that nicolas maduro is a dictator now in the last election which the opposition only partly boycotted he only won 67 percent of the vote you know if this was truly a dictatorship let s look at the case of our old friend you know hosni mubarak in egypt mubarak won almost 90 percent of the votes that s questionable election and when that election took place the u s state department said this is a new day for egypt in this case maduro won 67 percent the opposition is politically divided it s not able to come together one section of the opposition has turned to the united states and said essentially give us a hand to use any means to overthrow this guy why don t you build the opposition on any day in caracas jeremy you open the newspapers they re all deeply critical of the maduro government if this is a dictatorship i don t understand what freedom you know in our limited sense is he gets hammered on television he is getting hammered the newspapers the fact is the opposition is not able to come together and the deep residues of chavista loyalty to the maduro government but also to the institutions of the missions and so on is not to be set aside in other words you have this very loyal section of chavistas who are committed to the bolivarian revolution they understand the problems they re willing to fight to defend the government and they come out in large numbers to vote for the government but yet their large numbers as i said amount to 67 percent there is a political process maduro has said let s go back let s have a negotiation let s think about a new election you know the venezuelan government in this last election last year asked the united nations to send monitors why did the united nations not send monitors you know why is the united states government attempting to cripple the political process in venezuela to create the preconditions where you can then think there s nothing else to be done except u s intervention to anoint somebody as the president a deeply undemocratic act js also i wanted to point out and you ve been writing about this and offering analysis on it that at this moment in latin america you have this rise again of overt authoritarian fascist leaders like jair bolsonaro of brazil but you also have a leftist president who came to power in mexico andres manuel lópez obrador known by his initials amlo and you wrote about lópez obrador that he comes to the presidency as a man of the left but the space for maneuvering that he has for a left agenda is minimal i feel like if this was 10 years ago there would have been a lot more excitement about what s happening in mexico with lópez obrador coming to power but that has sort of been drowned out by the situation in venezuela on the one hand and then trump s inane dangerous threats about building a border wall and then also the active ongoing threat of separating families from their children militarizing the border patrol ice which serves as a kind of storm front for enforcement of extremely racist xenophobic immigration policy but what is your sense of what room to maneuver lópez obrador has right now in mexico vp you see mexico like venezuela like any of these countries their space for what we call fiscal creativity is almost zero these countries are reliant upon borrowing commercial capital going to you know private banks to raise money there s been immense pressure on these countries from the imf not to run deficits so that means that if you can t raise enough money from banks to cover your basic running operation of your government what you re going to do is you re going to end up cutting social services i mean let s put this in some context jeremy oxfam s recent report showed that last year that is in the calendar year of 2018 2 230odd billionaires increased their wealth by 2 5 billion dollars per year and meanwhile the lowest 50 percent of humanity lost eleven percent of its wealth why am i raising this the top 10 people among those 2 230 odd billionaires of them there s only one person who s not from north america that is not from the united states and from europe and that person is carlos slim of mexico you see what we have to remember is the very top people these 2 000 odd billionaires and their families no longer pay tax you know they are essentially bloating tax havens they are hiding their money in banks they re just not paying tax anymore they have gone on what i consider a tax strike because these elites like carlos slim of mexico have gone on a tax strike the governments of countries like mexico have a very difficult time raising financing to do anything on the humane side of government policy so they ve been cutting health care they ve been cutting education they ve been slicing everything that produces civilization so for you know for lópez obrador the government he s inherited is basically a government which doesn t have any ability to provide the good parts of life for people which is why he was very eager to take back control of pemex which is the mexican petroleum company take back control of it put some money to invest in it to revive pemex the moment he made those comments after he won the election he was told directly by banks by the imf and by international oil companies that don t you dare do that don t you dare try to use public financing to revive pemex the only thing we re going to allow you to do is to basically sell more parts of pemex off to international privately held you know energy companies so what s happening to venezuela is just a much more vulgar and dangerous kind of portfolio of events than what is happening to mexico where things are not yet at a boiling point but basically lópez obrador has been told there is no exit for mexico no way for you to raise finances to basically enrich the population and therefore you re going to see people continue to move towards the border you re going to see people continue to move put pressure on the united states to build these walls and to create essentially a military force that stands there the border and shoots at people js now let s jump to the other side of the globe for a moment one of the major areas of focus of the trump administration that i think has the potential to be the most dangerous is the obsession with iran and the fact that the trump administration is littered with people including notorious neocons who have always wanted regime change in iran you have the situation in yemen which the trump administration has used as really a proxy war against iran and of course there s a lot of issues with facts in this administration and certainly that s been the case in yemen but you do have yemen being used as a proxy war you have this network of allies that s emerged where you have the saudis israel the united states and then some lesser states that really seem to be pushing in that direction the u s has been quietly negotiating with the iraqi government to have hundreds of special operations forces troops from the united states deployed inside of iraq with the purpose of potentially striking against iran how do you see the fact that trump is saying that he s going to take u s troops out of syria take u s troops out of afghanistan but now re deploy some of the most elite hunter killer teams in the u s arsenal in iraq with the explicit purpose of number one confronting iran and then secondarily dealing with isis vp well trump made a comment to cbs news where he said that we have american troops in iraq to monitor iran the word he used was monitor and within hours the iraqi prime minister made a comment saying you know this is inappropriate that the united states presence in iraq is to combat terrorism not to essentially rattle the cage with iran because we that is the iraqi government have a relationship both with the iranians and the united states so again trump no ability to hold back just says things openly and the contradictions then emerge on the world stage i think the united states is going to have a very difficult time using iraq as a lily pad using any of the neighboring states apart from those that you mentioned that is saudi arabia the uae these states would be quite happy to help but remember saudi arabia cannot have american troops located there so i don t know what kind of practical support the turks are not going to allow troops to come in so it s going to be very difficult for the united states practically to take on iran apart from you know occasional bombing runs maybe and one or two special forces people going in to do sabotage operations you know when nicolas maduro was under immense pressure he made a little video where he warned the american don t come and invade us we ll make this another vietnam i want you to consider jeremy that the population of iraq is just about 40 percent of the population of iran the iranian population is highly motivated if the united states decided to do any kind of military action against iran it would i think be a great mistake i mean maduro evokes vietnam i would also evoke vietnam at a different scale for the for the iranian situation i think that they are trying to intimidate the iranian government and they re trying to do something which this is why the playbook between iran and venezuela is the same they re trying to produce so much you know economic hardship in the country that you re going to have millions of people get disaffected with the government you will have immense propaganda saying that it is this government s fault and not these other external policies and you will try to create some kind of internal uprising which then gets cracked down upon by the government because it naturally doesn t want to have some internal uprising you know just continue and moment that crackdown takes place the united states is going to say to the europeans look they are authoritarian they re a dictatorship they re crushing their people let s go in and nato is going to say yes and they go in you know all guns blazing it s an incredibly similar playbook that they are following in all these countries which is why these countries are all sort of you know in a similar way concerned i think it s silly how people talk about the axis of resistance and so on i don t think anything like that exists these countries have very different approaches to foreign policy but at the same time since they re all under the same kind of playbook there s a kind of sympathy in these capitals for what s happening in each place and i think this is also why the russians are very keen to be involved in each of these places to provide a shield i think the question of a russian shield over iran is already there the issue of a russian shield over venezuela is also there and i would say jeremy this is exactly the reason why the united states has withdrawn from the missile treaty this is why the united states is going to try directly to undermine russian military power in the next few months js well but in fairness russia has its own imperial agenda as well it s not like russia is only acting in the human interest of the world i mean russia clearly is facing down nato encroachment on the part of the united states the u s moving further and further to the east you have the potential and it s been there for some time to have an all out hot war between u s and russian forces in syria certainly that would be the case if the u s did escalate even a little bit in iran but let s be clear here though i mean russia is not an ideological actor trying to stand up for the global south they re also acting on their own imperial interests that occasionally aligned with the agenda that you re describing there vp well i would say stronger than that i wouldn t use the word imperial i would say russia is entirely a defensive power why do i say that you know it s interesting when you look at military bases particularly naval bases the united states has a hundred and some odd naval bases around the world in fact has the ability to encircle the planet years ago i was talking to a senior u n official this is in march of 2011 when the security council was debating u n resolution 1973 that was the resolution that allowed the war in libya and i asked the u n official i said you know it s so funny you guys you produce these resolutions which say any member state can act under chapter seven which means any member state can use armed forces to defend you know to help this resolution along and of course that means the united states because who else has bases all over the world you know the indians can t intervene in libya and so on well the russians had only not a hundred naval bases around the world but they had two warm water bases and i think it s important to underline this one warm water base was in sevastopol in the crimea and the second warm water base is in latakia in syria it s no secret therefore that from 2013 14 the russians were terrified about losing the sevastopol naval base and the intervention into ukraine particularly into crimea i think this is the reason for the intervention to crimea they were defending that warm water base and secondly in2015 in september when russian planes entered damascus and they intervened militarily to prevent an american bombing run on the city it was to defend their naval base in latakia so what i would say is that it s an entirely defensive power it s much weaker than the united states but it s basically using military force and using you know its ability as limited as possible to secure these alliances it s not out there to defend the south i totally agree with that but it has its own agenda and these agendas contradict those of the united states at present what s interesting about this agenda that the russians have is that from let s say the u s invasion of panama in 1989 to the attempted overthrow of the syrian government in 2012 13 i think in that space there was no check on u s power and when the russian planes entered syria in 2015 that was the first time in about you know almost 25 years that somebody had come in to check u s power and it s my feeling that this current tussle over missile defense over space overall these kinds of new tensions around military hardware the presence of the military etcetera between the united states and russia is to once again weaken the russian ability to provide these shields these shields are not there for humanitarian purposes but nonetheless these are shields js now you mentioned india there and i want to remind people that india is a massive country not just in land mass but in population upwards of 1 3 billion people like what you know we re talking about like one in every six people in the world is from india and india has very very important elections that will be coming up in the spring scheduled for may right now india is under the control of a far right extremist the bjp won the majority in india s parliament i want to ask you about the resistance to narendra modi in a second and what your analysis is of the upcoming elections there and there been huge protests and you ve been tweeting about that and showing pictures and videos but first explain for people the impact that the far right bjp government has had on india vp well jeremy in 2013 when the last parliamentary elections took place the far right won 31 percent of the vote but because of the nature of the indian parliamentary system they got a majority in parliament but i want to start there because people should understand that they are essentially a minority government in terms of the votes they were able to get even though mr modi rules india as if he had won a major majority of the population s favor you know 60 percent plus of the public did not vote for the bjp or its allies i think that s very important to remember nonetheless mr modi didn t govern as if he represented india he governed from the agenda of his political party he attempted to push the fascistic agenda of the bjp in terms of what does it mean to be an indian no longer does the bjp want india to be composite plural country as you say 1 3 1 4 billion people you know with let me say you know a hundred tens of hundreds of different kinds of cultural worlds over a hundred different kinds of languages highly diverse population yet more they wanted to govern it in a very narrow suffocating cultural way he also attempted certain dramatic economic you know let s call them gimmicks demonetization which meant that suddenly one day you wake up and two of your main currency bills have been withdrawn from circulation this was supposedly to go after black money you know that is money hoarded by the rich of course the rich no longer keep their hoarded money in bank accounts under their beds they keep it in tax havens in shelters all around the world so this was a big gimmick which backfired created a lot of distress for people and so on so modi attempted to push the country in a rightward direction but right from the beginning there was immense resistance against him and interestingly even on foreign policy when modi tried to move into basically the american camp he was prevented he was the first indian prime minister to go to israel but he was forced by the political class and by the indian foreign ministry to also have continued relations with the palestinians which he wanted to break modi was very eager to join in the american project to isolate iran that was prevented not only by the foreign ministry and by the other political parties but also of course by the needs of india which is entirely reliant on import of oil and imports quite a large amount of iranian oil in the case of venezuela there was pressure on mr modi to join with some of these european countries and the lima group to isolate the government of maduro but the political class just wouldn t have it and india had to put out a quite a strong statement saying that no foreign intervention is permitted and the sovereignty of venezuela must be respected so i want to just say at the same time as modi is quite a ruthless nasty piece of work he was not able to capture fully the institutions of indian government and the imagination of the indian people and it s quite likely jeremy that he is going to lose this election quite badly js well that s interesting i want to ask you more about that i also want to just draw people s attention to the fact that just last month in january there were upwards of 200 million workers in india that took part in a two day strike protesting the government s labor policies and then at the same time over the weekend you tweeted a photo of a sea of people in red and you wrote the following my home city of kolkata bristled today with the energy of the left front with our comrades thronging the brigade ground there are many photographs of our comrades as they interact with each other dance with each other from the bus stands and the train stations to the maidan what is the left front and how are they challenging the bjp vp well you know it s let s begin with the major labor protest i was driving up and down the length of kerala during those two days of the strike in january js i mean that s just for people to understand i mean 200 million workers i mean that s like two thirds of the population of the united states in you know in the streets on strike vp that s quite right and these are workers from not only where you d expect them rail workers people closed down the trains in different parts of the country but also anganwadi workers these are workers who are child care workers asha workers these are health care workers went out on strike we saw it workers the internet workers in bangalore in some it companies go on strike it was a range of workers to add up to 200 million and these workers were on strike not for wages i think that s very important to recognize but they were angry with the direction of economic policy they were angry with the kind of political culture in the country it s a very broad set of demands and quite a very powerful strike but before that last year there was an immense wave of agrarian struggles people may not know that in the past 18 years almost 300 000 indian farmers have committed suicide they ve committed suicide largely because there is a deep agrarian crisis with no exit that has struck india you ve had because of the commercialization of agriculture you ve had input prices rise prices of fertilizer prices of pesticide prices of seeds and you ve had the government cut support prices to buy the goods that means that the input prices risen and the buying price has dropped which has left farmers in immense debt and what you ve seen which is so tragic is many of these farmers commit suicide by drinking pesticide the very thing that has bankrupted them well over the course of these 15 odd years the kisan sabha which is the farmers movement in india has been struggling very hard to build the political confidence of farmers and you saw in bombay last year you know hundreds of thousands of farmers march for over two weeks into the city of bombay and force the right wing state government to accede to the demands so what i m saying is that we move from suicide to the politicization of the agrarian crisis this had an enormous impact in three state elections last year in the states of rajasthan madhya pradesh and chhattisgarh and it s because of this farmer s protest which has been you know organized by the left by the communists by the socialists and other constituents of the left front because of these farmer s protest you ve seen a shift in the political needle away from the bjp in these key states of rajasthan madhya pradesh chhattisgarh and in the very large the largest state in india the state of uttar pradesh where there are 80 members of parliament you know the parliament in india has about 500 members 80 of them come from uttar pradesh in the 2013 election modi s party won 70 of those seats but this year the two i mean so called socialist parties the samajwadi party and the bahujan samaj party have united they are going to fight the elections together and it s actually a marriage that is made in heaven as they say because in 31 seats in the 2013 election in 31 of those seats the samajwadi party the socialist party came second and in 34 seats the bahujan samaj party which is the party of oppressed castes came second so that means they don t actually compete with each other in 65 of the seats where the bjp won so what we are anticipating is that this alliance is going to win about 50 to 60 seats out of 80 uttar pradesh because the bjp cannot win seats in south india because it s going to have a hard time in those agrarian states of chhattisgarh rajasthan and madhya pradesh and because it s going to lose in this very large state of uttar pradesh to this new alliance of socialists and oppressed caste parties because of that there is no way bjp is going to get a plurality in the parliament and i think in fact it will it will not be able to form a government in april and may of this coming this year js what are the chances that a new indian government would be legitimately leftist or anti imperialist vp no no no i mean jeremy that s not the js i m asking you brother vp you see the issue is this is the situation that we are going to face for a generation which is that again in these three state elections it was really immense work done by the left among you know rural communities farmers landless workers and so on to build a political momentum that defeated the bjp governments but of course the left doesn t have the kind of political structure needed to win elections you know whether this is in brazil or it s in india we have to recognize that democracy has been completely shattered as an institutional form it requires so much money to run in elections there are so many crooked things that have happened to the democratic process you know in brazil jair bolsonaro s friends were sending whatsapp messages to whatsapp groups that number you know hundreds and thousands of people these whatsapp messages that were very cruel they were suggesting that the workers party in brazil you know was going to force their children into sex education and so on you know as if that s a problem i mean children deserve sex education but they were doing it in an extremely nasty way and delegitimizing the workers party in brazil we see the same thing in india in other words you know lots of money being put by corporations into bjp deniable groups that are creating these whatsapp networks and you know inking essentially the political process by you know saying things about other candidates that are not true where it s very difficult for the candidate who doesn t have money to come out there and say look that s just not true and let me show you how so you know to capitalize on the kind of mass mobilizations on the struggles and so on into this democratic sphere is becoming increasingly difficult which is why i think that you know we need to very seriously consider reconsider what democratic institutions are and what has become what has happened to them js last month was the anniversary of the assassination of patrice lumumba the independence leader in congo who was the first prime minister of the independent democratic republic of congo he was assassinated and the united states we know for a fact had previously plotted to assassinate him just recently there were elections in congo and you had the election of felix tshisekedi he is now congo s fifth president taking over from joseph kabila you recently with kambale musavuli wrote a piece about the legacy of the crisis in congo and how patrice lumumba inspired youth are trying to break the culture of plunder and corruption that has been foisted upon the political system in congo explain today s crisis how it began in congo the significance of this new election and the fact that the so called opposition in congo right now is headed by a former exxonmobil executive vp you know it s a great tragedy and i d like to just back up for a minute it s not just a situation of the congo you have to look at this belt that runs through the center of africa including zambia you know including any country in the center of africa and the many of them that are rich in rare earth minerals in various raw materials from cobalt which is an essential ingredient in electric batteries to coltan which is essential for you know the smartphones the iphone and so on so these countries js oh many many people are probably listening to you right now vijay on devices that contain some natural resources from congo or this belt that you re describing vp well they will definitely have devices that have cobalt and coltan which mainly come from this belt of countries and it s very important to say that however much there is kind of this dismay about the chinese intervention in africa that actually most of the companies that are able to work to mine these goods are actually not chinese many of them are canadian we in fact are doing a study about these canadian firms like barrick and so on which dominate the mining in these parts of the world and what you ve seen is that these mining companies essentially misprice what they re doing they pay these countries revenues based on a very deflated price for the goods these goods as soon as they cross the border from the congo say they go to mwanza port in tanzania as soon as they cross the border into tanzania or into uganda the prices of these goods rise by miracle because within the congo they keep the price low so they say to the government we ll give you 20 percent per ton of coltan s price but the price is you know only so many hundred dollars as soon as it crosses the border the price increases this is what we call mispricing so places like the congo have essentially been plundered and stolen from for over a hundred years they haven t been able to build up any kind of public finances they haven t been able to build up proper institutions to take care of the people of the congo or of zambia wherever and what you see in the congo is i mean you cannot imagine what corruption looks like it s the corruption of these big canadian and other mining companies resource companies australian companies and so on then it s the corruption of the political class at this moment the kind of tentacles of joseph kabila who governed you know almost entirely since democracy came to congo i mean democracy again that word you know what does it mean for places like the congo where you know you strong arm people you have elections which means so little and bizarrely elections which means so little but in the case of a place like the congo because it s pliant because it allows its raw materials and rare earth materials to leave the country at low cost every time there is an election the state department and you know all the europeans everybody says well you know they re moving towards democracy i mean if you are a pliant government then your stolen election is validated if you are not a pliant government this is coming back to venezuela then you re going to be told your election was fraudulent so they have had fraudulent election after elections and it got to such a point that joseph kabila simply refused to have an election you know his term ended in 2016 he just refused to allow an election to take place and nobody said peep there was no statement about moving american troops into tanzania i mean nothing why because essentially all the minerals are being looted from that country so that we can have iphones which cost okay the huge price of 999 dollars but if you actually priced the minerals inside the iphone the price may go up to 30 000 per iphone some people have estimated 100 000 per iphone imagine that walking into the apple store and saying i ll take three of those i mean who can afford that so as long as you have a pliant government and kabila was pliant they allowed him to keep going even though his mandate ended in 2016 you had these massive protest yes lumumba inspired youth but also you know some of them are devout christian groups and so on out on the street demanding change the pressure was too high they allowed an election they thought that kabila s you know his successor would come in and here s the whole trick of it you know again what is a democracy who can afford to build a political party necessarily you get people from the elite who build the opposition and here yes of course it s an exxonmobil you know executive who becomes the face of the opposition i mean there is no real opposition in a country like congo until it s built from the grassroots from these young people and so on and that is why jeremy i m sorry to say that for at least a generation places like the congo will not be able to have you know robust political movements movements that will have any kind of impact in the electoral domain in zambia a socialist party is being built up particularly in the copper belt they are going to run for presidential elections the candidate is going to be fredman membe fred used to run a newspaper in zambia he has been arrested several times by this government his newspaper has been confiscated the press was confiscated the men s pressure against the socialist party of zambia and i can bet you that 99 percent of the people listening to this have never heard of the socialist party of zambia or of fred you know because of course these are people who will not be pliant when it comes to mining companies if they ever come to power js well and i also want to remind people just briefly of the history that you re talking about here of the congo which was under the brutal reign of belgian colonialism and then you had the cia backed government of mobutu sese seko and he himself was an actual cia asset who ran that country with extreme brutality and kept it open for u s president after u s president you also had dwight eisenhower authorizing the cia to develop a chemical poison that was made to look like toothpaste that they wanted to try to assassinate patrice lumumba with we ve seen so many of these independence movements or nationalist movements in africa and asia around the global south just be completely obliterated or severely damaged in the ensuing decades of imperialist encroachment around the world vp well it is a very great tragedy i mean again the playbook is similar you look for the most charismatic person assassinate that person and then squeeze the rest of the political forces into exceeding to your demands i mean you take the case of any of these countries when they attempted to do something put forward an alternative project suddenly there s an assassination whether it s patrice lumumba in the congo in 1961 or it s amílcarcabral or it s the coup against kwame nkrumah i mean none of them was allowed to have a tenure where they were able to develop independent economies and of course for my generation the assassination of thomas sankara in may of 1987 the very charismatic and important political leader in burkina faso which used to be known as upper volta but then when sankara came to power he changed the name of his country said why should we be called upper volta why should we be defined by colonialism we are burkina faso the land of upright people and he pushed an agenda to revive the agriculture of burkina faso he pushed an agenda for the sovereignty of the country it s such an interesting agenda that he pushed that he set for instance by government fiat by law on wednesday men must do childcare he said i would like to have half the week be for men to do childcare and domestic take care of the house clean things cook food but i m going to start only with wednesday i mean this was a man who understood that political power is not about the parliament it s not even about the boardroom of companies it s the kitchen the house you know it s the old saying jeremy that it s not enough to be che guevara on the street and pinochet in the kitchen you have to be liberated person from you know your house out onto the streets and sankara pushed a great agenda for his country burkina faso and he was assassinated you know just seven years later the hope of south africa chris hani you know the leader of the leader of the urban poor in south africa just as south africa was coming out of apartheid before the elections chris hani was shot to death i mean every time you look at an african country when a young leader is produced that comes up with an agenda that is not blind to mining companies not pliant to the western capitals that person is killed almost immediately and i think people need to really reflect on that reflect on the assassinations of houari boumédièneat the north of the country in algeria all the way down to chris hani at the south js you know as we wrap up vijay i wanted to get your big picture take on the ascent of donald trump to the chamber of ultimate power in the united states at the white house taking into account this history that you and i are discussing of populist movements leftist movements socialist movements and the kind of expansion of the imperialism of the united states set donald trump s rise to power in the context of all of this history that you and i have been discussing vp well you know it brings us back to this tax strike that began about 40 years ago about 40 years ago when basically government policy allowed the big elites to no longer pay taxes corporate tax rates began to fall you saw government budgets desiccate you saw municipal budgets basically devolve to nothing at this point the kind of liberal consensus the liberal agenda was to move in a direction what we call neoliberalism they produced a policy framework called neoliberalism which basically accepted the fact that the rich were not going to pay taxes and they tried to raise public financing whether it s the budgets of governments or municipalities they wanted to raise funds by selling off hard won public assets whether it s concessions to water delivery or it s in fact education institutions and so on they privatized they opened up parts of human existence that had not been for money and commodified them so again water is a great example you had water utilities which basically ran things as a not for profit entity you start privatizing water making water into a commodity this was the way in which the liberals tried to finance this crisis of government budgets because the rich were not paying taxes and they were not going to challenge the rich in fact they said that s good it creates entrepreneurialism you see jobs trickle down essentially this is the agenda of tony blair of bill clinton and you know around the world they have their cognates but by the financial crisis of 2007 the liberals with the neoliberal policies were essentially totally delegitimized i mean nobody took seriously after the financial crisis the idea that you should just go out there and become an entrepreneur as if it s so easy i mean as if it s so easy to go out there and just start a business have an idea and somebody will finance it who who is going to finance it which bank is going to give me money for my idea when banks are basically hoarding wealth on behalf of the wealthy not lending for business purposes at the rates at which they should and so on so when these neoliberals are delegitimized from the right appears characters people like donald trump but again this is not a specific american story this is a global story the delegitimization of the liberals whether it s the congress party in india or it s to some extent the workers party in brazil the democratic party in the united states these far right people show up and they make strong claims saying that we re going to come we re going to grab the economy by the throat we re going to make it cough out jobs and then they make even more dramatic statement saying that the reason you don t have a job has nothing to do with the fact that you re not an entrepreneur or that you re not a get up and go person the reason you don t have a job is because the migrants because these migrants come in and take your jobs i mean it s a classic bait and switch on the one hand they quite correctly attack the neoliberals saying that you ve basically hollowed out the economy they attack them saying that you re not able to provide well being for the population well that s true but then the bait and switch is they turn around and they say the reason why this is happening is because of the migrants they in other words the trumps of the world just like the clintons of the world don t point their fingers at those 2 000 billionaires and so on who are just not paying taxes who are sucking up social wealth and not providing any return to public finances to improve health to improve education and by the way to create public institutions that prevent people from desperation like universal health care if you had publicly funded universal health care individual families wouldn t have to scramble to pay premiums and struggle to get health insurance and so on this is what public financing should have been but because the left is weak now the liberals have been delegitimized the field is open to the right and not only to the right but these very vicious strongmen so my sense is that for some time now we re going to have to tolerate this right wing political presence until we build up the forces of the left to produce a robust critique of the way in which the wealthy have not been contributing at all i mean i don t really want philanthropy i want them to pay taxes js well on that note we re going to leave it there vijay prashad thank you so much for joining us vp thanks a lot

greyerz western gold maginot line to fall in 2019 triggering panic plus one of the most shocking stories you will ever read as the world edges closer to the next crisis today the man who has become legendary for his predictions on qe and historic moves in currencies shared with king world news one of the most shocking stories you will ever read greyerz also warned the western gold maginot line will fall in 2019 triggering panic a change in the world for years to come february 10 king world news egon von greyerz there are critical moments in time that can change history this week i will talk about two lines which are extremely important as these two lines will change the world for years to come the first is a chinese line which is strongly linked to china s history that line has an important connection with what will happen in the world in coming years the second line is a gold maginot line which will also shape the world for many years or even decades listen to the greatest egon von greyerz audio interview ever by clicking here or on the image below sponsored japan looted more than 6 600 tonnes of gold from china egon von greyerz continues the history of china and gold is fascinating and even more so when japan s looting of chinese gold is added to the story japan was interested in the chinese gold since the sino japanese war in 1894 japan spent time and resources on the manchurian gold exploration from that time to the end of wwii japan is said to have looted a considerable amount of gold from mines in northeastern china not only that but in 1937 as the civil war in china was raging and mao and the communists pushed chiang kai shek out the japanese invaders stole 6 600 tonnes of gold from the chinese capital nanking this is a lot of gold the value today would be 280 billion the west will never get its gold back the us is allegedly the biggest gold holder in the world with 8 000 tonnes but as i wrote in a recent kwn article most of that gold is probably in china and the rest spread throughout asia as the us has disposed of or leased most of its gold the us will never get back the gold and whatever they have leased is also gone forever the fed and most central banks lease gold into the market in order to earn a return as well as to unnaturally suppress the gold price this gold used to stay in london or new york with the lbma bullion banks but today silk road countries including russia buy all the gold they can vacuum out of the west thus the lbma banks give the central banks an iou and then sell the physical gold to the east for the central banks that gold is gone forever the lbma will never find sufficient gold to hand the gold back to them so that paper gold iou is totally worthless this means that the lbma banks will fail as they can t make good on their physical gold commitments meanwhile the central banks vaults will remain empty leading to a collapse of the country s currency and a surge in the gold price the us used the looted gold for black operations around the world circling back to the looted gold the 6 600 tonnes that japan stole from china became part of the yamashita gold this was gold and treasures that japan looted all over asia from china korea indonesia and malaysia the gold was hidden mainly in the philippines and japan yamashita was the japanese general in charge of constructing massive and very intricate tunnels to hide the stolen gold and the other treasures the looting and hiding of the gold involved massive atrocities committed by the japanese army major parts of this gold have been found by the us and reportedly used for black operations all around the world the chinese people have learned the hard way the importance of gold china was the first country to introduce fiat money during the tang dynasty circa 740 bc the value of the chinese fiat money remained stable until the yuan dynasty in the 13th and 14th centuries this was the first period of chinese hyperinflation as they printed vast amounts of money to fund their wars china s tragic and terrifying hyperinflation later in the 1930s and 40s chinese money lost its value completely as the chiang kai shek rule was coming to an end he was was the president of mainland china from 1928 to 1949 chiang started in grand style loans made up 49 of the government revenue in 1929 the finances deteriorated further after the japanese invasion in 1932 in the final years of chiang s rule the chinese economy was collapsing and money printing was rampant one us dollar was worth 3 4 yuan in 1937 but by 1949 one us dollar was worth 23 million yuan china s inflation rate reached a maximum monthly rate of 2178 in may 1949 with an equivalent daily inflation rate of 11 according to the cato journal the highest denomination at the time was 6 billion yuan why china s nationalist government took over the nation s banks and switched from silver standard to fiat currency it then used the currency to monetize its debt sound familiar and continued printing money during the war with japan and the civil war fought against mao s communist forces see chart below cue the panic the chinese understanding of the importance of gold started during this hyperinflationary period as economic conditions deteriorated severely the photographer henri cartier bresson captured in the famous picture below a proper chinese gold run in december 1948 as the currency became worthless the nationalist government decided to issue 40 grams of gold per person as the photo shows there was total panic to get hold of the life saving gold and many people were literally crushed to death during the mayhem this would be an anathema to anyone in the west virtually no individual saves any of his money in gold instead the average american or european spends all of his income and then borrows a lot more for consumption studies cars and housing the chinese gold line the chinese gold line is the first line which i mentioned at the beginning of the article virtually nobody in the west understands the significance of this line the line signifies the desperation of people after a period of severe mismanagement of a country s finances the whole world today is in a similar situation after over 100 years of destruction of paper money through the buildup of massive credit and money printing we will soon get to the point when people around the world will be desperate to get hold of real money gold but at that point it will be too late today there are virtually no gold shops in the west interestingly there are virtually no gold shops to be found in the west london has two specialized shops where gold bars and coins can be purchased in zurich there is one in the centre and one outside the same goes for most cities a few decades ago virtually every swiss bank sold gold and had gold in the windows that is all gone and ubs used to have specialist gold counters in many places but they are also gone admittedly there are a number of online gold sellers no gold available during the coming panic within the next few years we will see similar panic lines in front of the few gold shops that still exist today the panic will be worse because these shops will have no stock to sell not even the 40 grams 1 800 today that the chinese got in 1938 when the masses wake up to the fact that gold is the only way to survive the coming crisis there will be no gold available at any price the paper gold dealers like comex or the lbma banks will have defaulted on their commitments since they have no gold to deliver against massive amount of paper claims which are many 100s of times larger than the available gold stock so for anyone who wants to own some gold now is the time to buy it not when the papers start writing about gold or the television broadcasts the panic in the gold market then it is too late and you will not get any gold at any price again today is the time to get your gold because tomorrow will be too late and if i am slightly off on my timing all you have done is to buy life saving insurance a few days too early the gold maginot line the second line is what i call the gold maginot line maginot was the french minister of war before wwii started he built a very intricate line of fortifications to protect france from attack by germany the line was impervious to most forms of attacks and had underground garrisons railways etc still the germans attacked north of the line through holland and belgium and eventually managed to break through in the ardennes forest the modern use of the maginot line expression is a strategy which inspires a false sense of security the maginot line or gold maginot line i refer to is the line of resistance in the gold price since august of 2013 as the chart below shows the gold price has been held below the 1 350 level for the last 5 1 2 years western gold maginot line will be overrun in 2019 western gold maginot line will fall shortly the gold maginot line was attacked in 2016 and 2018 but was successfully defended both times by an increasingly desperate west regardless whether the line just represents 5 years of consolidation or whether it has been actively defended by the bis and bullion banks doesn t really matter no one must believe that the line will hold it is extremely likely to be decisively penetrated in 2019 and most likely within the next 90 days and once it is broken the lengthy gold correction will finally be viewed as being over and the price of gold will be well on its way to new all time highs and beyond once the gold maginot line is broken that creates the conditions for the chinese line which means a panic in the west to get hold of gold that will be met with permanent shortages so the current belief in the west that gold has lost its luster which has led to complacency since the peak in 2011 is extremely dangerous caution do not wait any longer but as i said previously don t wait for either of these lines to be penetrated triggering panic because when that happens it will soon become extremely difficult to get hold of physical gold at any price and remember you are not buying gold for investment instead you are buying gold for wealth preservation or insurance purposes which means for financial and physical survival without that you could end up like the venezuelans or any other historic victims of hyperinflation for those who would like to read more of egon von greyerz s fantastic articles click here kwn has now released the fascinating kwn audio interview with rick rule click here or on the

from plans to tighten monetary policy thank you for reading this post don t forget to subscribe hours after the us president finished his state of the union address in the house chamber philip lowe the governor of the reserve bank of australia stood up to warn of an accumulation of downside risks including trade skirmishes between china and the us rising populism and brexit the next move in interest rates could be down he said instead of up the reserve bank of india which has been under pressure from prime minister narendra modi to ease policy trimmed rates by a quarter point a day later the same day the bank of england ditched plans for multiple rate hikes their dovish pivots followed what was by far the most significant policy u turn to date a decision by federal reserve chairman jay powell on january 30 to shelve any plans to lift rates further because of possible risks to us growth the reserve bank of india governor shaktikanta das reuters the wariness descending over leading central banks is a jarring contrast to the buoyant mood this time last year at the gathering of business and political leaders in davos switzerland in january 2018 optimism was simmering with one survey of bosses putting confidence at its highest for six years the imf hailed the broadest synchronised global upsurge since the start of the decade with 120 economies enjoying a pick up in growth that picture has now darkened an update from the imf last month bemoaned the backdrop of weakening financial market sentiment trade policy uncertainty and concerns about china s outlook growth in advanced economies will slow from an estimated 2 3 per cent in 2018 to 2 per cent in 2019 and 1 7 per cent in 2020 it said global manufacturing activity is at a two and a half year low you are getting a much more sober assessment of global growth says mohamed el erian chief economic adviser at allianz what has gone wrong the sea change reflects in part a realisation that policymakers became overly bullish last year says mr el erian the fed in particular over reached by signalling four increases in interest rates for 2018 when the global economy was still fragile he says its new found caution is providing air cover for other central banks to mark down their own rate expectations the key turning point came in the fourth quarter when markets suddenly began to wake up to a host of political hazards including the danger of a further worsening in trade relations between the us and china that tightening in financial conditions was enough to shave 0 4 per cent from growth in us output after six months says isabelle mateos y lago a strategist at the blackrock investment institute since then between a third and a quarter of that tightening has been reversed as equities rebounded but central banks still had no choice but to respond she says it makes sense to lift the foot off the brake the us domestic economy has continued to put in a robust performance with the number of new jobs in january coming in well ahead of wall street expectations and wage growth running comfortably above inflation but corporate giants in the s p 500 index which generate over a third of their earnings overseas are sounding the alarm about faltering overseas demand in markets including china where the government has been battling against a slowdown smaller us firms are feeling the global chill as well rob parmentier president of marquis yachts which employs 350 people in green bay wisconsin says that while domestic demand is firm the tit for tat imposition of tariffs has clobbered his international business it is not getting bad it is dead he says bluntly the addition of a 25 per cent tariff on us boat exports to europe has been punishing he adds it is twofold not only the tariffs but europe has never really come back from their recession the fed which led the world s major central banks in beginning to tighten in 2015 has been at the centre of the recent outbreak of dovishness mr powell presided over a quarter point increase in rates on december 19 but his attempts to couple that rise with reassuring messaging about future moves fell flat the danger sign came when equities were sold off after the chairman repeated well worn language insisting the reduction of the central bank s balance sheet will run on automatic pilot wall street s dyspeptic reaction to his words underscored to policymakers just how fragile market sentiment had become business confidence has since been dented by the record long federal government shutdown while brexit discussions have floundered moreover hopes of progress in trade talks with china have sunk as mr trump has ruled out a direct meeting with chinese president xi jinping before his march 1 deadline for a deal on january 30 federal reserve chairman jay powell right shelved plans to lift rates further because of possible risks to us growth with us inflation as tepid as ever the fed has set aside recent worries about economic overheating focusing instead on what central bankers like to call downside risks rate rises are for the time being off the agenda indeed if the current ceasefire over trade is reversed analysts will start asking about rate reductions in the us were trade talks between the us and china to break down altogether accompanied by full blown hostilities with europe over auto trade america could be pushed into an outright recession according to deutsche bank its analysts further flag the risks of a sharper chinese slowdown and a no deal brexit the mood of unease at the fed is being mirrored elsewhere the australian central bank this week shifted to a more cautious outlook amid concerns that steep falls in house prices and the slowdown in china could choke off domestic growth unemployment in australia fell to 5 per cent in december its lowest rate since 2011 but there are growing concerns that a weakening housing market is hitting household consumption with retail sales unexpectedly falling by 0 4 per cent in december compared with the previous month evidence of the deteriorating housing market is on show every weekend in sydney and melbourne where once bustling saturday housing auctions now struggle to attract even a handful of buyers just four in every 10 homes put up for sale in december were sold in the traditional roadside auctions prices in australia s two biggest cities have fallen 12 per cent and 9 per cent respectively from peaks achieved in 2017 shane oliver amp economist predicts that prices could fall by as much as 25 per cent from their peak levels stephen king an economic adviser to hsbc sees good reason for central bankers to be treading carefully of 37 countries he recently examined only eight have reduced their aggregate debt ratios compared with the beginning of the financial crisis this means central banks will naturally be more cautious in raising rates he argues if you thought the crisis was associated with debt in some senses we are in a more vulnerable state now some of the biggest questions hang over europe the european commission on thursday slashed its growth forecast for this year to 1 3 per cent from 1 9 per cent marking down outlooks for major economies including germany it is now predicting the weakest expansion in italy for five years people s bank of china the turning point came in the fourth quarter of 2018 when markets began to wake up to a host of political hazards including the danger of a worsening in trade relations between the us and china reuters the european central bank has sounded the alarm about the impact of trade tensions and brexit only weeks after it stopped expanding its 2 6tn quantitative easing programme but ms mateos y lago at blackrock says she fears the political barriers to restarting that particular stimulus plan are too high for the ecb to hurdle warning we are worried the eurozone is not very well equipped to meet a significant slowdown in the economy one of the ironies behind the changing mood among central bankers is that the most prominent u turn has occurred in what is arguably the most resilient looking major economy the us bill dunkelberg the chief economist at the national federation of independent business dismisses sombre talk saying the biggest immediate concern for firms is a shortage of labour it looks like everyone is getting into a tizzy over whether europe is going to slow down or india or china he says that will have some impact for the us but i think we are getting carried away here mr trump who described the us as the hottest economy anywhere not even close in his state of the union speech would no doubt agree some analysts wonder whether having become overly hawkish last year the fed has now overcorrected the us is relatively less exposed to trade which in the past has allowed it to avoid importing nasty foreign crises to its own shores but as the federal shutdown showed earlier this year it is also a country that is prone to self inflicted economic wounds potentially destabilising battles loom in congress over the need to raise the ceiling on the us s national debt meanwhile the clock is ticking on mr trump s trade truce with china having been badly burnt by the market sell off late last year mr powell is determined to play things safer in 2019 by putting the tightening cycle on hold for a swelling band of central banks in other parts of the world there is ample reason to follow suit
in president trump s state of the union address we saw a brilliant display of rhetorical sleight of hand on the economy the successful misdirection was enabled by the corporate news media which consistently maintains that the one thing trump should be claiming credit for is his stellar performance growing the economy what was ignored was how it has also grown increasingly more unequal and tilted to the rich since he took office as the country sinks deeper and deeper into a miasma of long term multi trillion dollar debt in the critical commentary that followed the sotu the only quibbling on trump s assessment of the nation s economy was that he had failed to credit his predecessor president obama for getting things headed in the right direction for those assembled in the house chamber and those watching at home trump waved the shiny object of an economic miracle taking place in the united states an unprecedented economic boom a boom that has rarely been seen before so despite our life expectancy declining for the last three years one of the highest childhood poverty rates among the 36 member nations in the organization for economic co operation and development and the most expensive and least effective health care system among western developed nations trump would have us believe we are the envy of the world and with the tv cut away shots of the assembled men and women of congress and the decorated generals all nodding their heads and occasionally applauding there was legitimacy conferred on one man s delusion that the united states is the fastest growing economy in the world and that he is the key accelerant as richard wolff professor of economics at the new school pointed out trump s assertion of u s global economic preeminence ignores the reality that for many years now china has been growing exponentially faster than the united states the u s has struggled mightily to expand at all even as the richest got an increasingly larger share of the nation s wealth hmm could there be a connection between our increasingly extreme wealth concentration and sluggish broad based economic growth over the last twenty years the u s has had a hard time achieving economic growth and even though it is averaging two and a half to three percent part of the time to say that it s the best in the world that s just a lie wolff says let me give you just one example the people s republic of china they re having a bad year ready six and a half percent which is lower than they have been able to do for most of the last 15 to 20 years and what you might wonder were wages doing for workers all that time of major growth in china the real wages of chinese workers the average amount of money they got adjusted for inflation has quadrupled in the last 12 to 15 years says wolff what happened to the average wage in america adjusted for inflation it hardly budged it went up single digits not three to four times what made trump s magic sotu misdirection so complete was how right after he waved the glittery miracle of faux american prosperity in the air he conjured up the raping and pillaging hordes of blood sucking illegals that are coming over the southern border in waves that threaten to take it all away wolff points out that while trump cast undocumented immigrants as the only shadow on american greatness he didn t mention one word about the nation s growing wealth and income inequality which is the starkest feature of american economic life in the last 40 years of course it is in the interest of the builders of the great american wealth pyramid to continue to breathe life into this trumpian delusion that the american economy is working and working well ignoring the very real socio economic deterioration that has now manifested after decades of depressed and anemic wages and the degree to which there is a collective media buy in that things are great and improving the longer it will take for us to fully embrace the radical steps needed to get this country really working for all of america s families this never ending squeezing of americans who have to work every day to make a living has now mushroomed into a full blown affordability crisis that has tens of millions of working class american households struggling every month to cover the basics we had ample evidence of this during trump s 35 day government shutdown when furloughed federal workers had to wait on soup lines trump didn t mention them either

spokane wash ap washington farmers can expect a tougher year covering expenses even if political leaders finalize trade agreements with the countries that import apples beef and wheat from the evergreen state a washington state university professor said randy fortenbery an agriculture economics professor delivered the economic forecast wednesday at the spokane ag expo and pacific farm forum he spoke at length about the troubling overall picture of the forces grinding against what has been a robust u s economy i think commodity prices except for sorghum are going to be a little bit better than last year but we are talking dimes not dollars fortenbery said i don t think the price increase will offset the cost increases he openly contradicted president donald trump who last year said trade wars are good and easy to win the biggest issue is making some assumptions about the trade environment it really needs to get stabilized fortenbery said i don t care whether it s big tariffs or no tariffs people can adjust to tariffs if they know they are there permanently what becomes difficult is changing the rhetoric on a weekly or monthly basis about what we are or are not going to do that s not just a risk in agriculture that is a risk in what has been a really healthy u s economy in general when last year trump began threatening to place tariffs on u s imports of steel and aluminum fortenbery said china immediately targeted two things americans export the most agricultural commodities and airplanes we have i m going to argue probably one of the most aggressive trade realignment programs since maybe the 1920s he said what i mean by that is we are addressing every one of our trading partners simultaneously we haven t done that in decades the problem is that large companies have operations in several countries some steel companies produce raw material in one place and then ship it to the u s to produce finished products as a result some face 25 percent tariffs on the same steel twice which gets passed on to consumers winning trade wars is not easy they don t really work fortenbery said it s one thing to go to a country and say we have some problems with the way we are trading going after everybody at the same time and expecting a positive outcome in the short run that s a real challenge trump has announced agreements with leaders from canada and mexico to replace the north american free trade agreement but until congress ratifies the new deal mexico has withheld buying the same amount of american wheat and other commodities this is a huge deal because we were told nafta was the worst trade deal ever we were told the new one is an excellent trade deal but until it actually gets ratified by congress it doesn t go forward fortenbery said in the current political environment you can imagine we might have some political challenges trump has also suggested he would pull out of nafta completely if congress refuses to ratify the new deal fortenbery said that would be a bad thing for agriculture mexico and canada are really important trading partners for us on the ag side he said even if old trading partners settle the current trade war u s producers have no guarantee that other countries will import as many american goods as before the problem with trade disruptions is they last longer than one year fortenbery said even if we come back as price competitive with a new deal it doesn t mean that mexico comes back and buys from us in the same volume because they have already established a new relationship with someone else the top crop in washington in terms of value is apples the evergreen state produces about 67 percent of nation s apple crop he said our two biggest buyers are mexico and canada he said if the new deal isn t ratified then the fruit sector of washington is significantly at risk how this resolves itself will have a lot to say about what really does happen in 2019 and 2020 one bright spot has been high beef prices demand has really grown we have exported a lot more beef than projected fortenbery said but a large part of that demand is from international customers we have these huge inventories if the demand starts to decline because we are having trouble moving product into other countries along with the trade wars the value of the u s dollar has increased that means a company in france or china will have less purchasing power to import washington grown apples or cherries if we continue to have significant uncertainty in terms of what our trade opportunities are going to be this coming year fortenbery said then we might see a significant decline in farm income
in evaluating the latest call for a green new deal americans would do well to heed the lessons of 2008 when the idea was first introduced unless the transition to a clean energy economy is based on unifying politics this next iteration will also prove another adventure in pyrrhic rhetoric as founding executive director of the bluegreen alliance which brought together many of america s labor unions and environmental organizations and an architect of the first call for a green new deal in 2008 i believe that experience is important for congress to review to avoid further polarizing mistakes mosads the original global call for a green new deal was delivered by achim steiner head of the united nations environment program in response to the great recession steiner s call for massive investments in clean energy was equally a solution to skyrocketing unemployment as to the growing threat of climate change without the unemployment crisis there would have been no basis for calling for a green new deal second the great recession was preceded by a dramatic three year rise in oil prices that climbed to over 145 a barrel by may 2008 this rise contributed to a global crisis in agriculture highly dependent on oil for fuel and fertilizer the accompanying food riots were well documented from egypt to indonesia oil a foundational commodity for global society was believed to be in permanent decline these factors were key elements in why a green new deal made sense finally it is important to note that the linkage of economic crises with environmental challenges had a specific history in the u s dating back to the wto protests of 1999 at that time a predecessor organization to the bluegreen alliance the alliance for sustainable jobs and the environment introduced the first common agenda for workers and conservationists on the streets of seattle founded by legendary environmental activist david brower and myself asje called for enforceable labor and environmental standards in all trade agreements as a foundational principle for strengthening unions raising living standards and improving environmental regulations worldwide in early 2009 steiner came to washington d c to call for all governments to invest 25 percent of their stimulus dollars in the green economy to solve the great recession and address climate change in march of that year i joined him in nairobi for the biennial unep conference to repeat that call unfortunately few countries responded at the level that both challenges demanded the united states made perhaps the largest investment of any country nearly 100 billion in clean energy creating one million jobs more common was the refrain i heard at subsequent conferences in europe better a brown recovery than a green recession job strategies based on green investments were seen as destructive to existing employment while insufficient to produce alternative employment what has changed today first we are no longer in the middle of a recession while unemployment is low inequality in america is the worst in 50 years defined by both race and zip code oil prices are also low and supplies are abundant that s bad for the climate but good for workers whose lives are dependent on individual transportation global supply chains are even more integrated today transforming most forms of labor into a global commodity with precarious results for working class people a recent survey prepared by the international trade union confederation in 16 countries covering 53 percent of the world s population found that 40 percent of families had experienced unemployment in the last two years this experience has led to a collapse in confidence in government not just in america but everywhere under these circumstances does the call for 100 percent renewable energy in the united states make sense as a unifying platform for empowering working people giving them a stronger voice in american democracy and providing them with stable employment in a global economy unfortunately to america s 75 000 nuclear power plant workers who produce 20 percent of the country s electricity all of it carbon free this sounds more like a declaration of war and to the country s 600 000 employees in the natural gas industry whose growth in the last decade displacing coal as the primary fuel for electricity is the single largest reason that us carbon emissions have dropped during most of the past decade it sounds like an assault on their living standards instead of a green new deal based on short term crisis intervention to disrupt the economy congress would do better focusing on three long term issues which together could guide america s economy toward a low carbon future those three policies are putting a price on carbon enacting a long term technology neutral clean energy standard linking the carbon price and clean energy standard to border adjustments that protect american workers and their employers from carbon polluters the economy as a whole needs to price carbon to provide a clear signal that over the next 30 years we will move to clean energy in the most cost effective way possible it must include all fuels and generation types how we price carbon is less important than how we use the revenues these must fund the transition for impacted communities ensure broader equity and support new technology particularly in the industrial sector a clean energy standard would put all technologies on an equal footing provide a basis for stabilizing our largest current source of zero emissions electricity nuclear and reward the partial contributions of cleaner sources of generation this transition will take 30 years those who work in these industries need to know that the investment of their careers to produce america s energy will be dealt with in a thoughtful manner mossecondads however neither of these policies will achieve acceptance from working people if they are not linked to a clear declaration that america will protect their labor standards wages and employers when they embrace the cleanest energy requirements in the world without utilizing our trade agreements as a powerful tool for protecting our commitments to labor the environment and our businesses just as the yellow vest movement turned on president macron s gas tax america s working people will see another green new deal as simply another choice between a brown kleptocracy and a green aristocracy america s congress its business labor environmental and equal rights communities can do so much better david foster served as senior advisor to u s secretary of energy ernest moniz from 2014 2017 on energy climate and economic development issues prior to working at the department of energy he served as the founding executive director of the bluegreen alliance bga a strategic partnership of 14 of america s most important unions and environmental organizations with a combined membership of 14 5 million from 1990 to 2006 he was the director of united steelworkers district no 11 a 13 state region based in minneapolis
el callao venezuela s most successful financial operations in recent years have not taken place on wall street but in primitive gold mining camps in the nation s southern reaches with the country s economy in meltdown an estimated 300 000 fortune hunters have descended on this mineral rich jungle area to earn a living pulling gold flecked earth from makeshift mines their picks and shovels are helping to prop up the leftist government of president nicolas maduro since 2016 his administration has purchased 17 tonnes of the metal worth around 650 million from so called artisan miners according to the most recent data from the nation s central bank paid with the country s near worthless bank notes these amateurs in turn supply the government with hard currency to purchase badly needed imports of food and hygiene products this gold trade is a blip on international markets still the united states is using sanctions and intimidation in an effort to stop maduro from using his nation s gold to stay afloat the trump administration is pressuring the united kingdom not to release 1 2 billion in gold reserves venezuela has stored in the bank of england u s officials recently castigated an abu dhabi based investment firm for its venezuela gold purchases and have warned other potential foreign buyers to back off the existence of maduro s gold programme is well known how it functions is not to get a glimpse inside reuters tracked venezuela s gold from steamy jungle mines through the central bank in the capital of caracas to gold refineries and food exporters abroad speaking with more than 30 people with knowledge of the trade they included miners intermediaries merchants academic researchers diplomats and government officials almost all requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly or because they feared retribution from venezuelan or u s authorities what emerges is the portrait of a desperate experiment in laissez faire industrial policy by venezuela s socialist leaders u s sanctions have hammered the nation s oil industry and crippled its ability to borrow the formal mining sector has been decimated by nationalization so maduro has unleashed freelance prospectors to extract the nation s mineral wealth with virtually no regulation or state investment the bolivarian revolution now leans heavily on ragtag labourers such as jose aular a teenager who says he has contracted malaria five times at a wildcat mine near venezuela s border with brazil aular works 12 hours daily lugging sacks of earth to a small mill that uses toxic mercury to extract flecks of precious metal mining accidents are common in these ramshackle operations workers said so are shootings and robberies the government knows what happens in these mines and it benefits from it said aular 18 our gold goes into their hands maduro has also received a crucial assist from turkish president recep erdogan a fellow strongman who has likewise sparred with the trump administration venezuela sells most of its gold to turkish refineries then uses some of the proceeds to buy that nation s consumer goods according to people with direct knowledge of the trade turkish pasta and powdered milk are now staples in maduro s subsidized food program trade between the two nations grew eightfold last year but scrutiny is intensifying as venezuela s politics reach the boiling point in recent days many western countries have recognized venezuela s opposition leader juan guaido as the south american nation s rightful president maduro s adversaries have called on foreign buyers of venezuela s precious metal to stop doing business with what they say is an illegitimate regime we are going to protect our gold opposition legislator carlos paparoni told reuters in an interview gold fever the gold road begins in places like la culebra an isolated jungle area in southern venezuela here hundreds of men labour in crude mining operations that would be at home in the 19th century they excavate mineral laden dirt with picks in hand dug tunnels hauling it out with pulleys and winches their activity is laying waste to fragile forest ecosystems and spreading mosquito borne diseases miners complain of shakedowns by military forces sent to guard the region whose homicide rate is seven times the national average venezuela s ministries of defence and information did not respond to requests for comment miner jose rondon is used to hardship now 47 he arrived in 2016 from northeast venezuela with his two adult sons his bus driver s salary could not keep pace with venezuela s hyperinflation which the international monetary fund projects will hit 10 million percent this year the three men net roughly 10 grams of gold monthly from backbreaking work still it is roughly 20 times what they could earn back home here i do much better said rondon resting in a crude bunkhouse strung with hammocks gold in hand miners head to the town of el callao to sell their nuggets most buyers are unlicensed small scale traders working in cramped shops fitted with alarms and steel doors the state is buying gold everyone is buying gold because it s what is doing well said jhony diaz a licensed wholesaler in puerto ordaz 171 kilometres 106 miles north of el callao diaz says he buys gold from traders and resells every three days to the central bank because venezuela s currency the bolivar is worth less every hour someone holds it the state pays a premium over international prices to make it worthwhile for those who could smuggle gold out of the country to exchange for dollars traders who sell to diaz end up with bricks of cash to carry back to el callao and other gold rush towns to pay miners who use it to buy food supplies and send whatever is left to their families gold purchased by the government is smelted in the nearby furnaces of minerven the state run mining company according to a high ranking employee it is then transported to the vaults of the central bank in the capital caracas 843 kilometers 524 miles away the gold does not stay there long the central bank s gold reserves have plummeted to their lowest levels in 75 years venezuela is selling the artisan metal as well as existing reserves to pay its bills according to two high ranking government officials the main buyer these days is turkey the officials said turkish alliance maduro s gold program has developed in tandem with his deepening relationship with turkey s erdogan both leaders have been criticised internationally for cracking down on political dissent and undermining democratic norms to concentrate power a november 1 executive order signed by u s president donald trump bars u s persons and entities from buying gold from venezuela it does not apply to foreigners ankara has assured the u s treasury that all of turkey s trade with venezuela is in accordance with international law venezuela in december 2016 announced a direct flight from caracas to istanbul on turkish airlines the development was surprising given low demand for travel between the two nations trade data show those planes are carrying more than passengers on new year s day 2018 venezuela s central bank began shipping gold to turkey with a 36 million air shipment of the metal to istanbul it came just weeks after a visit by maduro to turkey shipments last year reached 900 million according to turkish government data and trade reports venezuela s central bank has been selling its artisan gold directly to turkish refiners according to two senior venezuelan officials proceeds go to the venezuelan state development bank bandes to purchase turkish consumer goods the officials said gold buyers include istanbul gold refinery or igr and sardes kiymetli mandele a turkish trading firm according to a person who works in turkey s gold industry as well as a caracas based diplomat and the two senior venezuelan officials in an interview with reuters igr ceo aysan esen denied the company has been involved in any venezuelan gold deals in a written statement she said she met with venezuelan and turkish officials in istanbul in april to offer her views on compliance with international regulations esen said she advised the turkish government that working with venezuela would not be right for leading institutions or the state as for sardes kiymetli mandele no one at its istanbul offices responded to inquiries from reuters turkish consumer products meanwhile are making their way to venezuelan tables in early december 54 containers of turkish powdered milk arrived at the port of la guaira near caracas according to port records seen by reuters the istanbul based shipper mulberry proje yatirim shares an address with marilyns proje yatirin a mining company that signed a joint venture with venezuela s state mining firm minerven last year according to filings with a turkish trade registry gazette in september the companies did not respond to a request for comment even maduro s critics acknowledge he has pulled off a neat trick of alchemy by compensating hard pressed citizen miners with inflation ravaged bolivars and obtaining

speaking at a conference in dubai uae lagarde said the future of the international oil market does not appear to be unequivocally bright due to a combination of upside and downside factors lagarde warned oil reliant economies against ramping up budget spending saying their oil revenue might plunge again modest growth continues but the outlook is highly uncertain lagarde said the imf chief also said that over the past few years fiscal revenue in oil exporting countries has improved sparking an urge to increase budget spending among several national governments lagarde suggested such plans should be put on hold due to the lack of clarity of whither oil prices go in the near to medium term fiscal deficits are only slowly declining despite significant reforms on both the spending and revenue sides including the introduction of vat and excise taxes lagarde said this has led to a sharp increase in public debt from 13 per cent of gdp in 2013 to 33 per cent in 2018 lagarde s remarks come in the wake of ambitious announcements from the governments of saudi arabia and the uae which both recently unveiled massive infrastructure and modernisation projects to ease their reliance on oil however imf experts believe it s not the right time just yet suggesting fiscal consolidation could be a better option read more imf projects new wave of hyperinflation in venezuela in the uae growth in the non oil sector is expected to accelerate to 3 9 per cent this year and to 4 2 per cent in 2020 according to the imf meanwhile experts also pointed out that a recent rebound in oil prices has supported emirati economic growth however another possible crash in oil prices could deal some damage to the uae where many companies are now exposed to a higher level of debt than they were prior to the 2014 bust given dubai s large public sector debt staff encouraged the authorities to be prudent when implementing recent revenue reducing measures while containing current expenditure growth and executing the planned investment efficiently the imf said in its report moreover the imf chief said that the middle east s public sector debt to gdp ratio increased from 64 per cent in 2008 to 85 per cent last year lagarde also pointed out that in many oil exporting countries public debt exceeds 90 per cent of gdp with very little progress on the path of easing their reliance on crude
for the past decade politics in the global north has been in a state of high madness owing to excessive fear of government debts and deficits but two recent straws in the wind suggest that this may at long last be changing earlier this month i read a brexit related column in the sunday times of london by the eminent and highly knowledgeable ken rogoff he is perhaps best known for his declarations early in this decade that governments should not let their debt to gdp ratios rise above 90 per cent but here rogoff mused that it had never been remotely obvious to why the uk should be worrying about reducing its debt gdp burden currently 84 per cent given modest growth high inequality and the decline in interest rates this followed a financial times article late last month by the journalist brendan greeley who reported receiving what he called a panicked email from the committee for a responsible federal budget crfb a us think tank that once gave a fiscal responsibility award to paul ryan the then chair of the us house of representatives budget committee in its email the crfb warned against mischaracterizations of an address by my old teacher olivier blanchard to the american economic association in which blanchard essentially said that public debt is a tool governments should use when they need to what rogoff and blanchard are saying today is standard policy economics in fact i always found it hard to believe and still do that anybody can take exception to it whenever the private sector stops spending enough to keep unemployment low and jobs easy to find the public sector needs to fill the gap in aggregate demand the normal way to do this is for the central bank to buy bonds for cash inducing those who then have the extra cash to boost their spending but if and when interest rates approach rock bottom the private sector s desire to spend extra cash rather than hold it ebbs in that situation monetary stimulus should be aided by fiscal stimulus in other words the government directly buys stuff this may lead to fears that public debt would rise too high so that issuing more debt to finance additional government purchases would represent a bad deal even if it boosted employment but the deal would be bad only if the government had to borrow at a high interest rate as was the case at the start of the 1990s and the deal would be risky only to the extent that the government might have to roll over its debt at a high interest rate thus the bond market would signal when the deficit needed to be cut and the debt to gdp ratio placed on a downward trajectory the principle that the cost of debt is measured by the interest rate charged would seem simple and obvious and yet for the past decade until now public debate in the global north has regarded this as a fringe ultra keynesian belief i date the full flowering of this affliction to january 27 2010 that evening in his state of the union address then us president barack obama announced that it was time for the government to tighten its belt that he was going to freeze government spending and that he would veto bills passed by the then majority democratic congress that overstepped his red line at the time my first reaction was that issuing a veto threat against his two chief lieutenants house speaker nancy pelosi and senate majority leader harry reid was a unique way of building intra party comity and a previously unheard of way of maintaining a functioning governing coalition obama s former economic policy staffers say that he was the global north s most rational and best behaved ruling politician in the first half of this decade and they are right but it is a powerful indicator of those debt fearing times that obama s address delivered when the us unemployment rate was still 9 7 per cent went against john maynard keynes s 1937 observation that the boom not the slump is the right time for austerity at the treasury it is still not clear to me why the global north fell into this fit of denial of basic economic principles clearly the interest rate is a measure of the cost of debt and deficits equally clearly austerity is inappropriate when unemployment is high but with the likes of rogoff and blanchard weighing in i now have hope that future economists will remember the sorry history of this past decade and prevent it from being repeated project syndicate
when i participated in the chatham house daiwa research institute conference on the post brexit japan united kingdom relationship in tokyo last month it was my first visit back to japan since my departure from goldman sachs almost six years ago prior to this trip i had been visiting the country regularly since 1988 so it was helpful to see things from a slightly more detached perspective by and large japan in 2019 feels relatively stable when compared to other advanced economies a decade from now i would not be surprised if it continues to show the highest real inflation adjusted per capita gross domestic product growth rate in the group of seven true japan s annual gdp growth has averaged just 1 1 percent so far this decade but its declining population and shrinking workforce is already translating into stronger per capita performance in fact given the country s demographic challenges it might well be outperforming its long term growth potential
business news of sunday 10 february 2019 source thefinderonline com the bank of ghana bog has been urged to conduct aggressive open market operations to mop up ghana cedi liquidity more frequently in order to reduce the demand pressures on the foreign exchange market according to economist courage martey a boost to foreign exchange supply is required to complement any demand side management policy in order to slow down the pace of depreciation the ghana cedi lost 1 0 percent year on year depreciation to the us dollar on friday february 3 2019 according to ecobank research it is presently going for about ghc5 05 to the american currency ecobank research has attributed the recent appreciation in the us dollar as a major reason the ghana cedi floating regime amid high current account deficit and low fx reserves make the currency vulnerable to external shocks as a strong usd therefore we think pressures are likely to remain in the medium term on the back of emerging markets and frontier markets risk aversion it therefore expects the central bank to maintain policy rate at current level to ease pressures on the local currency mr martey who is also a senior economic advisor at databank said the rate of depreciation will slowdown but it is difficult to see a slowdown in the first quarter i do not see significant boost in fx supply until after quarter one 2019 when government is likely to issue up to us 2 billion eurobond per the 2019 budget later in the year i think this anticipated eurobond inflow will provide significant support to fx supply and slow down the pace of depreciation he added the ghana cedi ended the year 2018 with an annualized depreciation of about 8 8 percent to the us dollar this is against 4 45 percent depreciation in 2017 in 2016 the cedi lost about 9 2 percent in value to the american green back according to ecobank research south african rand and swaziland lilangeni are the best performing african currencies for the first month of 2019 they have both appreciated 8 0 percent against the us dollar the naira has also appreciated by 0 5 against the american currency so far this year whilst the cfa remains unchanged
us china trade tensions could hit african growth afdb the ongoing trade battle between the us and china could have a negative impact of 0 7 percent of gdp from africa through lack of trade and investment flows according to a senior official at the african development bank persisting trade tensions between economic superpowers the united states and china could shave 0 7 percent from africa s gdp in 2019 a senior official at the african development bank afdb said on friday hanan morsy director of the afdb s macroeconomic policy department made the prediction on the sidelines of an african union meeting in addis ababa as fresh doubts emerged over the prospects for us china trade war negotiations she was speaking after the release of the bank s african economic outlook 2019 report which said the continent registered growth of 3 5 percent in 2018 and was expected to grow 4 percent in 2019 this is higher than most regions of the world but still insufficient to address persistent fiscal and current account deficits and unsustainable debt furthermore the ongoing trade battle between the us and china could have a negative impact of 0 7 percent of gdp from africa this impact will be through lack of trade and investment flows afdb in particular expects a noticeable impact in the tradeable sectors including export commodities like minerals oil and food related products she added us president donald trump l pictured november 2018 said he did not expect to meet his chinese counterpart xi jinping before march 1 leading to a slump in world stock markets the united states has threatened to more than double existing tariffs on chinese goods at the start of march if there is no agreement on measures to reform china s trade practices which washington says are deeply unfair us president donald trump said thursday he did not expect to meet his chinese counterpart xi jinping before the march 1 deadline leading to a slump in world stock markets top white house economist larry kudlow told fox business on thursday that while trump was optimistic about prospects for a deal there remained a sizeable distance separating the two sides a lack of a breakthrough could weaken the global economy with already gloomy growth forecasts from the european commission on thursday which predicted lower than expected growth of 1 3 percent in the eurozone this year a slowdown in the global economy could lead to a decline in demand for africa s exports more than 60 percent of which head to the us china and europe said the afdb report the report said that in 2019 40 percent of african countries are projected to see growth of at least 5 percent advertisement however a burgeoning working age population means the continent needs to create 12 million jobs a year meaning the nature of economic growth has to change to move away from mainly informal sector jobs
if president trump is serious about bringing back manufacturing jobs through renegotiated free trade deals he may find some surprising allies progressive democrats and labor unions have long criticized treaties like the north american free trade agreement which according to government accounting has resulted in the loss of 1 million u s jobs and driven down wages trump has taken a stab at renegotiating nafta which he has re branded as the united states mexico and canada agreement taking out some of the bad features of the original treaty while leaving some of the worst ones intact before the new agreement can take effect it will need to be ratified by congress and in order to do that trump will need votes from democrats this is an opportunity to improve the lives of workers in maine if a new nafta can do that democrats should not shy away from working with the president even though they have so many other areas of disagreement it was good to hear maine s new congressman 2nd district rep jared golden say that he would be open to support the right kind of revision i agree with the president that nafta has failed working mainers but his nafta 2 0 proposal needs significant changes to ensure we don t repeat the same disastrous trade policies that have led to closed mills outsourced jobs and stagnant wages golden said in a statement released after the state of the union address tuesday if the president can follow through on his bipartisan talk with bipartisan leadership i ll work with him to improve these proposals so they deliver results for maine people unequal benefits advertisement negotiated in the 1990s and promoted by president bill clinton nafta was the first in a series of trade deals that enabled the emergence of a global economy it was supposed to fuel broad economic prosperity but it hasn t worked for everyone corporations have been able to avoid union contracts as well as labor and environmental laws while still taking advantage of the world s biggest consumer market by setting up shop across the border the big winners have been corporate investors who have reaped the profits that come from lower production costs nafta was supposed to create new markets for american made goods by raising the standard of living in mexico but the benefits have not been well distributed a little over half of cross border trading has been between divisions of the same corporations adding to the company s bottom line but not necessarily creating wealth for anyone else u s consumers have taken advantage of low prices for cars and appliances but have also seen communities hollowed out when plants shut down and good paying jobs disappear workers paid the biggest price either by losing their jobs or having their wages suppressed by the credible threat that their employer could move the work south of the border trump s improvements trump s new agreement improves on the original nafta in some important ways for the first time it sets a minimum wage for autoworkers requiring 30 percent of the content of vehicles sold here to be made by workers who earn at least 16 per hour growing to 40 percent over time that s three times what mexican manufacturing workers get now poverty wages for what used to be middle class jobs the agreement also requires that workers have rights to form unions something not guaranteed under mexican law but the enforcement mechanisms are weak leaving all the incentives in place for the manufacturers to continue their race to the bottom of the pay scale the same is true for the environmental protections for manufacturers and the agreement has no mention of climate change a crisis that does not recognize borders advertisement and the agreement would create new monopoly protections for pharmaceutical drugs driving up prices across the continent without benefiting the public international trade is intensely complex and many maine jobs depend on relatively frictionless trade with canada those workers would not benefit from the trade war that could be started by throwing out the agreement entirely golden and the democrats should find a way to work with the administration to address the defects in the president s new nafta agreement regardless of the hostile political climate negotiating a win for american workers would be worth it even if that meant giving one to president trump send questions comments to the editors filed under

washington ap a new report from the white house tries to shift the trump administration s combative rhetoric on health care suggesting changes to the affordable care act under president donald trump do not fundamentally undermine the health law the council of economic advisers report released friday says obama era subsidies that help low and middle income customers pay their premiums will help keep healthcare gov afloat even if some healthy people drop out or seek other coverage because of trump s changes nearly 90 percent of customers get taxpayer provided assistance the report reflects the outcome of 2018 midterm elections in which democrats successfully campaigned on keeping the aca and effectively ended trump s drive to repeal it democratic 2020 white house hopefuls are seizing on health care as an issue with some pushing for a government run system that would cover all americans and replace the aca better known as obamacare the council is a white house agency that advises the president larry levitt of the nonpartisan kaiser family foundation said it suggests to him the administration is trying to move on from the battle over the aca which trump and republicans in congress failed to repeal the president seemed to take pride in undermining the aca but now his administration is resisting the argument that they have undermined the health law levitt said they can point to benefits of deregulation but will also have to live with the costs which include higher premiums for middle class people with pre existing conditions file in this jan 23 2019 file photo a view of the white house in washington wednesday jan 23 2019 borrowing a word from democrats a new white house report says changes made to the affordable care act under president donald trump didn t amount to sabotage ap photo susan walsh file the aca has risen in popularity with the public the report looks at three big changes under trump that affect former president barack obama s health care law they are congressional repeal of the law s unpopular fines on people who go uninsured association health plans for small businesses and low cost short term health insurance that doesn t have to cover basic benefits like prescription drugs these reforms do not sabotage the aca but rather provide a more efficient focus of tax funded care to those in need says the report casting the administration s changes as de regulation it comes as house democrats under speaker nancy pelosi d calif are moving to shore up the aca including trying to undo some of trump s insurance changes although such a rollback seems unlikely to succeed under divided government there has been bipartisan support for measures that would help reduce premiums and guarantee coverage for pre existing conditions restoring the ad budget for healthcare gov slashed by trump is also a possibility about 10 million people continue to get private insurance through the aca s subsidized markets or exchanges and another 12 million are covered by its medicaid expansion casey mulligan chief economist for the white house council said it turns out that the health law s penalty for people going uninsured wasn t really essential for the program to function he said the subsidies were more important removing the tax penalty and opening up more affordable options was able to save taxpayer dollars give families more choice without destabilizing the exchanges he said the report didn t address constitutional arguments in a texas court case against the aca brought by red state officials but its economic analysis could have a bearing on that case the plaintiffs contend that the whole law was made unconstitutional by congressional repeal of the fines on the uninsured a federal district court judge agreed and that ruling is on appeal the justice department has said in connection with the case that it will no longer defend the law s protections for people with pre existing conditions now the white house report undercuts the notion that the tax penalties at issue in the case are central to the health law officials at the council of economic advisers said they re not policymakers or lawyers but economists the report also claims 450 billion in consumer benefits over the next 10 years based on broader availability of less costly insurance options reduced taxpayer spending on subsidies and the cancelled fines but it acknowledges that premiums will go up for some middle and upper income consumers kaiser foundation analyst levitt said 450 billion seems high to him ___ online cea report ___ this story has been corrected to show a quote from the cea report reads reforms not reports
when the traders and investors who advise the u s treasury floated the idea of selling bonds indexed to inflation in health care and education they were drawing on work that nobel laureate robert shiller began a generation ago it s also work that michael ashton a money manager who specializes in hedging specific inflation risk latched onto more than a decade ago that s when he and shiller tried unsuccessfully to create an exchange traded mechanism for hedging the medical care component of the consumer price index being able to trade subcomponents is the holy grail said ashton whose twitter handle is inflation_guy everybody has different exposure to inflation a different experience of it so one size fits all eventually has to go away because not everyone wants a black model t shiller a yale university economics professor had been involved in the creation of a comparable product tied to oil prices and later launched one for single family home prices both efforts ultimately failed and the latest bond proposal may struggle to gain traction still ashton and shiller say that hedging cpi components is a worthy idea whose time will come consider the risks there are a lot of risks people are facing without insurance health care and education among them shiller said in an interview global warming is another he said there are all kinds of assets that should be created the u s began issuing treasury inflation protected securities linked to the cpi in 1997 the idea that the government could sell debt tied to health care and education costs was among those that the treasury borrowing advisory committee presented at the end of last month tbac comprising 17 bond market professionals who relay industry opinion to the nation s domestic finance managers had been asked for a report on how the u s could better handle its growing borrowing need in a list that also included treasuries maturing in 15 20 years perpetual horizon debt and zero coupon bonds tbac said the new tips are likely to result in more cost savings than those linked to the whole cpi basket the current approach is not a good hedge for investors exposed to specific inflation risks the report said for example corporate and state health care plans might prefer tips indexed to medical costs while college savings plans might like education linked securities familiar feeling reading tbac s report at his office in morristown new jersey ashton recognized the rationale for the proposal he d worked on with shiller in 2007 and 2008 in 2004 he d given a presentation on the potential for trading cpi components at a barclays capital inflation linked bond conference in key biscayne florida at the time ashton was in charge of inflation derivatives at barclays in new york ashton says he predicted in key biscayne that within five years people would be trading the components of inflation it s just taking longer than i thought he said ashton s firm enduring investments llc was founded in 2009 and helps clients hedge large or unusual inflation risks tools lacking the topic of ashton s 2004 presentation aligned with work that shiller did for his 1993 book macro markets creating institutions for managing society s largest economic risks the book s main idea is that financial markets lack easily created tools that would allow investors to build portfolios that address individual risks things like this take a long time to get established shiller said people are not as calculating as economists like to assume shiller in 1999 co founded macromarkets llc an investment manager that developed macroshares a legal structure for exchange traded trusts friendlier to individual investors than futures are that would make distributions based on price changes in specific commodities or indexes in 2006 it listed macroshares oil up and macroshares oil down referencing crude oil at the time ashton was working for natixis capital markets making markets in inflation derivatives he pitched shiller s firm on using the macroshares model to list medical care inflation securities and the two took the idea to asset managers including calpers pimco tiaa cref and western asset management market derailed macromarkets in january 2008 filed an offering document for medical inflation up and medical inflation down shares then the financial crisis hit the oil shares stopped trading in mid 2008 macromarkets in mid 2009 listed up and down macroshares tied to the value of the s p case shiller composite 10 home price index they stopped trading in december 2009 though the indexes live on shiller ascribes these failures along with the broader lack of tools available to hedge specific risks to inertia for example fire insurance didn t become widespread until the mortgage industry started demanding it even as cities were ravaged by flames on a regular basis he said the financial industry could issue cpi subcomponent tips on its own comparable to how bond dealers created the first zero coupon treasuries in the early 1980s predating the strips market by several years ashton said that was the vision he had in key biscayne in 2004 tips could be placed in a trust and the separate inflation exposures sold separately the problem he said is that health care and education are relatively small parts of the cpi with weights of about 8 6 percent and 3 percent treasury s role while there are investors who might over pay for specific types of protection you can t sell them expensive enough to make the rest cheap enough to fly off the shelf ashton said that s why direct issuance by the treasury is probably necessary the fed could assist in testing the market for such a product as it rolls off some of the treasuries accumulated during the financial crisis including tips ashton said he laid out that idea in a blog post in september by selling specific inflation exposures and keeping the rest the central bank would likely have the large positive effect of jump starting a really important market
donald trump s tax cut for the rich and the corporations they control is turning out to be a bust for the american economy it will burden taxpayers with at least 1 5 trillion more federal debt because instead of boosting tax revenues through increased economic activity as promised it has caused a sharp drop in revenue in addition millions of residents of blue states are about to get hit with big federal income tax increases while many american expatriates who own businesses overseas are also facing unexpected new tax bills especially if they prudently saved for old age under the systems of the countries where they now reside a host of economic indicators shows the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act failed to achieve its key promise a major increase in investments by business that would create more jobs this is exactly the result that many including those of us at dcreport predicted the economy is slowing down despite the promise that the trump radical republican tax cut would spur massive new investment we call the 2017 tax law the trump radical republican tax law because not one democrat voted for the bill in the house or senate it was also passed without a single public hearing it is a terrible law that benefits the richest among us at the expense of the many and it needs to be fixed the trump radical republican tax law not only cut the corporate tax rate from 35 of profits to 21 it also allowed corporations to immediately deduct 100 of capital expenditures instead of writing them off on their tax returns over periods from three years to decades this kind of corporate tax timing trick has been employed several times since the john f kennedy administration in 1962 the effect each time was to create a brief surge in corporate investment called capital expenditures followed by a slump looked at over a period of several years total capital investment was unchanged the evidence today shows the economy is slowing down after expanding since early in former president barack obama s first term despite the promise that the trump radical republican tax cut would spur massive new investment the national association for business economics found this month that the trump radical republican tax law has failed to increase business investment and activity nabe president kevin swift who is chief economist for then american chemistry council said that 84 of business economists it surveyed agreed that one year after its passage the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act has not caused their firms to change hiring or investment plans there s no reason to expect an increase going forward rather economic growth appears to be slowing the association said that a majority of those it surveyed in january don t expect a recession this year however fewer members expect robust economic growth in 2019 it also noted a slowdown in the growth of profit margins as well as rising costs for materials both signs of an economic expansion that is running out of fuel to keep going manufacturing activity has grown for 116 consecutive months the last 23 of them under trump the institute for supply management s latest report showed but institute reports also showed a sharp slowdown as 2018 ended despite the trump radical republican tax cut favors for business in december the institute s purchasing managers index pmi stood at 54 1 down sharply from 59 3 in november much more worrisome was an 11 point decline in the index for future orders which fell in december from 62 1 to 51 1 that suggests economic growth will slow perhaps even stall later this year expect some contraction in consumer spending in the first half of this year as many prosperous americans get hit with much bigger than expected income tax bills thanks to the trump radical republican tax cut millions of families in california connecticut maryland massachusetts new jersey new york virginia and other high tax states will owe thousands to tens of thousands of dollars more in federal income tax for 2018 even if their income was unchanged from 2017 that is because individuals can deduct no more than 10 000 in state and local taxes known as salt on the tax returns due this spring and most homeowners will no longer be able to deduct mortgage interest the number of taxpayers who will be eligible to itemize deductions is expected to fall from about one in three to just one in 20 the taxpayers most affected live in democratic leaning blue states which also happen to be those with better paying jobs had the trump radical republican tax cut bill been examined in public hearings the public would have known about its partisan provisions something the framers of our constitution warned against and which they tried to prevent with the uniformity clause in article i section 8 clause 1 of our constitution which says taxes should be uniform across the country in addition many american expatriates are being hit hard by trump and congress because their tax deferred retirement savings plans in some countries are now treated as immediately taxable by the united states that s because the law did not distinguish between profits siphoned out of the united states by companies like apple and the normal course of business for many expatriates complying with the laws where they now live congress taxes americans and american based corporations on their worldwide income other major countries tax people only on income earned within their boundaries similarly the equity built up in enterprises such as medical practices is treated as immediately taxable under the trump radical republican tax law these consequences illustrate a key reason that tax law should not be drafted in secret and voted on without public hearings had congress held public hearings the tax problems created for american expatriate professionals and business owner differences in the tax rules of other countries could have been spotted and then prevented or minimized now that the democrats control the house which our constitution requires be the origination point for all tax laws hearings could be held to ameliorate or even eliminate these problems
everything about australia s renewable energy calamity was perfectly predictable and perfectly avoidable throwing 60 000 000 000 in subsidies at chaotically intermittent wind and solar was a pretty good start placing lunatics in charge of the entire operation sealed the deal australia s eastern grid covering qld nsw vic tas act sa is on the brink of collapse under threat every time the temperature rises and with it demand for electricity the wind drops and the sun drops over the horizon south australia its wind and solar capital pays the highest power prices in the world victoria with its own ludicrous 50 renewable energy target is catching up fast it s also coming to experience the mass blackouts and load shedding that wind powered south australians are renowned for worthless wind power australia s re debacle deepens with 200 000 victorian households left powerless during heatwave at times liberal mp craig kelly sounds like the only politician in this country with his head screwed on craig is one of a handful who actually understand the causes and consequences of australia s energy crisis making him rarer still craig has the temerity to tackle head on the cabal of well healed renewable energy rent seekers profiting from the greatest government mandated scam in australian history and to go to toe to toe with the re zealots he merrily infuriates here s craig doing all the above in a cracking interview with 2gb s alan jones liberal mp calls for government to fight completely insane push to renewables 2gb alan jones and craig kelly 4 february 2019 backbencher craig kelly is taking it upon himself to prosecute the government s case for coal fired power the opposition says if it wins the election it will drastically ramp up the use of wind and solar that s despite more than 200 000 homes losing power during victoria s heatwave last month it came a little more than a year since the hazlewood coal fired power plant closed in january 2018 wholesale power prices were 26 10 per megawatt hour in victoria this january with the plant closed the average price was 250 per megawatt hour a jump of around 800 per cent liberal member for hughes craig kelly is calling on his own government to start informing voters of the issue we are the most energy rich nation in the world we export more coal than any other nation we export more lng than any other nation we have more uranium in our ground than anywhere else in the world and yet we ve got this absurd situation we can t afford to keep the lights on in victoria and not only that we are now paying record wholesale prices for electricity if it wasn t so serious you d laugh this is completely insane 2gb alan jones in the last week with the federal election due this year two very important issues have come together in the first place there s been endless publicity for a raft of independence who are going to stand and some most profess liberal connections and are allegedly disenchanted with the liberal party i ll come to that issue after 7 30 suffice to say that s rubbish let me put that simply it is a complete and absolute untruth these people have not a bone of liberal sentiment in their body the second issue here is that the one common factor it appears in their candidature is climate change and they rabbit on about this with religious fervour we have every reason therefore to be concerned we re also told last week that our energy crisis that s the word that s being used the fact that we are resource rich and energy poor is surely a disgrace we were told that our energy crisis will continue over the next two summers why wouldn t it closed down coal fired power stations and those that exist are ageing mr shorten s leading at the polls and he s talking about a 50 renewable energy target last friday week more than 200 000 victorian homes and businesses had their power cut alcoa s australian portland aluminium plant had to power down the cost ran into millions and millions of dollars there s a woman who s the australian energy market operator i made this point on friday when talking to angus taylor she s the bureaucratic head of australia s energy policies she s an american an import a global warming apologist and a renewable energy disciple totally opposed to coal fired power and she s the bureaucrat in charge of energy policy i ve been saying for years this is the national economic suicide note here it is if you can t guarantee availability reliability and affordability you re in trouble the cost of business last week was intolerable lost production means lost orders lost income and lost jobs angus taylor told me on friday the federal government is now going to consider 10 new power generation projects that include coal but if you started one today it ll be years before you had the energy that s required to avoid the energy crisis that has been forecast for the next two summers angus taylor said the government had received 66 submissions two for clean coal plants what the hell are the other 64 are about i ve got no idea but i made the point to him that trevor st baker the founder of erm power had provided the same angus taylor with a six billion dollar plan to develop high efficiency low emission coal fired power plants at hazelwood in victoria and liddell in new south wales and he handed that proposal to the minister on january 16 it s now february 4 mr baker said the obvious the whole country knows we have a shortage of reliable power with at least a 1000 megawatt gap in victoria new south wales has no spare capacity and south australia is a basket case well wholly reliant south australia on renewable energy we saw what happened there two years ago these high efficiency low emission hilly plants would produce reliable electricity coal fired for as little as 40 a megawatt hour gas is 115 a megawatt hour solar is 171 and wind you can forget why wouldn t the greenies support clean coal why doesn t the government have shovels in the ground today victoria will be the basket case that south australia is victoria have lost 25 of their power with the hazelwood coal fired power station closing down 62 countries are building or planning 1600 new coal fired power plants we have six and we re going to get rid of them to save the planet there is no proposal to build any power station be it coal or nuclear or gas and if a decision were taken tomorrow it would take three years to build a power station so we ve gotta continue for another two years with subsidies to solar and wind between 2000 and 3000 million a year and the prospect of what happened two fridays ago being ever present one of the few people that make sense in all of this is the federal member for hughes liberal member craig kelly and the lefties hate him malcolm turnbull hates him because of his views thank god he keeps on and he s right here beside me good morning to you craig kelly yes good morning alan alan jones could i just ask you a question a very brief question about the floods now people are saying to me here is water like we ve never seen before none of it s harvested none of it s harvested we could actually water the whole of queensland and new south wales and yet the 75 billion has been spent on subsidies to renewable energy craig kelly 75 000 million alan that s what we ve spent at the moment on building wind farms and solar farms now if we had ve instead of put that money into the bradfield scheme and we re a land of drought and flooding rains we have been dorothea mackellar wrote that over 100 years ago it s been exactly the same over the last century we can do something about that we can t do something about changing the weather but we can do something about watering australia the bradfield scheme is there it just takes we make sure we get our priorities right alan jones i agree you had this if we re going back to friday last friday week this victorian energy minister they ve just had an election then they won in a landslide lily d ambrosio she told us that the temperatures were going to go to about 42 degrees and she said this blackouts are something that will absolutely not be a feature of today or even a possibility craig kelly unbelievable and look what actually went then she tried to blame it on the coal fired power now this is the government down there a labor government that closed down hazelwood they chased it out of town by tripling the coal royalties and they said look we can get by without hazelwood we won t alan jones going too quickly just make that point again they tripled the coal royalties which made coal fired power further unviable but you ll remember that in your government led by turnbull abbott said it must stay open turnbull said no craig kelly i can remember when hazelwood was closing and we argued black and blue something had to be done to try and keep hazelwood alan jones 25 craig kelly all the experts told us now look we don t need hazelwood not a problem we can do without it now we were mugged by reality and what happened last week where we saw was it something like 200 000 victorians went without power and it wasn t the coal fired power stations to blame this is where the minister the energy minister in victoria misled the public she tried to blame the coal fired power stations but what happened the numbers are very clear she made that announcement at 10 00 am in the morning and what happened between 10 00 am and 12 00 am 12 noon when the lights went out it was the wind that dropped off alan jones that s it craig kelly wind power fell from 900 mega watts to down to around 400 500 megawatts of actually wind power fell in half that s why they were short of power that s why they have the blackouts this will happen over and over again until we wake up and realise you must have enough base load power in the system we don t have that in victoria we don t have that in south australia and when liddell closes were on a knife edge in new south wales alan jones well that s what i keep saying see it s got to be available reliable and affordable solar and wind are none of those three craig kelly we are the most energy rich nation in the world we export more coal than any other nation we export more lng than any other nation we have more uranium in our ground than anywhere else in the world yet we ve got these absurd situations we can t afford to keep the lights on in victoria and knowing that we are now paying record record wholesale prices for electricity alan jones yes craig kelly what happened you have a look at the numbers we go back when hazelwood and the northern power station were in the system 2015 the average price in victoria wholesale price was 26 10 in january this january it s been 250 a megawatt hour the average price that s an increase of over 800 this is what has happened in victoria alan jones this is craig kelly the federal liberal member for hughes speaking to me here in the studio without a note without a note we need people who know their stuff who don t read a bureaucratic script just go back to the point you made before last thursday week you talk about wind and solar wind and i saw some figures last night contributed about 3 craig kelly 3 yes just farcical even last friday alan in south australia when they got to their peak demand at about 8 20 in the afternoon wind was supplying 0 7 alan jones that s it craig kelly not even 1 when they needed the electricity most this is why the more renewables you put in the system the more costly electricity becomes because you are paying twice you re paying once alan jones once you get the renewables craig kelly that s it you re paying once for the renewables and you re paying once for the subsidies and you re paying once again to back it all up alan jones but the key here is that in simple language which is subsidised or not renewable energy can t produce reliable power full stop craig kelly it can t alan they ve been running this line the advocates of renewable saying oh we can do this with a big battery look at south australia s big battery now again the fallacy of this was shown the other week what happened on that hot day that big battery cut in a 4 30 pm pumping in 30 megawatts to the south australian grid that s 1 1 of south australia s grid when it got to 7 30 when the power peaked out it had run out of steam and it stopped alan jones yeah craig kelly remember that 30 megawatts the world s biggest battery is 0 1 of our total demand in the national grid 0 1 of the biggest battery alan jones but then you ve got outstanding prosecution of the case then you come back to this energy minister and suddenly everything she said at 10 00 in the morning was proven wrong the victorian d ambrosio she then said well i understand that any loss of power however brief is a worry and that s something we would all rather avoid and not see happen people should be rightly disappointed that the power grid was not up to the task then she said last friday week sitting in ambitious renewable energy target listen to this of 50 by 2030 will boost jobs and investment across regional victoria as well as drive down power prices victorian businesses and families i mean the woman should be out of a job craig kelly but you have to actually laugh and if it wasn t so serious you d laugh the jobs that these solar farms that they re talking about created all the jobs are created in china the jobs in australia are labour labour is unpacking the containers and squeegee men going around with window washers trying to keep the dust off the solar panels for every job created that way we lose two or three or four or five real jobs in the real economy that provide australia s competitive advantage of low cost energy which we ve given away alan jones well i mean as you ve said many times i don t understand why after friday this wasn t that your government didn t say listen drip down tools this is the one story we re gotta prosecute now night and day now you ve said the blackouts have demonstrated the dangerous stupidity of believing that you can replace base load coal fired power like hazelwood with wind and solar you can t do it craig kelly well and this is the test coming up at the election labor and bill shorten said look what happened in south australia we wanna copy that and we re gonna roll it out nationwide now any common sense person that looks at this has got to say this is completely insane the south australian experiment with 50 renewable energy has been an unmitigated disaster for that state it s tripled electricity prices it s given them unreliable suppliers it s threatened the economy and yet bill shorten says we wanna copy this and take it nationwide alan jones but craig it s here now 32 000 new south wales families have had their electricity disconnected as a result of the fact they can t pay their bill pardon me more than 18 are on a hardship payment of families in new south wales 18 because their power bills have jumped by almost 20 and if you ask the salvation army and st vincent de paul they ve got people coming to them asking for help with electricity bills and disconnections craig kelly the electricity disconnections in south australia per capita are 50 higher than what they are in new south wales so if bill shorten brings that policy in we re gonna see more people unable to afford their electricity bills and more people disconnected just think for a minute how you would go about the next week if you had no electricity at your home it means no air conditioning it means you don t have a fridge you have to keep your fridge closed you don t have a washing machine it means you go back to basically a lifestyle of over 150 years ago it causes pain and hardship in our nation alan jones but you ve got i mean one of the criticisms of theresa may in brexit is that her critics say well you were a remainer anyway how can you prosecute the exit strategy here you ve got the leading bureaucrat in this country that s not an australian she s an american this audrey zibelman she is the leading bureaucrat and she is a renewable energy fanatic how on earth can a liberal government allow her to continue to dictate energy policy craig kelly well she was appointed under the former prime minister and i was critical of her appointment at the time alan jones yep craig kelly her comments are basically to people that go with that suck it up this is she s running this ideological experiment where she wants to have all these solar panels all over the place without a concern of what it s going to cost and also without a concern someone coming from new york has no idea what it is like living in western sydney when the temperature gets over 40 degrees and you need to keep your air conditioning on craig kelly the idea that we just she s got this idea we just shut the power down and turn it off when we have high demand but this must be deemed as unacceptable alan jones absolutely good on you craig keep at it there s craig kelly this is a major crisis can the morrison government that s a member of it but he s a back bencher can the morrison government grapple with this and prosecute the case 2gb
by corina pons and maria ramirez el callao venezuela reuters venezuela s most successful financial operations in recent years have not taken place on wall street but in primitive gold mining camps in the nation s southern reaches with the country s economy in meltdown an estimated 300 000 fortune hunters have descended on this mineral rich jungle area to earn a living pulling gold flecked earth from makeshift mines their picks and shovels are helping to prop up the leftist government of president nicolas maduro since 2016 his administration has purchased 17 tonnes of the metal worth around 650 million from so called artisan miners according to the most recent data from the nation s central bank paid with the country s near worthless bank notes these amateurs in turn supply the government with hard currency to purchase badly needed imports of food and hygiene products this gold trade is a blip on international markets still the united states is using sanctions and intimidation in an effort to stop maduro from using his nation s gold to stay afloat the trump administration is pressuring the united kingdom not to release 1 2 billion in gold reserves venezuela has stored in the bank of england u s officials recently castigated an abu dhabi based investment firm for its venezuela gold purchases and have warned other potential foreign buyers to back off the existence of maduro s gold program is well known how it functions is not to get a glimpse inside reuters tracked venezuela s gold from steamy jungle mines through the central bank in the capital of caracas to gold refineries and food exporters abroad speaking with more than 30 people with knowledge of the trade they included miners intermediaries merchants academic researchers diplomats and government officials almost all requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly or because they feared retribution from venezuelan or u s authorities what emerges is the portrait of a desperate experiment in laissez faire industrial policy by venezuela s socialist leaders u s sanctions have hammered the nation s oil industry and crippled its ability to borrow the formal mining sector has been decimated by nationalization so maduro has unleashed freelance prospectors to extract the nation s mineral wealth with virtually no regulation or state investment the bolivarian revolution now leans heavily on ragtag laborers such as jose aular a teenager who says he has contracted malaria five times at a wildcat mine near venezuela s border with brazil aular works 12 hours daily lugging sacks of earth to a small mill that uses toxic mercury to extract flecks of precious metal mining accidents are common in these ramshackle operations workers said so are shootings and robberies the government knows what happens in these mines and it benefits from it said aular 18 our gold goes into their hands maduro has also received a crucial assist from turkish president tayyip erdogan a fellow strongman who has likewise sparred with the trump administration venezuela sells most of its gold to turkish refineries then uses some of the proceeds to buy that nation s consumer goods according to people with direct knowledge of the trade turkish pasta and powdered milk are now staples in maduro s subsidized food program trade between the two nations grew eightfold last year but scrutiny is intensifying as venezuela s politics reach the boiling point in recent days many western countries have recognized venezuela s opposition leader juan guaido as the south american nation s rightful president maduro s adversaries have called on foreign buyers of venezuela s precious metal to stop doing business with what they say is an illegitimate regime we are going to protect our gold opposition legislator carlos paparoni told reuters in an interview gold fever the gold road begins in places like la culebra an isolated jungle area in southern venezuela

donald trump s tax cut for the rich and the corporations they control is turning out to be a bust for the american economy it will burden taxpayers with at least 1 5 trillion more federal debt because instead of boosting tax revenues through increased economic activity as promised it has caused a sharp drop in revenue in addition millions of residents of blue states are about to get hit with big federal income tax increases while many american expatriates who own businesses overseas are also facing unexpected new tax bills especially if they prudently saved for old age under the systems of the countries where they now reside a host of economic indicators shows the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act failed to achieve its key promise a major increase in investments by business that would create more jobs this is exactly the result that many including those of us at dcreport predicted the economy is slowing down despite the promise that the trump radical republican tax cut would spur massive new investment we call the 2017 tax law the trump radical republican tax law because not one democrat voted for the bill in the house or senate it was also passed without a single public hearing it is a terrible law that benefits the richest among us at the expense of the many and it needs to be fixed the trump radical republican tax law not only cut the corporate tax rate from 35 of profits to 21 it also allowed corporations to immediately deduct 100 of capital expenditures instead of writing them off on their tax returns over periods from three years to decades this kind of corporate tax timing trick has been employed several times since the john f kennedy administration in 1962 the effect each time was to create a brief surge in corporate investment called capital expenditures followed by a slump looked at over a period of several years total capital investment was unchanged the evidence today shows the economy is slowing down after expanding since early in former president barack obama s first term despite the promise that the trump radical republican tax cut would spur massive new investment the national association for business economics found this month that the trump radical republican tax law has failed to increase business investment and activity nabe president kevin swift who is chief economist for then american chemistry council said that 84 of business economists it surveyed agreed that one year after its passage the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act has not caused their firms to change hiring or investment plans there s no reason to expect an increase going forward rather economic growth appears to be slowing the association said that a majority of those it surveyed in january don t expect a recession this year however fewer members expect robust economic growth in 2019 it also noted a slowdown in the growth of profit margins as well as rising costs for materials both signs of an economic expansion that is running out of fuel to keep going manufacturing activity has grown for 116 consecutive months the last 23 of them under trump the institute for supply management s latest report showed but institute reports also showed a sharp slowdown as 2018 ended despite the trump radical republican tax cut favors for business in december the institute s purchasing managers index pmi stood at 54 1 down sharply from 59 3 in november much more worrisome was an 11 point decline in the index for future orders which fell in december from 62 1 to 51 1 that suggests economic growth will slow perhaps even stall later this year expect some contraction in consumer spending in the first half of this year as many prosperous americans get hit with much bigger than expected income tax bills thanks to the trump radical republican tax cut millions of families in california connecticut maryland massachusetts new jersey new york virginia and other high tax states will owe thousands to tens of thousands of dollars more in federal income tax for 2018 even if their income was unchanged from 2017 that is because individuals can deduct no more than 10 000 in state and local taxes known as salt on the tax returns due this spring and most homeowners will no longer be able to deduct mortgage interest the number of taxpayers who will be eligible to itemize deductions is expected to fall from about one in three to just one in 20 the taxpayers most affected live in democratic leaning blue states which also happen to be those with better paying jobs had the trump radical republican tax cut bill been examined in public hearings the public would have known about its partisan provisions something the framers of our constitution warned against and which they tried to prevent with the uniformity clause in article i section 8 clause 1 of our constitution which says taxes should be uniform across the country in addition many american expatriates are being hit hard by trump and congress because their tax deferred retirement savings plans in some countries are now treated as immediately taxable by the united states that s because the law did not distinguish between profits siphoned out of the united states by companies like apple and the normal course of business for many expatriates complying with the laws where they now live congress taxes americans and american based corporations on their worldwide income other major countries tax people only on income earned within their boundaries similarly the equity built up in enterprises such as medical practices is treated as immediately taxable under the trump radical republican tax law these consequences illustrate a key reason that tax law should not be drafted in secret and voted on without public hearings had congress held public hearings the tax problems created for american expatriate professionals and business owner differences in the tax rules of other countries could have been spotted and then prevented or minimized now that the democrats control the house which our constitution requires be the origination point for all tax laws hearings could be held to ameliorate or even eliminate these problems
on monday january 28 the department of the treasury of the united states announced it was placing a block on all of petróleos de venezuela s pdvsa assets under us jurisdiction prohibiting its citizens from engaging in any type of transaction with the venezuelan state owned oil company secretary steve mnuchin added that if the people of venezuela want to continue to sell us oil we will only accept it on the condition that our money goes to blocked accounts which would later be made available for the transition government according to national security advisor john bolton the sanctions imposed on pdvsa would provoke a loss of some 11 billion dollars in exports for 2019 and a freeze on 7 billion dollars in assets on january 24th bolton declared on fox business it will make a big difference to the united states economically if we could have american oil companies invest in and produce the oil capabilities in venezuela just three minutes before effectively confessing the true intentions of us imperialism bolton asserted that chávez and maduro had impoverished venezuela we now have between three and four million refugees who have fled the country something unprecedented in the history of the western hemisphere maduro and hugo chávez before him systematically looted the oil resources of the country there is no capital investment and income is declining society is literally collapsing in venezuela these factors bolton continued provide the justification for the trump administration s recognition of juan guaidó as interim president a few hours after sanctions were publicly announced on january 29 the venezuelan national assembly approved an agreement for the promotion of a national rescue plan which upheld that venezuela was experiencing a social and economic collapse that had produced a humanitarian emergency consequence of the policies of the regime of nicolás maduro which has installed a totalitarian economic and political model for domination and social control otherwise known as 21st century socialism behold a concise summary of the way in which foreign and local agents put in practice what naomi klein defined as disaster capitalism in her formidable shock doctrine a useful framework for understanding what is happening in venezuela at a time when forces are conspiring to severely if possible irreparably affect our ability to interpret our own present with disaster capitalism klein refers to orchestrated raids on the public sphere in the wake of catastrophic events combined with the treatment of disasters as exciting market opportunities it took place first in chile under the pinochet dictatorship but also in new orleans following hurricane katrina in sri lanka after the 2004 tsunami in iraq after the us invasion of 2003 in the us after the attacks of september 11 2001 in china after tiananmen in 1993 under yeltsin s russia and so on in each case klein explains the attacks were led by fanatical neoliberals who gave no quarter in their application of austerity policies this is exactly what is taking place in venezuela compounded by the fact that the shock is largely induced by the local venezuelan elite acting in lockstep with us imperialism each drawing on the support of their respective social base fundamentally composed of middle and upper classes the class component of the shock recalls the history of salvador allende s government in both cases democratic governments with a socialist orientation elected by popular vote are systematically put under siege their respective economies asphyxiated in order to create the conditions for a violent solution that would neutralize the popular classes inclined to support revolutionary change in a recent declaration by alfonso guerra the spanish ex president claimed that nicolás maduro was comparable to the pinochet government an assertion all the more obscene for the reasons outlined above according to guerra venezuela is suffering under a dictatorship that on top of everything else is incompetent dictatorships often undermine liberty but at least they act efficiently in the economic sphere he then added there is a difference between the horrible pinochet dictatorship and that of maduro in the first the economy did not collapse and in the second it did the current disaster of the venezuelan economy is not the work of 21st century socialism as the national assembly would have it nor the incompetence of the government instead it is fundamentally the handiwork of local and global capitalist powers combined with the political difficulties the bolivarian revolution faces in its attempts to manage the conflict in favor the popular majority venezuela is today suffering a textbook case of disaster capitalism ii in the dominant narrative the situation in venezuela has been interpreted as an emergency but above all as a humanitarian crisis it will remain for a later date to fully understand the historical conditions that have enabled the use of the humanitarian concept however taking as a reference point articles published in a us propaganda organ such as voice of america it is possible to trace the concept s usage back to 2014 curiously it first appears in connection with the right to freedom of expression on march 31 of that year in the midst of the second wave of anti chavista violence directed against the maduro government rodrigo diamanti an economist from the catholic university andrés bello and president of the ngo a world without censorship declared that the political crisis in venezuela combined with the economic and social crisis is fueling a humanitarian crisis contrary to all evidence diamanti stated that the government had violated the right to political demonstration and had launched a persecutory campaign in social networks throughout 2014 the humanitarian discourse was employed in relation to the situation in the health sector this time it was josé manuel olivares a medical resident at the university hospital of caracas and specialist in oncological radiotherapy who spoke out against the humanitarian crisis that the country is currently suffering voice of america failed to inform that olivares was then a militant with the rightwing party primero justicia in fact he is currently a deputy in the national assembly elected by the state of vargas in the 2015 parliamentary elections as was deputy juan guaidó by 2015 the term had become a permanent fixture on february 24 the think tank international crisis group issued a report in which it warned that venezuela would be facing a humanitarian crisis if measures were not taken to solve the country s problems a couple weeks later on march 9 the obama administration declared venezuela an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the united states imposing sanctions on seven officials allegedly involved in human rights violations in an article dated to march 11 josé manuel oliveras spoke in the name of an ngo known as doctors for health again asserting that the country was experiencing a a humanitarian health crisis republican marco rubio weighed in with his own declaration the next day while individual economic sanctions against infractions of human rights announced earlier this week has focused on the catastrophe that nicolás maduro and his regime have inflicted on the venezuelans there must be more action and attention paid to the humanitarian and economic crisis that threatens regional security that same day the secretary of state john kerry assured that if venezuela were to cease its oil assistance to neighboring countries a humanitarian crisis could be unleashed from that moment onward the anti chavista voices would employ the term with increasing frequency by 2016 with the national assembly under opposition control that institution became a sounding board for the same kind of discourse on january 26 it issued a statement on the humanitarian crisis in health in venezuela due to the scarcity of medications medical supplies and the deterioration of health infrastructure while on february 11 it announced a humanitarian crisis and the complete absence of any form of food security for the venezuelan population on january 23 the team at misión verdad published a report providing information that showed the fallacy behind the cartelized discourses sustaining the lack of dollars as a fundamental cause for the restriction of medication which is produced oligopolistically by a handful of pharmaceutical corporations based in the country on february 15 journalist victor hugo majano warned the national assembly s declaration of a dietary and pharmaceutical emergency is meant to force the government into maintaining flows of foreign currency that are in turn used to finance imports typically by the commercial layer of the bourgeoisie and transnational corporations that are dedicated to the commercialization of consumer goods even having only sketched a tentative relation between the available facts and given the historical conditions in which this type of discourse emerges and the type of language it uses not to mention its principal motives it seems clear that when there is talk of a humanitarian crisis in venezuela it comes in the form of a self fulfilling prophecy those who speak a humanitarian language more than warning against what could happen are anticipating a reality that they themselves are deeply invested in seeing materialized apart from that they are posing the problem as the exclusive responsibility of the government from which can only follow a single solution humanitarian intervention this is critical to understand there is no crisis without intervention another effect is the progressive degradation of political language the humanitarianization of discourse is the most recent expression of an attempt to dehumanize chavismo it is inherent to anti chavismo the hordes from the first years of the bolivarian revolution are then made out to be criminal accomplices of a genocidal dictator i e nicolás maduro who furthermore is a usurper like the equally illegitimate hugo chávez the virulence of the recent attacks against chavismo regarded as a despicable and vile phenomenon subject to legitimate extermination does not answer to any humanitarian crisis it is the same virulence as twenty years earlier fomented by the brutality that is today expressed in venezuela s disaster capitalism the humanitarianization of political discourse is the intricate plot upon which the trump administration looks to legitimize their attack on the pdvsa it is justified on the grounds that as john bolton stated on fox business on january 24 the government in question is genocidal and corrupt so what is the trick the trick is that this discursive plot serves to muddy the waters anyone who should question the humanitarian discourse has simply failed to recognize or worse justified the crisis and corruption by the same sleight of hand the main parties responsible for the catastrophe are the ones exempt from any responsibility iii the humanitarian crisis is a business opportunity as bolton acknowledged in his fox business interview the same opportunities are also on display in the plans being promoted by the national assembly on december 19 2018 a proposal was put before the national assembly the plan for the country the day after the plan offers a roadmap for what is to be expected during the democratic transition according to banking and business the plan outlines the reactivation of the productive apparatus by accessing the finances of multilateral banking read the international monetary fund removal of all controls regulations and bureaucratic obstacles and punitive measures international investment within a regulatory framework that creates confidence and effective protection of private property opening for private investment in public enterprises approval of a new hydrocarbon law that would allow for private capital to act as a majority shareholder in oil projects the private sector will be responsible for the operation of utility assets efficiency in order to reduce the size of the state on social matters the proposal aims to supply and provide continuous access to primary goods and services with special focus on the sectors of health education and nutrition for the most vulnerable encouraging quality employment and protection of family income on january 8 2019 a bill proposal was circulated in the national assembly with the title statute governing the transition to democracy and the reestablishment of the validity of the constitution of the bolivarian republic of venezuela article 21 of the bill reads the national assembly will issue the laws necessary to deal with the complex humanitarian emergency and promote the recovery of the venezuelan economy in conformity with the agreement of plan país approved on december 18 2018 the same article goes on to list the objectives it will accomplish rapid economic recuperation through extraordinary international financial assistance provided by multilateral organisms paragraph 1 centralized control arbitrary measures for expropriation and other similar measures will all be abolished including currency control to that end the centralized model for economic control will be replaced by a model based on liberty and the market founded on the right enjoyed by each venezuelan to work under the guarantees based on property and freedom of enterprise paragraph 2 public utilities will be subject to a process of restructuring that assures efficient and transparent management including through public private arrangements paragraph 4 clearly plan país and the transition bill proposal are both rife with neoliberal measures deregulation massive privatization including pdvsa restructuring of the state etc and as for social concerns given that the issue at hand is nothing less than a humanitarian crisis and that the magnitude of such a crisis would logically occupy a central place in any democratic transition plan the proposed social measures are little more than a scaled back version of the policies implemented throughout the bolivarian revolution such is the deceptive nature of venezuela s disaster capitalists they promise to return the country to the years of chávez which in their thinking was destroyed by the very same 21st century socialism however they also intend to apply the same neoliberal policies of the 80s and 90s which fueled the first rebellions of the venezuelan people reinaldo antonio iturriza lópez puerto ordaz bolívar venezuela november 30 1973 is a venezuelan politician sociologist and writer he was the

this february 12 story corrects to remove reference to istanbul gold refinery igr by corina pons and maria ramirez with the country s economy in meltdown an estimated 300 000 fortune hunters have descended on this mineral rich jungle area to earn a living pulling gold flecked earth from makeshift mines their picks and shovels are helping to prop up the leftist government of president nicolas maduro since 2016 his administration has purchased 17 tonnes of the metal worth around 650 million 499 million pounds from so called artisan miners according to the most recent data from the nation s central bank paid with the country s near worthless bank notes these amateurs in turn supply the government with hard currency to purchase badly needed imports of food and hygiene products this gold trade is a blip on international markets still the united states is using sanctions and intimidation in an effort to stop maduro from using his nation s gold to stay afloat the trump administration is pressuring the united kingdom not to release 1 2 billion in gold reserves venezuela has stored in the bank of england u s officials recently castigated an abu dhabi based investment firm for its venezuela gold purchases and have warned other potential foreign buyers to back off the existence of maduro s gold program is well known how it functions is not to get a glimpse inside reuters tracked venezuela s gold from steamy jungle mines through the central bank in the capital of caracas to gold refineries and food exporters abroad speaking with more than 30 people with knowledge of the trade they included miners intermediaries merchants academic researchers diplomats and government officials almost all requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly or because they feared retribution from venezuelan or u s authorities what emerges is the portrait of a desperate experiment in laissez faire industrial policy by venezuela s socialist leaders u s sanctions have hammered the nation s oil industry and crippled its ability to borrow the formal mining sector has been decimated by nationalization so maduro has unleashed freelance prospectors to extract the nation s mineral wealth with virtually no regulation or state investment the bolivarian revolution now leans heavily on ragtag laborers such as jose aular a teenager who says he has contracted malaria five times at a wildcat mine near venezuela s border with brazil aular works 12 hours daily lugging sacks of earth to a small mill that uses toxic mercury to extract flecks of precious metal mining accidents are common in these ramshackle operations workers said so are shootings and robberies the government knows what happens in these mines and it benefits from it said aular 18 our gold goes into their hands maduro has also received a crucial assist from turkish president tayyip erdogan a fellow strongman who has likewise sparred with the trump administration venezuela exports part of its gold to turkey then uses some of the proceeds to buy that nation s consumer goods according to opposition legislator carlos paparoni turkish pasta and powdered milk are now staples in maduro s subsidized food program trade between the two nations grew eightfold last year but scrutiny is intensifying as venezuela s politics reach the boiling point in recent days many western countries have recognized venezuela s opposition leader juan guaido as the south american nation s rightful president maduro s adversaries have called on foreign buyers of venezuela s precious metal to stop doing

by pepe escobar via the strategic culture foundation zerohedge com sun 02 10 2019 cold war 2 0 has hit south america with a bang pitting the us and expected minions against the four key pillars of in progress eurasia integration russia china iran and turkey it s the oil stupid but there s way more than meets the oily eye caracas has committed the ultimate cardinal sin in the eyes of exceptionalistan oil trading bypassing the us dollar or us controlled exchanges remember iraq remember libya yet iran is also doing it turkey is doing it russia is partially on the way and china will eventually trade all its energy in petroyuan with venezuela adopting the petro crypto currency and the sovereign bolivar already last year the trump administration had sanctioned caracas off the international financial system no wonder caracas is supported by china russia and iran they are the real hardcore troika not psycho killer john bolton s cartoonish troika of tyranny fighting against the trump administration s energy dominance strategy which consists essentially in aiming at the total lock down of oil trading in petrodollars forever venezuela is a key cog in the machine psycho killer bolton admitted it on the record it will make a big difference to the united states economically if we could have american oil companies invest in and produce the oil capabilities in venezuela it s not a matter of just letting exxonmobil take over venezuela s massive oil reserves the largest on the planet the key is to monopolize their exploitation in us dollars benefitting a few big oil billionaires once again the curse of natural resources is in play venezuela must not be allowed to profit from its wealth on its own terms thus exceptionalistan has ruled that the venezuelan state must be shattered in the end this is all about economic war cue to the us treasury department imposing new sanctions on pdvsa that amount to a de facto oil embargo against venezuela once again the curse of natural resources is in play venezuela must not be allowed to profit from its wealth on its own terms thus exceptionalistan has ruled that the venezuelan state must be shattered in the end this is all about economic war cue to the us treasury department imposing new sanctions on pdvsa that amount to a de facto oil embargo against venezuela economic war redux by now it s firmly established what happened in caracas was not a color revolution but an old school us promoted regime change coup using local comprador elites installing as interim president an unknown quantity juan guaido with his obama choirboy looks masking extreme right wing credentials everyone remembers assad must go the first stage in the syrian color revolution was the instigation of civil war followed by a war by proxy via multinational jihadi mercenaries as thierry meyssan has noted the role of the arab league then is performed by the oas now and the role of friends of syria now lying in the dustbin of history is now performed by the lima group the club of washington s vassals instead of al nusra moderate rebels we may have colombian or assorted emirati trained moderate rebel mercenaries contrary to western corporate media fake news the latest elections in venezuela were absolutely legitimate there was no way to tamper with the made in taiwan electronic voting machines the ruling socialist party got 70 percent of the votes the opposition with many parties boycotting it got 30 percent a serious delegation of the latin american council of electoral experts ceela was adamant the election reflected peacefully and without problems the will of venezuelan citizens the american embargo may be vicious in parallel maduro s government may have been supremely incompetent in not diversifying the economy and investing in food self sufficiency major food importers speculating like there s no tomorrow are making a killing still reliable sources in caracas tell that the barrios the popular neighborhoods remain largely peaceful in a country where a full tank of gas still costs less than a can of coke there s no question the chronic shortages of food and medicines in local clinics have forced at least two million people to leave venezuela but the key enforcing factor is the us embargo the un rapporteur to venezuela expert on international law and former secretary of the un human rights council alfred de zayas goes straight to the point much more than engaging in the proverbial demonization of maduro washington is waging economic war against a whole nation it s enlightening to see how the venezuelan people see the charade in a poll conducted by hinterlaces even before the trump administration coup regime change wet dream 86 of venezuelans said they were against any sort of us intervention military or not and 81 of venezuelans said they were against us sanctions so much for benign foreign interference on behalf of democracy and human rights the russia china factor analyses by informed observers such as eva golinger and most of all the mision verdad collective are extremely helpful what s certain in true empire of chaos mode is that the american playbook beyond the embargo and sabotage is to foment civil war dodgy armed groups have been active in the caracas barrios acting in the dead of night and amplifying social unrest on social media still guaido holds absolutely no power inside the country his only chance of success is if he manages to install a parallel government cashing in on the oil revenue and having washington arrest government members on trumped up charges irrespective of neocon wet dreams adults at the pentagon should know that an invasion of venezuela may indeed metastasize into a tropical vietnam quagmire the brazilian strongman in waiting vice president and retired general hamilton mourao already said there will be no military intervention psycho killer bolton s by now infamous notepad stunt about 5 000 troops to colombia is a joke these would have no chance against the arguably 15 000 cubans who are in charge of security for the maduro government cubans have demonstrated historically they are not in the business of handing over power it all comes back to what china and russia may do china is venezuela s largest creditor maduro was received by xi jinping last year in beijing getting an extra 5 billion in loans and signing at least 20 bilateral agreements president putin offered his full support to maduro over the phone diplomatically stressing that destructive interference from abroad blatantly violates basic norms of international law by january 2016 oil was as low as 35 a barrel a disaster to venezuela s coffers maduro then decided to transfer 49 9 of the state ownership in pdvsa s us subsidiary citgo to russian rosneft for a mere 1 5 billion loan this had to send a wave of red lights across the beltway those evil russians were now part owners of venezuela s prime asset late last year still in need of more funds maduro opened gold mining in venezuela to russian mining companies and there s more nickel diamonds iron ore aluminum bauxite all coveted by russia china and the us as for 1 3 billion of venezuela s own gold forget about repatriating it from the bank of england and then last december came the straw that broke the deep state s back the friendship flight of two russian nuclear capable tu 160 bombers how dare they in our own backyard the trump administration s energy masterplan may be indeed to annex venezuela to a parallel north american south american petroleum exporting countries nasapec cartel capable of rivaling the opec love story between russia and the house of saud but even if that came to fruition and adding a possible joint us qatar lng alliance there s no guarantee that would be enough to assure petrodollar and petrogas preeminence in the long run eurasia energy integration will mostly bypass the petrodollar this is at the very heart of both the brics and sco strategy from nord stream 2 to turk stream russia is locking down a long term energy partnership with europe and petroyuan dominance is just a matter of time moscow knows it tehran knows it ankara knows it riyadh knows it so what about plan b neocons ready for your tropical vietnam

whenever the next recession does arrive what we know today is that it is unlikely to be a normal recession by the standards of what most people have experienced in their lifetimes in this analysis we will compare and contrast the characteristics of an average recession based on 164 years of history versus what has been experienced in the united states since the end of world war ii for most of the modern era we have experienced unusually short and infrequent recessions specifically because of how federal reserve interventions have changed the business cycle the issue for investors in general and retirement investors in particular is that the fed is trapped inside of a box of its own making and it appears highly likely to enter the next recession without the necessary tools to exit that recession in the way that most people now take for granted what history shows us is that lacking those interventions recessions become more frequent average recessions become much longer and the average investor and retiree is likely to spend twice as much of their lifetime in recessions indeed as explored herein what 164 years of economic history show us is that the so called great recession of 2007 to 2009 was not an aberration but was merely average if the united states were to return to the long term averages for what recessions have been when the fed lacks the necessary ammunition to quickly exit a recession then we could expect a new great recession about once every five years this then has potentially extraordinary implications for future investment results as well as financial and retirement planning this analysis is part of a series of related analyses an overview of the rest of the series is linked here prior analyses as explored in a previous analysis in this series linked here over the last 164 years we have seen 34 cycles of recession and expansion in the united states this business cycle could be likened to the natural cycle of nighttime and daytime the sun has gone down 34 times in the form of recessions and the sun has then come up 34 times in the form of expansions however since the end of world war ii we have seen a quite different and visually obvious change in the frequency and duration of recessions versus expansions the green areas of expansion are fatter and of longer duration and the gold areas of recession are thinner and less frequent as covered in the prior analysis linked here and as can be seen above the federal reserve has been following a monetary policy of responding to recessions in process or the imminent threat of recessions by rapid and major reductions in interest rates and it has been doing this with 100 percent reliability this consistency is because smashing down interest rates is the fed s sole historically proven tool for reducing the length of recessions or at least the sole major tool whenever we enter a recession the fed essentially swings a sledgehammer downwards there is nothing subtle about this process and by this application of brute force it attempts to jolt the economy out of recession as can be seen on the right hand side of the green and gold graph of the 34 cycles what we ve been getting over the last nearly 70 years is shorter and less frequent recessions than was the historical norm over the entire period since 1854 because this material change in the business cycle has been true for most or all of our lifetimes this has now come to be viewed as the natural recession cycle by people they believe that this is just the way expansions and recessions work however that s not actually the case instead what we have experienced is a change in the natural recession cycle that is highly dependent on the modern federal reserve interest rate cycle since the federal reserve has adopted these modern monetary policies with the most important one being the application of brute force through dramatically slashing interest rates we ve seen a major change in the characteristics of the average business cycle since 1946 and the advent of modern monetary policies recessions have on average occurred less frequently we have moved from the 58 month average business cycle that is shown in the top graph to the 80 month business cycle that is shown in the bottom graph the recessions are shorter we moved from an average of 18 months to an average recession of 12 months which is a decrease of 33 percent the expansions are longer we moved from a 40 month average expansion to a 68 month average expansion which is an increase of 70 percent the above comparisons are based on 1854 to 2018 versus 1946 to 2018 the differences are of course more dramatic if 1854 to 1945 is compared to 1946 to 2018 if we compare the relative number of years that are spent in recession versus expansion then as shown in the two pie charts above there has been a drastic change over the entire 164 years we could on average expect to spend about 31 of our lives in recessions and the remaining 69 would be in expansions since the end of world war ii when the federal reserve began its policy of smashing interest rates down by a very large extent every time it believed a recession was either underway or imminent the time spent in recession is down to about 15 percent with about 85 of our lives spent in expansions again many people now view this 85 15 ratio as being natural if that as covered in the first night and day analysis when it has been a long time since the last recession many people stop believing in recessions at all and millions of people can this happens every time in the modern era begin taking major financial risks because they have convinced themselves that it will be 100 expansions 0 recessions from here forwards and nighttime will never return the previous 34 sunsets notwithstanding our current issue is that the fed has not yet exited from its last cycle of the containment of crisis and the fed has no historically proven path for hastening the dawn and shortening the recession if there is a 35th sunset and a 35th recession the ammunition just isn t there to create another round of what most people and most financial plans take for granted as being the natural order of things as explored in the prior analysis the fed responds to recessions by slashing interest rates with 100 reliability the graph below builds on that analysis but isolates the interest rate reductions from the top where the fed paused its prior increasing interest rate cycle to the subsequent fed funds rate floor notice that the interest rate reduction bar for the 2007 recession is a different color than the blue bars of the total reductions in interest rates used to exit the previous four recessions the reason for the fire gradient bar is that 2007 was quite different from all the prior reductions this is because the fed only had about 5 25 to work with because of the lower level where fed fund rates were the last time the fed paused and that meant that even slamming interest rates all the way down to the historically unprecedented level of zero percent interest rates wasn t nearly enough by itself to get the united states out of recession the last time around let s look at the historical record for using interest rate reductions to escape recession and particularly concentrate on the three blue bars on the left hand side the interest rate reductions averaged over eight percent if we look at what was needed to jolt the economy out of the recessions of 1980 1981 and 1990 as i ve written about in other analyses while the words monetary policy may sound quite esoteric the historical reality is not subtlety but a series of applications of brute force the great recession of 2007 to 2009 was a particularly nasty recession it was worse than usual because it was the result of the collapse of an asset bubble so what the fed really needed to be able to do was to slam interest rates down by at least the extent that it did in the first three bars on the left side of the graph the downwards blow likely needed to have been a minimum of seven or eight percent if the fed s only historically proven tool for getting the us economy out of recession were to work again by itself but there was a problem the room wasn t there to do that in the previous cycle of crisis and containment of crisis the fed had already smashed fed funds rates down to 50 year lows of below 1 in order to quickly exit the previous recession that was the result of the previous asset bubble collapse with that being tech stock prices the fed never fully recovered from that round of containing crisis from 2001 and still hasn t indeed the fed effectively backed itself into a box in the 2001 to 2006 period and understanding that box has critical implications for understanding the much worse dilemma the fed the economy and the investment markets face today as explored in the analysis linked here by forcing interest rates to 50 year lows the fed created an unnatural spike upwards in asset prices particularly real estate prices the fed then went through a cycle of increasing interest rates but it had to prematurely pause its cycle of increasing interest rates in 2006 during a time of yield curve inversion and growing fears about future economic growth with many similarities to today the problem was that interest rates had started at 50 year lows and even raising fed funds rates to a total of 5 25 before the pause was not nearly enough to get rates to a level of at 7 to 8 where history showed that just slamming down interest rates by itself would be enough to exit recession so trapped in a box of its own making with the lowest interest rates in 50 years having created an asset bubble but without the room to raise rates to the level needed to exit recession when the recession did arrive and it was exacerbated by the popping of the asset bubble the federal reserve had to go to someplace entirely different and resort to extraordinary new unconventional monetary policy measures including quantitative easing i e dropping all pretenses about what modern money really is and creating trillions of dollars in new money out of the nothingness it initially used those dollars to prop up the banking industry and save the global financial system from the bank run then in process the new money was supposed to be very temporary but keeping it and expanding it was too tempting so the fed then took the unprecedented step of buying long term mortgage backed securities in amounts roughly equal to total new mortgage originations at very low interest rates and to thereby help bring the u s economy out of recession by rescuing the housing industry the fed then created still more money to invest in medium and long term treasury bonds while helping to indirectly finance the federal deficits as the government used stimulus spending to try to lift the economy out of recession this also allowed the fed to exert an unprecedented degree of control over medium and long term interest rates forcing them down as well in another form of economic stimulation by going to zero percent interest rates which was unprecedented and using quantitative easing to directly intervene in the economy in a number of other ways which were also unprecedented the nation just barely eventually emerged from recession in the process those extraordinary interventions also changed every aspect of investment prices and returns and financial planning relative to what we ve seen in previous decades that above may sound like a bit of an economy history lesson at this point but it isn t instead that discussion was even more about our collective future to see why let s take another look at our graph as can be seen the fed is in a similar but much worse predicament to where it was before the recession of 2007 interest rates are far lower than they were at that time and the fed has tried to raise them again but it is looking increasingly like that the fed will be pausing in 2019 again as it did in 2006 which was also the last year that the yield curve inverted a current 2 year to 10 year inversion has not yet occurred and might not but we remain very close the fed is likely pausing because of worries that raising rates further will set off asset bubble collapses and trigger another recession which is also the same situation as last time however the current target fed funds rate range is only 2 25 to 2 50 which is a complete outlier relative to the situation coming into previous recessions current interest rate levels are less than half of what they were in 2006 and 2007 and as discussed because those rates were too low to allow an interest rate reduction of sufficient magnitude to exit recession by itself additional measures funded by quantitative easing were needed in order to exit that particularly long and painful recession if we look back to the four interest reductions over the last four decades that were enough by themselves to be successful and jolt the economy out of recession those averaged about 7 8 the distance from current levels to zero percent is only about a third of that amount so even as the warning signals flash that another cycle of recession could occur in the next 1 2 years history shows us that the fed has put itself in a much worse box than it was in the last time around with only about 1 3 of the power needed to exit recession in the way and within the time period that most investors take for granted these days the price of the pause the fed apparently pausing the interest rate cycle is currently very popular with the stock market and the real estate market loves it as well however this pause comes with a potentially very high price if the cycle over the last 164 years is continued and there is a 35th iteration of recession then the fed will be almost helpless when it comes to its only proven historical tool for hastening the beginning of the next and 35th cycle of expansion this could put us back on the left side of the graph with more frequent and more severe recessions and shorter recoveries than what we have seen in the post world war ii era it is also worth carefully studying the graph repeated above and comparing the great recession to the other yellow bars on the left and right side of the graph for the first time since world war ii the fed was unable to entirely rely on its primary tool for shortening recessions when it ran out of room at zero percent interest rates otherwise known as the elb or effective lower boundary relative to the right side of the graph this produced the great recession a somewhat fatter yellow bar that was the worst downturn since the great depression however relative to the left side of the graph the so called great recession was nothing special it fits right into the long string of fatter yellow bars that are the normal historic range when we don t have a fed using its one proven tool for shortening recessions this is critical because many commentators today treat the 19 month great recession of december of 2007 to june of 2009 as being a complete aberration a bizarre outlier that never should have happened in the first place and will never happen again that perspective is simply not factually accurate look at the width of the golden bars on the left side of the graph based upon 164 years of history as studied by the national bureau of economic research an 18 month recession is exactly average recessions of about the length of the great recession are in fact the long term norm unless the fed is actively intervening which it now lacks the room to do in the historically proven manner the other key fact to keep in mind is that over 164 years the average length for each business cycle of expansion and recession was 58 months so if the united states were to actually return to long term averages for recessions and expansions there would be the equivalent of another great recession about once every five years this would also put us right back into being prepared for almost a third of our lives or our retirements being spent in recessions which is the average over the last 164 years unfortunately most financial planning is at least implicitly based upon short and mild recessions about 15 percent of the total time or the total retirement when we look at buy and hold strategies and effectively ignoring the recessions because they are brief and mild relative to the expansions this is assumed as being the natural order of things because it held true during the entire period during which modern portfolio theory and modern financial planning were developed the fed having the room to slam interest rates down and contain recessions purely with the reduction of interest rates is implicitly built into every conventional financial plan even if relatively few retirement investors are aware of this but that room is simply not there anymore the fed was in this box before in 2006 and the results included the great recession and the introduction of quantitative easing creating dollars out of the nothingness by the trillions because the fed saw no alternative with interest rates now far lower but the markets threatening to melt down if there are substantial future interest rate increases the fed remains in the box of its own making that it has been in since 2001 trapped inside cycles of crisis and the containment of crisis but with even fewer conventional or proven options than before for escaping that box seeing the cycles the change in the cycles reading the above some people might jump ahead and think the conclusion is gloom doom and catastrophe as in either we make sunny assumptions about the future or we go straight to the collapse of the financial system the problem with those two popular perspectives is that we have 164 years of history and what those years show us is that both perspectives are dead wrong the sun will almost certainly set again and as covered in the first analysis in this series this happens quickly and with great regularity the average time from the midpoint of each expansion to the onset of each recession is only 20 months the sun will also almost certainly rise again and what history shows us is that the average time between the darkest depths of the middle of each recession and the next sunrise with the onset of the next expansion is about 9 months all else being equal with the fed s primary tool for containing recessions no longer being fully available to it we should expect a return to what history shows us is a more normal business cycle as explored herein it would be a faster cycle averaging a new recession every 58 months instead of every 80 months the recessions would average 18 months each instead of 12 months an increase of 50 with some depressions thrown in as well it would not be the end of the world nor would there need to be a monetary collapse although history shows those happen every now and then as well however the more frequent recessions and longer recessions would combine to mean that the average person should expect to spend about a historically normal third of their life and a third of their retirement in recession instead of the 15 that most people now implicitly take for granted as being the natural order there is an alternative to a return to the historic norm in terms of longer and more frequent recessions and that is that the fed could contain a 35th recession with even more aggressive and unconventional measures that what we have seen to date these interventions that could dwarf what we saw the last time around in terms of quantitative easing and zero interest rate policies this could be true in both in their power and in their impact on prices and returns in almost all investment categories the 35th cycle of recession and the 35th cycle of expansion are each likely to be quite different from what we have seen in past decades so long as the night and day cycles which we have experienced over the last 164 years continue then the future will hold a recession and we know right now that we simply don t have the usual tools to contain and shorten it we lack the tools which we have all come to take for granted in recent decades one alternative then is that next recession could be much deeper or longer than recent recessions it could be more like the long term historic average indeed the great recession which was just an average recession from a long term perspective could have been much deeper or longer if the last round of extraordinary measures those of zero interest policies and quantitative easing had not been used to contain it many people may view this as being pessimistic but this doesn t mean that there won t be another sunrise or another day as we have seen with the previous 34 cycles if there s one thing that history shows us it is that coming sunrise the next expansion is every bit as reliable as the next recession however to get to that place to get to that next expansion the path needs to be different than what we have been seeing since the end of world war ii the last two rounds of the containment of crisis have been very different and they have completely transformed the investment world in the process so as covered in the prior analysis if there s another recession then as a starting point we would likely go straight back to zero percent interest rates which could change everything in the markets we would go straight back to the very abnormal place where very little of our prior investment history from 1946 to 2000 applies but this time that won t be nearly enough in the process it will impact every single investment category as shown in the framework below which i have been using to discuss the investment implications the rows of the changes in the cycles of crisis and the containment of crisis the columns an explanatory analysis for the matrix is linked here the specifics of the next iterations of how night follows day and then day follows night are likely to make the biggest changes to the investment world that we have seen in our lifetimes and yes there are likely to be amplified losses as part of this next 35th cycle of recession particularly when it comes to traditional strategies that essentially assume the 1946 to 2000 era will endlessly repeat itself however we are also likely to see some of the greatest profits in history when it comes to the investment categories that can not only survive but also prosper with the nightfall and then in the next turn of the cycle the amplified profits are likely to move to the generally quite different investment categories that will thrive with the eventual new sunrise and the

by chakravarthi raghavan editor emeritus of south north development monitor suns is based in geneva and has been monitoring and reporting on the wto and its predecessor gatt since 1978 he is author of several books on trade issues and jomo kwame sundaram senior adviser with the khazanah research institute and was an economics professor and united nations assistant secretary general for economic development originally published at inter press service in davos in late january several powerful governments and their allies announced their intention to launch new negotiations on e commerce unusually the intention is to launch the plurilateral negotiations in the world trade organization wto an ostensibly multilateral organization setting problematic precedents for the future of multilateral negotiations any resulting wto agreement especially one to make e commerce tax and tariff free will require amendments to its existing goods agreements the general agreement on trade in services gats and the trade related intellectual property rights trips agreements if it is not an unconditional agreement in the wto it will violate wto most favoured nation mfn principles this will be worse than the old and ostensibly extinct green room processes of a few major powers negotiating among themselves and then imposing their deal on the rest of the membership thus the proposed e commerce rules may be wto illegal unless legitimized by the amendment processes and procedures in article x of the wto treaty any effort to smuggle it into the wto e g by including it in annex iv to the wto treaty plurilateral trade agreements will need after requisite notice a consensus decision at ministerial conference art x 9 of treaty it may still be illegal since the subjects are already covered by agreements in annexes 1a 1b and 1c of the wto treaty consolidating power of the giants powerful technology transnational corporations tncs are trying to rewrite international rules to advance their business interests by gaining access to new foreign markets securing free access to others data accelerating deregulation casualizing labour markets and minimizing tax liabilities while digital technology and trade including electronic or e commerce can accelerate development and create jobs if appropriate policies and arrangements are in place e commerce rhetoric exaggerates opportunities for developing country especially small and medium enterprises instead the negotiations are intended to diminish the right of national authorities to require local presence a prerequisite for the consumer and public to sue a supplier the e commerce proposals are expected to strengthen the dominant tncs enabling them to further dominate digital trade as the reform proposals are likely to strengthen their discretionary powers while limiting public oversight over corporate behaviour in the digital economy developing countries must be vigilant if digital commerce grows without developing countries first increasing value captured from production by improving productive capacities in developing countries closing the digital divide by improving infrastructure and interconnectivity and protecting privacy and data they will have to open their economies even more to foreign imports further digital liberalization without needed investments to improve productive capacities will destroy some jobs casualize others squeeze existing enterprises and limit future development such threats due to accelerated digital liberalization will increase if the fast changing digital economic space is shaped by new regulations influenced by tncs diverting business through e commerce platforms will not only reduce domestic market shares as existing digital trade is currently dominated by a few tncs from the united states and china but also reduce sales tax revenue which governments increasingly rely upon with the earlier shift from direct to indirect taxation developing countries must quickly organize themselves to advance their own agenda for developmental digitization meanwhile concerned civil society organizations and others are proposing new approaches to issues such as data governance anti trust regulation smaller enterprises jobs taxation consumer protection and trade facilitation new approach needed a development focused and jobs enhancing digitization strategy is needed instead effective national policies require sufficient policy space stakeholder participation and regional consultation but the initiative seeks to limit that space developing countries should have the policy space to drive their developmental digitization agendas development partners especially donors should support not drive this agenda developmental digitization will require investment in countries technical legal and economic infrastructure and policies to bridge the digital divide develop domestic digital platforms businesses and capacities to use data in the public interest strategically promote national enterprises e g through national data use frameworks ensure digitization conducive to full employment policies advance the public interest consumer protection healthy competition and sustainable development pro active measures needed following decades of economic liberalization and growing inequality and the increasing clout of digital platforms international institutions should support developmental digitization for national progress rather than digital liberalization developing country governments must be vigilant about such e commerce negotiations and instead undertake pro active measures such as data governance infrastructure developing countries must be vigilant of the dangers of digital colonialism and the digital divide most people do not properly value data while governments too easily allow data transfers to big data corporations without adequate protection for their citizens tnc rights to free data flows should be challenged enterprise competition developing countries still need to promote national enterprises including through pro active policies international rules have enabled wealth transfers from the global south to tncs holding well protected patents national systems of innovation can only succeed if intellectual property monopolies are weakened strengthening property rights enhances tnc powers at the expense of developing country enterprises employment developmental digitization must create decent jobs and livelihoods labour s share of value created has declining in favour of capital which has influenced rule making to its advantage taxation the new e commerce proposals seek to ban not only appropriate taxation but also national presence requirements where they operate to avoid taxes at the expense of competitors paying taxes in compliance with the law tax rules allowing digital tncs to reduce taxable income or shift profits to low tax jurisdictions should be addressed consumer protection strong policies for consumer protection are needed as the proposals would put privacy and data protection at risk besides citizens rights to privacy consumers must have rights to data protection and against tnc and other abuse of human rights competition digital platforms must be better regulated at both national and international level policies are needed to weaken digital economic monopolies and to support citizens consumers and workers in relating to major digital tncs trade facilitation recent trade facilitation in developing countries largely funded by donors has focused on facilitating imports rather than supply side constraints recent support for digital liberalization similarly encourages developing countries to import more instead of developing needed new infrastructure to close digital divides urgent measures needed e commerce has become the new front for further economic liberalization and extension of property rights by removing tariffs on it products liberalizing imports of various services stronger ip protection ending technology transfer requirements and liberalizing government procurement developing countries

by corina pons and maria ramirez el callao venezuela reuters venezuela s most successful financial operations in recent years have not taken place on wall street but in primitive gold mining camps in the nation s southern reaches with the country s economy in meltdown an estimated 300 000 fortune hunters have descended on this mineral rich jungle area to earn a living pulling gold flecked earth from makeshift mines their picks and shovels are helping to prop up the leftist government of president nicolas maduro since 2016 his administration has purchased 17 tonnes of the metal worth around 650 million from so called artisan miners according to the most recent data from the nation s central bank paid with the country s near worthless bank notes these amateurs in turn supply the government with hard currency to purchase badly needed imports of food and hygiene products this gold trade is a blip on international markets still the united states is using sanctions and intimidation in an effort to stop maduro from using his nation s gold to stay afloat the trump administration is pressuring the united kingdom not to release 1 2 billion in gold reserves venezuela has stored in the bank of england u s officials recently castigated an abu dhabi based investment firm for its venezuela gold purchases and have warned other potential foreign buyers to back off the existence of maduro s gold program is well known how it functions is not to get a glimpse inside reuters tracked venezuela s gold from steamy jungle mines through the central bank in the capital of caracas to gold refineries and food exporters abroad speaking with more than 30 people with knowledge of the trade they included miners intermediaries merchants academic researchers diplomats and government officials almost all requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly or because they feared retribution from venezuelan or u s authorities what emerges is the portrait of a desperate experiment in laissez faire industrial policy by venezuela s socialist leaders u s sanctions have hammered the nation s oil industry and crippled its ability to borrow the formal mining sector has been decimated by nationalization so maduro has unleashed freelance prospectors to extract the nation s mineral wealth with virtually no regulation or state investment the bolivarian revolution now leans heavily on ragtag laborers such as jose aular a teenager who says he has contracted malaria five times at a wildcat mine near venezuela s border with brazil aular works 12 hours daily lugging sacks of earth to a small mill that uses toxic mercury to extract flecks of precious metal mining accidents are common in these ramshackle operations workers said so are shootings and robberies the government knows what happens in these mines and it benefits from it said aular 18 our gold goes into their hands maduro has also received a crucial assist from turkish president tayyip erdogan a fellow strongman who has likewise sparred with the trump administration venezuela sells most of its gold to turkish refineries then uses some of the proceeds to buy that nation s consumer goods according to people with direct knowledge of the trade turkish pasta and powdered milk are now staples in maduro s subsidized food program trade between the two nations grew eightfold last year but scrutiny is intensifying as venezuela s politics reach the boiling point in recent days many western countries have recognized venezuela s opposition leader juan guaido as the south american nation s rightful president maduro s adversaries have called on foreign buyers of venezuela s precious metal to stop doing business with what they say is an illegitimate regime we are going to protect our gold opposition legislator carlos paparoni told reuters in an interview gold fever the gold road begins in places like la culebra an isolated jungle area in southern venezuela here hundreds of men labor in crude mining operations that would be at home in the 19th century they excavate mineral laden dirt with picks in hand dug tunnels hauling it out with pulleys and winches their activity is laying waste to fragile forest ecosystems and spreading mosquito borne diseases miners complain of shakedowns by military forces sent to guard the region whose homicide rate is seven times the national average venezuela s ministries of defense and information did not respond to requests for comment miner jose rondon is used to hardship now 47 he arrived in 2016 from northeast venezuela with his two adult sons his bus driver s salary could not keep pace with venezuela s hyperinflation which the international monetary fund projects will hit 10 million percent this year the three men net roughly 10 grams of gold monthly from backbreaking work still it is roughly 20 times what they could earn back home here i do much better said rondon resting in a crude bunkhouse strung with hammocks gold in hand miners head to the town of el callao to sell their nuggets most buyers are unlicensed small scale traders working in cramped shops fitted with alarms and steel doors the state is buying gold everyone is buying gold because it s what is doing well said jhony diaz a licensed wholesaler in puerto ordaz 171 kilometers 106 miles north of el callao diaz says he buys gold from traders and resells every three days to the central bank because venezuela s currency the bolivar is worth less every hour someone holds it the state pays a premium over international prices to make it worthwhile for those who could smuggle gold out of the country to exchange for dollars traders who sell to diaz end up with bricks of cash to carry back to el callao and other gold rush towns to pay miners who use it to buy food supplies and send whatever is left to their families gold purchased by the government is smelted in the nearby furnaces of minerven the state run mining company according to a high ranking employee it is then transported to the vaults of the central bank in the capital caracas 843 kilometers 524 miles away the gold does not stay there long the central bank s gold reserves have plummeted to their lowest levels in 75 years venezuela is selling the artisan metal as well as existing reserves to pay its bills according to two high ranking government officials the main buyer these days is turkey the officials said turkish alliance maduro s gold program has developed in tandem with his deepening relationship with turkey s erdogan both leaders have been criticized internationally for cracking down on political dissent and undermining democratic norms to concentrate power a nov 1 executive order signed by u s president donald trump bars u s persons and entities from buying gold from venezuela it does not apply to foreigners ankara has assured the u s treasury that all of turkey s trade with venezuela is in accordance with international law venezuela in december 2016 announced a direct flight from caracas to istanbul on turkish airlines the development was surprising given low demand for travel between the two nations trade data show those planes are carrying more than passengers on new year s day 2018 venezuela s central bank began shipping gold to turkey with a 36 million air shipment of the metal to istanbul it came just weeks after a visit by maduro to turkey shipments last year reached 900 million according to turkish government data and trade reports venezuela s central bank has been selling its artisan gold directly to turkish refiners according to two senior venezuelan officials proceeds go to the venezuelan state development bank bandes to purchase turkish consumer goods the officials said gold buyers include istanbul gold refinery or igr and sardes kiymetli madenler a turkish trading firm according to a person who works in turkey s gold industry as well as a caracas based diplomat and the two senior venezuelan officials in an interview with reuters igr ceo aysen esen denied the company has been involved in any venezuelan gold deals in a written statement she said she met with venezuelan and turkish officials in istanbul in april to offer her views on compliance with international regulations esen said she advised the turkish government that working with venezuela would not be right for leading institutions or the state as for sardes kiymetli madenler no one at its istanbul offices responded to inquiries from reuters turkish consumer products meanwhile are making their way to venezuelan tables in early december 54 containers of turkish powdered milk arrived at the port of la guaira near caracas according to port records seen by reuters the istanbul based shipper mulberry proje yatirim shares an address with marilyns proje yatirim a mining company that signed a joint venture with venezuela s state mining firm minerven last year according to filings with a turkish trade registry gazette in september the companies did not respond to a request for comment even maduro s critics acknowledge he has pulled off a neat trick of alchemy by compensating hard pressed citizen miners with inflation ravaged bolivars and obtaining precious metal in return he has found a way to spin straw into gold venezuelan economist angel alvarado an opposition lawmaker said dark operations and unusual mechanisms of commercial exchange are among the few tools maduro has left there is a desperation to stay in power at all costs alvarado said reporting by corina pons and maria ramirez in

cryptocurrencies may be facing a prolonged bear market companies that issued tokens or digital currencies over the last two years through initial coin offerings icos may have to sell more of these assets to finance their operations there s just one problem there are very few takers after the blockbuster success of icos in 2017 with funds raised at more than usd 6 billion cryptocurrencies nosedived wiping out about 85 percent of their total market value since hitting a peak of more than usd 800 billion in early 2018 bitcoin the original cryptocurrency has dropped more than 80 percent since hitting an all time high of nearly usd 20 000 in december 2017 a global regulatory crackdown led by the us securities and exchange commission has created fear about greater oversight and acceptance of the currencies for payments among the companies issuing the tokens and the investors that bought them taking the wind out of the once red hot digital assets data from dead coins which tracks crypto startups showed that around 1 000 of these companies either failed in the last year or their projects have now been abandoned for digital currencies still in the market the prospect of incoming supply some with a predetermined schedule could pose a challenge to their businesses given the current downturn in the market many people don t fully understand the impact of new supply on this market particularly when there s low liquidity said ryan selkis co founder of messari a crypto data platform in new york i don t think anyone has any idea how much hidden inflation there is in the form of token reserves that are going to be unwound gradually data from messari showed that 71 coins of the more than 400 tokens on its database have issued less than 50 percent of their targeted total supply which means there is a flood of these assets that could be sold to the market or distributed in some shape or form zcash a more than two year old digital currency with strong privacy features has 28 05 percent of its total supply issued so far according to messari data that means its token holders could see the supply mushroom more than three fold in the years ahead which would pressure coin values unless outweighed by demand the supply pressure is not just coming from companies that need to sell tokens to finance their operations but also from early investors in icos who were given investment contracts that give them the right to future tokens the terms of those contracts are at the discretion of the company raising the funds or the issuer of the token those tokens have liquidity provisions that allow investors to sell them but have found it difficult to do so because the coins are now under water analysts said i think a lot of these tokens have been issued on the assumption of a very bullish crypto market on all fronts said kyle r chapman a partner at boston based cosimo ventures a private equity and venture capital firm focused on early stage technology companies although a cap on the total number of any one token was designed as a measure to help preserve value that has not prevented a supply glut as demand has plunged the total number of bitcoins that could ever be created for instance is around 21 million of which around 17 5 million or 83 percent have already been minted by contrast the governments and central banks that control so called fiat currencies like the us dollar can issue more at will diminishing their value over time some digital currency issuers have tried to minimise the impact of price declines by undertaking measures to reduce token supply with varying degrees of success less than a year after crypto inheritance startup digipulse sold its token to the public in october 2017 the company moved to detokenise its business by accepting fiat currencies with the aim of eliminating speculation on its currency the company eventually shut down by accepting fiat money as payment these companies effectively abandon their ico investors and render their virtual unit less valuable said consulting firm ernst and young in a report on icos released last october other companies have resorted to burning their own tokens and removing them from circulation similar to share buybacks by cutting the number of tokens companies hope to make the currencies that remain in circulation rarer and more valuable in token burning miners and developers typically purchase coins from investors and then send them to specialised addresses that have unobtainable private keys without access to a private key no one can use these tokens putting them outside the circulating supply companies like tron a decentralised application platform and binance a cryptocurrency exchange have burned their tokens the problem with token burning however is that companies need funds to buy back the tokens from investors before they can burn them said cosimo s chapman but many of these startups do not have the cash to burn their tokens because of the decline in the value of their own coins it has become a vicious cycle analysts said companies need their investors to use their tokens to grow their platform and network but their currencies have become pure speculative investments however by removing their tokens from circulation the startups limit the growth of their products which rely on the use of these digital assets their business model is predicated on increasing the value of their protocol tokens said josh stein chief executive officer at harbor inc in san francisco which runs a platform that helps converts securities into tokens backed by assets such as real estate the big beatdown in valuations is a big threat to their business models he said
you are getting a much more sober assessment of global growth says mohamed el erian chief economic adviser at allianz what has gone wrong the sea change reflects in part a realisation that policymakers became overly bullish last year says mr el erian the fed in particular over reached by signalling four increases in interest rates for 2018 when the global economy was still fragile he says its newfound caution is providing air cover for other central banks to mark down their own rate expectations the key turning point came in the fourth quarter when markets suddenly began to wake up to a host of political hazards including the danger of a further worsening in trade relations between the us and china that tightening in financial conditions was enough to shave 0 4 per cent from growth in us output after six months says isabelle mateos y lago a strategist at the blackrock investment institute since then between a third and a quarter of that tightening has been reversed as equities rebounded but central banks still had no choice but to respond she says it makes sense to lift the foot off the brake the us domestic economy has continued to put in a robust performance with the number of new jobs in january coming in well ahead of wall street expectations and wage growth running comfortably above inflation but corporate giants in the s p 500 index which generate over a third of their earnings overseas are sounding the alarm about faltering overseas demand in markets including china where the government has been battling against a slowdown jerome powell presided over a quarter point increase in rates on december 19 but his attempts to couple that rise with reassuring messaging about future moves fell flat al drago smaller us firms are feeling the global chill as well rob parmentier president of marquis yachts which employs 350 people in green bay wisconsin says that while domestic demand is firm the tit for tat imposition of tariffs has clobbered his international business it is not getting bad it is dead he says bluntly advertisement the addition of a 25 per cent tariff on us boat exports to europe has been punishing he adds it is twofold not only the tariffs but europe has never really come back from their recession the fed which led the world s major central banks in beginning to tighten in 2015 has been at the centre of the recent outbreak of dovishness mr powell presided over a quarter point increase in rates on december 19 but his attempts to couple that rise with reassuring messaging about future moves fell flat the danger sign came when equities were sold off after the chairman repeated well worn language insisting the reduction of the central bank s balance sheet will run on automatic pilot philip lowe warned of an accumulation of downside risks including trade skirmishes between china and the us rising populism and brexit dan himbrechts wall street s dyspeptic reaction to his words underscored to policymakers just how fragile market sentiment had become business confidence has since been dented by the record long federal government shutdown while brexit discussions have floundered moreover hopes of progress in trade talks with china have sunk as mr trump has ruled out a direct meeting with chinese president xi jinping before his march 1 deadline for a deal advertisement with us inflation as tepid as ever the fed has set aside recent worries about economic overheating focusing instead on what central bankers like to call downside risks rate rises are for the time being off the agenda indeed if the current ceasefire over trade is reversed analysts will start asking about rate reductions in the us were trade talks between the us and china to break down altogether accompanied by full blown hostilities with europe over auto trade america could be pushed into an outright recession according to deutsche bank its analysts further flag the risks of a sharper chinese slowdown and a no deal brexit the mood of unease at the fed is being mirrored elsewhere australia s reserve bank shifted to a more cautious outlook last week amid concerns that steep falls in house prices and the slowdown in china could choke off domestic growth donald trump described the us as the hottest economy anywhere not even close but the us is prone to self inflicted economic wounds andrew harnik ap unemployment in australia fell to 5 per cent in december its lowest rate since 2011 but there are growing concerns that a weakening housing market is hitting household consumption with retail sales unexpectedly falling by 0 4 per cent in december compared with the previous month evidence of the deteriorating housing market is on show every weekend in sydney and melbourne where once bustling saturday housing auctions now struggle to attract even a handful of buyers just four in every 10 homes put up for sale in december were sold in the traditional roadside auctions prices in australia s two biggest cities have fallen 12 per cent and 9 per cent respectively from peaks achieved in 2017 shane oliver amp economist predicts that prices could fall by as much as 25 per cent from their peak levels stephen king an economic adviser to hsbc sees good reason for central bankers to be treading carefully of 37 countries he recently examined only eight have reduced their aggregate debt ratios compared with the beginning of the financial crisis this means central banks will naturally be more cautious in raising rates he argues if you thought the crisis was associated with debt in some senses we are in a more vulnerable state now advertisement some of the biggest questions hang over europe the european commission on thursday slashed its growth forecast for this year to 1 3 per cent from 1 9 per cent marking down outlooks for major economies including germany it is now predicting the weakest expansion in italy for five years the european central bank has sounded the alarm about the impact of trade tensions and brexit only weeks after it stopped expanding its 2 6 trillion 4 2 trillion quantitative easing program but ms mateos y lago at blackrock says she fears the political barriers to restarting that particular stimulus plan are too high for the ecb to hurdle warning we are worried the eurozone is not very well equipped to meet a significant slowdown in the economy one of the ironies behind the changing mood among central bankers is that the most prominent u turn has occurred in what is arguably the most resilient looking major economy the us bill dunkelberg the chief economist at the national federation of independent business dismisses sombre talk saying the biggest immediate concern for firms is a shortage of labour everyone is getting into a tizzy it looks like everyone is getting into a tizzy over whether europe is going to slow down or india or china he says that will have some impact for the us but i think we are getting carried away here mr trump who described the us as the hottest economy anywhere not even close in his state of the union speech would no doubt agree some analysts wonder whether having become overly hawkish last year the fed has now overcorrected the us is relatively less exposed to trade which in the past has allowed it to avoid importing nasty foreign crises to its own shores but as the federal shutdown showed earlier this year it is also a country that is prone to self inflicted economic wounds potentially destabilising battles loom in congress over the need to raise the ceiling on the us national debt meanwhile the clock is ticking on mr trump s trade truce with china having been badly burnt by the market sell off late last year mr powell is determined to play things safer in 2019 by putting the tightening cycle on hold for a swelling band of central banks in other parts of the world there is ample reason to follow suit financial times

capacity factor was 94 6 exceeding 94 for the third year in a row in five out of the last six years we generated the most nuclear power ever at 159 million megawatt hours avoiding more than 82 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emission in 2018 our average outage duration was 21 days a new exelon record and 13 days better than the industry average exelon power s gas and hydro dispatch match 98 1 and wind and solar capture 96 1 were better than plan in october we acquired the everett lng import facility and in december we received a cost of service order from ferc on mystic units 8 and 9 which together will allow us to provide fuel security in new england market through may of 2024 our mystic units were critical in keeping the lights on during the extreme cold temperatures we saw in january and february of last year at constellation our c i operating metrics remain strong 78 customer renewal rates average customer duration of more than six years and power contract terms of 24 months on average we continue to see stable unit margins with our power customers and continued focus on cost is helping us support operating margins constellation s strength lies in its durable relationship with its customers that relationship is more than just power and gas but is built on constellation s unique ability to help our customers meet their energy needs while also reaching their environmental and sustainability goals now i ll turn it over to joe joseph nigro senior executive vice president chief financial officer thank you chris and good morning everyone today i will cover our 2018 results annual updates to our financial disclosures and 2019 guidance starting with slide number eight we had another strong year for the fourth quarter we earned 0 16 per share on a gaap basis and 0 58 per share on a non gaap basis for the full year we earned 3 12 per share on a non gaap basis which is at the midpoint of our revised full year guidance of 3 05 to 3 20 per share and 0 07 above our original midpoint exelon utilities outperformed our full year plan due to higher distribution and transmission revenues with the early resolution of rate cases at pepco and favorable weather this was partially offset by the first quarter winter storms exgen performed in line with guidance realized gains at our nuclear decommissioning trust funds were offset by several factors unique to 2018 including higher allocated transmission costs overall we delivered well in our financial commitments turning to slide nine it shows an overview of our 2018 rate case outcomes across our utilities we received final orders in eight distribution cases we reached settlements in six of the cases at peco delmarva delaware on the electric and gas sides delmarva maryland and pepco maryland in dc which is the first time we ve had settlements at pepco since the 1980s additionally comed received 100 of its ask for the second year in a row and finally in early january the maryland psc approved 78 of the ask in bge s gas distribution case our focus on improving the reliability and service levels is reflected in our rate case outcomes across our jurisdictions on slide 10 we compare the 2018 trailing 12 month blended transmission and distribution earned roes to 2017 our constructive rate case results and the roll off of the fas 109 charge drove the improved earns earned returns this year we are encouraged by phi s ongoing improvement with earned roes improving by 70 basis points to 140 basis points exelon utilities earned a combined 9 7 roe up year over year we remain focused on achieving our utility earnings growth targets by improving the earned roes at phi and sustaining strong performance at our other utilities we expect that all our utilities will earn in a 9 to 10 range in 2019 on slide 11 we roll forward our outlook for utility capex and rate base growth covering 2019 to 2022 since the merger with phi in 2016 we have invested more than 16 billion in our utilities and plan to invest nearly 23 billion over the next four years as chris said these investments are improving our system reliability service experienced by our utility customers and preparing us for the future as a reminder the capex budgets we share with you reflect identified and approved projects as we move through time we generally find more investment due to additional system needs when we compare our 2019 to 2021 capex outlook versus the same period last year we plan to invest an additional 1 5 billion of capex for the benefit of our customers this additional capital is spread across our utilities with the biggest increase at our largest utility comed since the phi merger we have added nearly 6 billion in rate base across the utilities over the next four years we will grow our rate base 7 8 annually to 50 7 billion adding 13 1 billion to rate base by 2022 or the equivalent of adding a utility almost the size of comed without paying a premium issuing equity or obtaining merger approvals rate base is growing slightly faster than the 7 4 growth we projected last year as a reminder the bulk of our rate base growth is covered under either formula rates or mechanisms like capital trackers these support our ability to make additional investments to strengthen our system and have the opportunity to earn a fair and timely return on our capital where we do not have these mechanisms we will continue to work with stakeholders to establish more timely recovery tools in the appendix we provide a more detailed breakdown of the capital and rate base outlook for each utility starting on slide 22 as you turn to slide 12 we continue to forecast strong utility less holding company eps growth of 6 to 8 even for the elevated even from the elevated 2018 starting point where we executed the midpoint of our guidance range we exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by 0 09 per share compared to last year the outlook for 2019 to 2021 has improved with all bands increasing by 0 05 per share the durability of our industry leading earnings growth reflects a combination of strong rate base growth to support system needs for a more digital economy and growing environmental goals along with concerted efforts to manage costs and are focused on modest customer bill in place ph on slide 13 we provide our gross margin update and current hedging strategy at the generation company there is no change in total gross margin in 2019 from our last disclosure open gross margin increased 50 million due to improving spark spreads at ercot as well as higher prices at new york zone a and nihub which were offset by our hedges during the quarter we executed 50 million in power new business in 2020 open gross margin is up 150 million due to higher prices in most of our regions given our hedged positions and execution of 100 million of new business total gross margin increased by 50 million since last quarter we are showing you 2021 for the first time today which is down 250 million compared to 2020 the decline reflects lower power prices in pjm and ercot plus lower capacity revenues in new england and pjm our power and non power new business to go numbers for 2021 are consistent with prior years i should point out that these disclosures are based on 12 31 pricing and do not reflect any impacts from recently approved ordc curve changes in texas we ve remained behind our ratable hedging program in all years we ended the year 9 to 12 behind ratable in 2019 and 8 to 11 behind ratable in 2020 while we re 0 02 to 0 05 2 to 5 behind ratable in 2021 when considering cross commodity hedges our open market length is primarily concentrated in the midwest and texas we are comfortable maintaining a more open position given our balance sheet slide 14 shows our o m and capital outlook at generation our o m forecast has been updated since our third quarter call primarily to reflect the increased pension expense and the acquisition of the everett marine terminal that serves our mystic units like others the returns on our pension investments did not meet our planned returns resulting in increased costs going forward in total these updates have added 75 million in o m costs or about a 6 0 06 per share drag in 2019 through 2021 however we even with these cost pressures we expect to see a 1 annual decline in o m over the next four years compared to our previous disclosure our 2019 to 2021 capex is up modestly in 2019 due to timing delays for our medway plant and some retail customer site at solos ph in 2020 with modest increases in nuclear fuel costs related to the rising uranium prices where we have hedged with collars we continue to look for ways to be more efficient in how we work and spend while maintaining the safety and reliability of the fleet slide 15 rolls forward exchange available cash flow outlook for 2019 through 2022 we expect cumulative available cash flow to be 7 8 billion which is 200 million higher than our previous four year outlook we will use the available cash flow from exgen to primarily fund the increased utility investment pay down debt and cover a small portion of the dividends we will invest approximately 600 million in growth capital which is primarily customer cited solar projects at constellation and as i mentioned the completion of the west medway plant in new england this quarter as i mentioned earlier we have identified additional capital investment at our utilities as a result we have significantly increased the amount of equity going into the utilities from exgen by 700 million to a range of 4 billion to 4 4 billion we will use between 300 million and 500 million of exgen s free cash flow to fund the dividend not covered by the utilities as the utilities continue to grow exgen s portion of the dividend decreases even as the dividend itself grows finally we ve planned to retire between 2 2 billion and 2 8 billion of debt with our strong credit metrics exceeding our internal targets we felt it made more sense to shift cash planned for debt reduction to instead support the higher value adding and needed investments at our utilities a big part of our value proposition is our unique ability to redeploy strong free cash flow from generation to fund utility growth without needing to go to the equity market this remains a differentiated advantage to our peers moving on to slide 16 we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our investment grade credit ratings we are comfortably ahead of our corporate targets for ffo to debt and well above the agency s downgrade threshold as you are aware exelon and its operating companies are on creditwatch positive at both s p and fitch looking at exgen we are well ahead of our debt to ebitda target of 3 times in 2019 we expect to be at 2 4 times debt to ebitda and 1 9 times debt to ebitda on a recourse basis we are actively following the pge bankruptcy process pge is the sole offtaker of our antelope valley solar ranch or avsr facility which was funded by exelon s doe loans and project financing that are non recourse to exelon we along with other owners of renewable generation under contract with pg e recently received a ferc order affirming the commission s role to approve any modifications to existing ppas which pg e has challenged in the bankruptcy court we will remain diligent in protecting the contractual value of avsr and the role what assets like ours have in california s clean energy future from an earnings perspective avsr provides 0 03 per share to exelon in operating earnings and is not significant to our credit metrics given the non recourse financials finally i will conclude with our 2019 earnings guidance on slide 17 we are providing 2019 adjusted operating earnings guidance of 3 to 3 30 per share growth in earnings at the utilities is driven by the continued increase in rate base as we deploy capital for the benefit of our consumers last year s completed rate cases and improvements in phi s roes the decline in generation earnings is a combination of normalized illinois zec revenues as we recognized 0 11 of 2017 illinois zec revenues in the first quarter of 2018 and lower realized energy prices which are partially offset by increased zec revenues in new jersey and new york as well as fewer planned nuclear outages as you think about our 2019 earnings the most notable new updates include the 0 05 per share increase to our utility earnings bands the 0 02 to 0 03 of pension expense at exgen due to worse than expected plan performance in 2018 as well as a roughly 0 03 per share drag from the recent everett lng facility acquisition which represents a negative near term impact but is a positive value driver in future with the mystic cost of service contract beginning in 2022 these impacts are reflected in our o m and other expense data in the appendix we expect first quarter operating earnings to be in a range of 0 80 to 0 90 per share more detail on the year over year drivers by operating company can be found in the appendix starting on slide 61 i will now turn the call back to chris for his closing comments christopher m crane president chief executive officer director thanks joe turning to slide 18 i want to discuss our key focus areas for 2019 we will continue to deliver operational excellence across our businesses focusing on modernizing the grid and improving the customer experience at our utilities and running our generation fleet safely and reliably we will meet or exceed our financial commitments including achieving earnings within our guidance range and maintaining our investment grade rating at the utilities we will prudently and effectively deploy 5 3 billion of capital to benefit our customers and we will file rate cases with the goal of achieving the 9 to 10 earned roes across exelon utility families by year end building upon successes in delaware dc maryland and pennsylvania we will advocate for policies in our state legislatures and our commissions that will enable the utility of the future and help meet the needs of our customers at generation a number of our nuclear plants are economically challenged due to market flaws that fail to value zero carbon nuclear energy for its environmental and grid resiliency benefits as you know we plan to retire tmi later this year and as a reminder all of the dresden and portions of the braidwood and byron plants did not clear last year s pjm auction we will continue to engage with stakeholders on stay policies while advocating broader market reforms at the federal level we will support pjm price formation changes like fast start and reserve market reforms with our states to implement the expected ferc order on pjm capacity reforms and preserve the authority of our states to advance their clean energy policies and continue our efforts to seek fair compensation for zero emitting nuclear plants we ll continue to grow our dividend at 5 annually through 2020 and we ll be a partner and ally in the communities we serve being a good corporate citizen for our customers communities and employees is key to who we are finally turning to slide 19 i will close on the value proposition that highlights our strategy and our commitment to shareholders we have updated some of the numbers but the proposal proposition remains the same we ll continue to focus on growing our utilities targeting a 7 8 growth rate base growth and a 6 to 8 earnings growth through 2022 rolling forward another year at above the group trajectory we ll continue to use free cash flow from exgen to fund incremental equity needs of the utilities pay down debt and fund part of the growing dividend we will continue to optimize value of our genco business by seeking fair compensation for our zero emitting generation fleet selling assets where it makes sense to accelerate debt reduction plans and maximizing value through the gen to load match strategy at constellation we will sustain strong investment grade metrics and we ll grow the dividend annually at 5 through 2020 the strategy underpins this value proposition is effective and providing tangible benefits for our stakeholders we are well positioned for growth to capture additional upside though needed policy and market reforms are required we are very confident about the prospects for exelon in 2019 and beyond and we remain committed to optimizing the value of our business and earn your ongoing support at exelon with that operator we can now open the call up to questions thank you questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions our first question this morning comes from greg gordon from evercore isi please go ahead greg gordon evercore isi analyst thanks good morning christopher m crane president chief executive officer director hey greg greg gordon evercore isi analyst on the utility side of the business obviously a pretty meaningful increase in capital opportunities across the entire set of companies what s the expected bill impact of the increase in spending and as you look at the long term and how much more sort of customer experience enhancing types of capital programs are you contemplating that are also affordable as we think about the opportunity not just this year to execute on this new capital plan but to continue to evolve your plan anne r pramaggiore senior executive vice president chief executive officer of exelon utilities good morning greg it s anne pramaggiore i ll start with your first question we when put our capital plans together our inaudible we look at what the needs are in front of us we challenge ourselves on o m and if you can look at the o m trajectory it s about 0 3 increase over that four year period and we always look at affordability and we ve got eight bills on the distribution rate side and four of them excuse me three of them are roughly flat over that period that we ve showed you four of them are trending less than inflation and one of them will come in right at inflation and that s a combination of managing our o m and also our energy efficiency programs which are becoming a bigger and bigger part of our package here so that s basically what we re looking at in terms of affordability the other question that we ask ourselves is are there vulnerable groups inside that average that we look at in terms of billing and rates and we so we ve been looking hard at the low income side and a lot of our initiatives include enhanced low income programs along with it so that s what we re looking at in terms of affordability bills that are staying at or well below inflation and also looking at low income in terms of looking forward we think about investment in really three buckets one is reliability and resiliency just the core basics and improving the material condition of our systems the safety of our systems and as the economy changes and we ve got more and more parts of the economy leaning on the electric system how do you ensure that reliable and resilient the second area is really adapting to renewables and distributed generation we ve got a lot of flexibility and dynamism to add to the grid in order to be able to deal with the kinds of changes that we ll see in terms of supply coming from many different places and many different actors and demand being much more volatile so thinking about sensors on the system artificial intelligence distributed intelligence on the system that allow us to move operations on our assets from 16 to 18 cycles down to six to eight cycles that sort of thing and then the last area is really thinking about electrification of transportation and what we need to do to the system to in expectation of that kind of shift so those are the areas that we think about and look at we watch our stakeholders very closely we re starting to see legislation and policy come out of dc in december big piece of policy there pennsylvania came out with a clean energy and greenhouse gas reduction executive order in january and so we watch what our stakeholders and our policymakers are telling us and how they re directing us greg gordon evercore isi analyst thanks i ll ask one more and then go to the back of the queue joe i know that we re focused on the strong 18 performance in the 19 outlook but i think it s sort of deja vu all over again with people just focused on the 2021 rollout sort of the guidance pieces for exgen and once again we see as we have in prior years pretty significant backwardation and what the current state of play is for the earnings outlook for exgen based on the algebra you gave in the deck it s 0 20 headwind on total gross margin probably 0 05 to offset through to o m but still much like we ve seen in past updates that are sort of two years forward but it looks like today significant pressures on exgen margin what can you tell investors about how you feel about that as you think we roll into real time over the next two years joseph nigro senior executive vice president chief financial officer greg i appreciate the question the first thing is we re not in the business of giving eps guidance beyond the prompt year but having said that i think as you ve seen through time our earnings have improved each year when you look at forward years and by the time we get to those in the realized time period when you look at the gross margin in 21 versus 20 there s a the two big drivers very simply are as you mentioned one is the backward dated price curve and obviously for us the biggest impact is that nihub and west hub and jim could talk for a while about what we re doing we are aggressively managing our portfolio you see that we re behind our ratable plan actual spot prices last year obviously we re very very strong and then secondly kathleen and her team are working very aggressively on policy reforms as well as pjm and others and so i don t think the story has been fully written there and obviously we have a very large open position the second piece of it is it s driven really by capacity and some of it s on in new england where the prices were lower year over year and in pjm where we had lower volumes clear year over year but from my lens i think the strength of our balance sheet affords us strategic and operational flexibility and hedging is less hedging is an example of that and through time we ve continued to improve our earnings and we ll continue to work hard to do that in 21 christopher m crane president chief executive officer director so greg gordon evercore isi analyst okay thank you guys christopher m crane president chief executive officer director just to add on i mean just to summarize that you ve got low minimal liquidity in those years those 21 out 20 and 21 and out you build the liquidity as you go through the prompt year into the next year and you see the curves come up and that s been the pattern until we get these market reforms in if it s moving the plants in illinois or some amount of plants in illinois to frr so we can get better capacity treatment that matches the states environmental needs or if you look at price formation that s working through you look at reserve curves being revised there s a lot of activity going so that s why we re keeping more of an open position we believe the market will strengthen thank you chris thanks operator our next question comes from steve fleishman from wolfe research please go ahead steve fleishman wolfe research analyst hi good morning christopher m crane president chief executive officer director hi steve fleishman wolfe research analyst couple of market structure questions hi chris the and first of all in pennsylvania in terms of any chance to get a zec could you give us an update there and when would something have to happen for you to not have to close tmi christopher m crane president chief executive officer director so the activities that kathleen is leading with the other operating companies in pennsylvania are promising we have some strong support the it s going to have to move this spring we have to order a core by may and we ve let the stakeholders know that so if we can get this through in that period of time we will be able to save the unit short of that we ll be beyond a return at the end of may steve fleishman wolfe research analyst and is there any sense on what the value targeted value of the zec is going to be in pennsylvania kathleen l barron senior executive vice president of governmental and regulatory affairs public policy i ll take that one steve this is kathleen i think that is subject to discussions that are ongoing among the lawmakers now so we don t have an estimate for you on how the program will look how it will be priced those are all discussions that are progressing as chris said with some promising outlook steve fleishman wolfe research analyst okay and then just and then just have to ask and probably hard to answer just any better sense of where ferc may come out on the capacity market reforms is there any hints of the changes at ferc and what happened with the new england auction and things like that where you might have a better idea kathleen l barron senior executive vice president of governmental and regulatory affairs public policy i ll take that one as well i don t think we have a better idea than we did on our last call of how they re going to come out clearly there has been some delay in the schedule and i think that s a function of the transition effort the unfortunate death of the chairman integrating a new commissioner commissioner inaudible announcing her plans for retirement so while they have been able to get out a number of important orders others have lagged and the capacity market order is among them so i think as we re doing as you re doing looking at the tea leaves and trying to make an estimate of where we think things will land but we really have no signal yet from then from them as to when we ll see their final decision in that docket steve fleishman wolfe research analyst okay great thank you christopher m crane president chief executive officer director thanks operator our next question comes from julien dumoulin smith from bank of america please go ahead julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst hi good morning can you hear me christopher m crane president chief executive officer director yeah hear you well good morning julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst excellent congratulations again wanted to follow up a little bit more on the utility side can you walk through some of the more specific dynamics for the longer date the 2022 ph year i mean that s just a pretty impressive jump at the end there what exact dynamics and also what kind of earned roes are you embedding out there within the ranges i mean just perhaps once you get to 22 what are we going to be talking about with respect to the position of the utilities and also rate case schedule et cetera anne r pramaggiore senior executive vice president chief executive officer of exelon utilities hi julien it s anne pramaggiore let me start by giving you a sense of what the investment patterns look like and what s sort of i think driving the trending that you re seeing and then between joe and i will talk about the roes so we are there s a couple of things that are happening there one of the one of the things that we ve done in the last year so we ve gone through an accelerated our gas main replacement program so we ve moved them from 30 years to 20 years and so you re seeing an acceleration of the gas investment so that s one of the pieces that you re seeing trending there one of the things that we re doing at peco now is we re looking at some material condition upgrades but we re also doing a program to upgrade for 4 kv feeders to 12 kv feeders in anticipation of more and more distributed generation coming on the system you just can t put that stuff on the kind of some of the some of the feeders we ve got in place right now so that s one of the areas we re looking at another program at peco is really enhancing the underground replacement program again our underground cable program again some material condition work i think you are pretty familiar with the most of the phi work we ve got dc plug that we re getting started and we also are looking at some work potentially coming through off of the new legislation that was passed in december at bg e we ve got some new ev investment that s coming through after the order that just came out of that commission so some additional capital investment there at comed we re expanding the distribution automation program that we have in place we re doing some more underground cable work and starting to invest across the utilities on security investments we ve got about a program for security on our substations and cybersecurity that s about 900 million across the utilities over that period and some investment in some of our it systems to get ready for again more flexible dynamic grids so those are i think some of the things that you re looking at that s driving that capital trend joseph nigro senior executive vice president chief financial officer and julian i would julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst and just to jump on quickly in there what s driving that uptick from 2021 to 2022 though like what are the dynamics there specifically that s a pretty big jump joseph nigro senior executive vice president chief financial officer so julien it s joe good morning specifically to your question the jump from 2021 to 2022 anne went through each of the utilities the investment that we re making into the rate base that compounding of that investment is one component of it the second thing is we have a rate case in peco in 21 that has benefits in 22 and then the third thing is there s additional spending under the formula rate at comed so those three things together get you to that outcome julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst excellent and then turning back to the other side of the business real quickly can you talk a little bit about everett and the contribution on the exgen side as you see that their cost of service kick in in 22 and then also how do you think about that asset align to even if mystic were ultimately to be pulled out of the market how do you think about the lng asset itself contributing kind of more structurally then joseph nigro senior executive vice president chief financial officer yeah i think first of all julien we acquired the marine terminal in q4 as i mentioned in my prepared remarks the acquisition is earnings negative from 2019 to 21 driven by the increased o m amounts with about half of the 75 million increase in o m or 0 03 a share being driven by everett the gross margin in from the facility is included in our open gross margin calculation in our hedge disclosure and isn t really material what i would say is obviously the mystic cost of service contract arrangement begins in 2022 and it effectively the whole thing is bundled and it becomes accretive at that time we committed we had a capacity commitment prior to the last auction and we were committed to honoring that commitment and one way to do that was to acquire the facility we were also very clear to your question about how would we treat it in the future we re very clear that with any type of asset that isn t economically viable we re going to work for solutions and we d just try to make that asset viable but i think you ve seen with our financial discipline that when we ve had to we ve taken the stance of making the necessary change julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst excellent thank you very much all congrats again christopher m crane president chief executive officer director thanks operator our next question comes from michael weinstein from credit suisse please go ahead michael weinstein credit suisse analyst hi guys thanks for taking my question christopher m crane president chief executive officer director hi michael michael weinstein credit suisse analyst hey just to be clear on the roes at phi you re saying that for all of 2019 you ll be at the 9 to 10 range or are you going to be or is that like a run rate at the end of the year joseph nigro senior executive vice president chief financial officer that that will be by the end of the year we will be in that range of 9 to 10 and effectively that will be the trailing 12 month at that time michael weinstein credit suisse analyst got you okay and then on the ordc i understand it s a dynamic issue and you re not going to provide a point number on it but is one of the things we ve tried to estimate it ourselves here around 25 million perhaps of improvements for exelon just wondering if that s in the right ballpark of if you can give some kind of kind of hint as to where what kind of impact you see you re thinking this might have on you james mchugh chief executive officer of constellation and executive vice president of exelon right and to be clear hi it s jim mchugh michael to be clear we re talking about ercot michael weinstein credit suisse analyst yes james mchugh chief executive officer of constellation and executive vice president of exelon okay ercot ordc it is hard to put a pin point number on it the way we re looking at it right now is even before the ordc change we ve been talking about the tighter reserve margins and you ve seen the cdr reports and we re in agreement with where they re coming in now that the the reserve margins for this upcoming summer look like there are somewhere between 7 and 8 so i think with the ordc changes you re just making the likelihood that scarcity is going to play a bigger role and where the summer prices go we ve seen the forward market move up since the end of q3 about 15 for summer on peak over the last month or so it s been more up and down and maybe a little higher but more flattish so i think the market has been moving around its expectation of just how many scarcity hours there is going to be which to your point is the hard thing to predict it obviously depends on when whether you have coincidental high loads with generation outages or variable wind ph the one way to think about it perhaps is a single hour at 9 000 is 1 on the kelly ph atc price it s about 13 or 14 on the summer on peak price so i think what we re going to see the market do is really trade in a pretty volatile range as the assessment of how many scarcity hours there may or may not be can drive that summer 15 at a time just by adding an hour or two so to put an estimate on right now is really to say how many hours we think there s going to be but i think the way we like to think about it is increase the likelihood and send the right price signal in times of tight market conditions christopher m crane president chief executive officer director and michael jim is keeping a relatively significant open position and capability to extract value as we see volatility occur both in the forwards for the summer in 19 as well as we ll position ourselves well during that summer period michael weinstein credit suisse analyst thank you very much for the help operator our next question comes from shar pourreza from guggenheim partners please go ahead shar pourreza guggenheim securities analyst hey joe and chris christopher m crane president chief executive officer director hey shar shar pourreza guggenheim securities analyst so just real quick on the o m profile change post 22 should we kind of assume this is the new normal and then as we re sort of thinking about some of the incremental revenue items that s not within plan that could help mitigate or at least support some of this o m pressures especially as you are closer to 2021 can you provide some color there i mean i think you mentioned mystic is obviously one of it and lng is another one is there sort of anything else we should be thinking about from the revenue offset side joseph nigro senior executive vice president chief financial officer yeah the one thing i would say and obviously we haven t given you a forecast of o m 22 and beyond but the one thing i would say and i made the comment in my prepared remarks the debt cost of service agreement at mystic kicks in the middle of 2022 and that would more than that would more than offset those cost of the o m that we show you in 21 so effectively we ve turned into an accretive outcome as i said in my prepared remarks christopher m crane president chief executive officer director and the pension as you know the market for 2018 was not great on equities december was pretty tough we bought we got some of that portion of that back in january so we ll watch the pension we ll watch the pension investments the interest rate and the return on the fund is what will drive the other half of what we saw the increase on this year so everett and the pension as far as our o m discipline we work through the out years we are far less than 1 all across the company and that s dealing with labor contracts at 2 5 wage increases and other inflation forces so we do have a good plan on continuing to drive efficiency hold cost down and maintain that inflation rate it s much lower at the generating company than utilities but still the utilities are less than 1 shar pourreza guggenheim securities analyst okay got it and then just lastly chris that s helpful and then as we are sort of thinking about the exgen gross margin i know we ve talked about in the past maybe taking somewhat of a different approach when it comes to managing the portfolio i e maybe operating some of the units more from a portfolio approach right so like maybe fitzpatrick or nine mile right are we sort of seeing any impact from this in your outlook or is this sort of something you guys are still going through internally and then i guess what i m asking is also beyond fitzpatrick and nine mile is there any sort of things we should be thinking about from taking a more holistic approach to the assets james mchugh chief executive officer of constellation and executive vice president of exelon yeah hi it s jim i mean if you re talking about new york i think the way we re thinking about the portfolio in new york is the capacity the zec payment that we receive in new york has somewhat of an offsetting nature as energy prices rise so we re out in the outer years so we re looking to make sure we hedge our portfolio along the lines of where we think that index is going to set as the zec as the zec price sets according to the structure the index structure in the zec so really there is not much of a shift in our strategy i think what we ve been doing is finding opportunities in the nearby year or two on the energy side to understand if we think the market is slightly under priced or slightly overpriced and right now recently we ve seen a pretty strong move in new york prices and we ve been getting some good hedges off in inaudible area to take advantage of those higher new york energy prices shar pourreza guggenheim securities analyst well i guess what i m asking is have you seen any synergies for having these two assets so close to each other more from less from a dispatch and hedging but more from taking these systems taking the units and operating them as one so like there s clearly there are some synergies in there for owning these two assets so close to each other right christopher m crane president chief executive officer director yeah i didn t get your question at first so i m sorry shar pourreza guggenheim securities analyst yeah no that s ok christopher m crane president chief executive officer director so the nuclear team is evaluating that what they can do as far as management what they can do as far as warehousing we have looked at combining security plans that s a cost prohibitive item but they re continuing to drive through that there is definitely more synergies that we will be continuing to work on there as we complete the integration and the team has time to work through the regulatory process and the have time to make the investments to make these consolidations shar pourreza guggenheim securities analyst perfect and those synergies are incremental to plan christopher m crane president chief executive officer director right they will be if the ones that aren t included now but there are also our initiatives that are under way across the nuclear fleet we re looking at how we centralize warehouses versus having over stock warehouses each site there s a lot of initiatives under way right now to take advantage as technology advances and built into the cost savings number now is an assumption that we centralize engineering since we have much more digital information and we can trend the equipment remotely versus having the engineers in the plant on the site so there s things like that across the fleet that we re working on shar pourreza guggenheim securities analyst perfect chris that s what i was trying to get at thanks so much christopher m crane president chief executive officer director thanks operator our next question comes from jonathan arnold from deutsche bank please go ahead jonathan arnold from deutsche bank please go ahead christopher m crane president chief executive officer director hey jon jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst just a couple of things on the o m at exgen just when you look behind the numbers that obviously you have these new incremental pieces are you still going after the 200 million in additional cost savings christopher m crane president chief executive officer director yeah jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst it was inaudible services that you shared at eei christopher m crane president chief executive officer director yeah that s still in the plan we have line of sight on that we will continue and just to reemphasize we re not going off plan on savings or efficiency two factors pension underperformance in the market required us to higher state o m in everett which reverses out and provides greater revenues in the 2022 time frame so these are these are the things we have line of sight of it s not that the efficiency programs have been taking the pedal off of them jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst yes i just wanted to check chris because you re showing it slightly differently so thank you for that christopher m crane president chief executive officer director okay we ll get with you to clarify that jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst and secondly i see you ve removed the disclosures on new england sensitivities and we realize this the mystic contracts out in 2022 but just is that just smallness and to make it simpler or something else going on there joseph nigro senior executive vice president chief financial officer no there s really nothing else going on jon so we made a decision to collapse the new england region into open gross margin because with the changes to that facility and the inputs of gas and so on and the associated contract change the volume of our power generation output is falling and then you ve got the gas acquisition of everett that we ve talked about and that would all factor into that everett calculation and you would see changes that were quite variable quarter to quarter most importantly the overall gross margin is very small compared to the total gross margin we provide you in the disclosure jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst okay thank you and then could i don t know if this is timely or not but chris any update on sort of efforts to engage the legislature in illinois coalition building et cetera i know we did notice the bill that seem to be very renewables only got flouted this week so i was just curious if you have any comments you d like to share on that christopher m crane president chief executive officer director yes it s very very early in the legislative cycle as you can imagine we work within the coalitions within the state on what s needed to continue to advance the environmental stakeholders the customers and sound investments so we have our folks communicating in those coalitions and communicating with the legislative folks premature to say what it looks like at the end of the day but they re at the beginning of the sausage making right now and we ll continue to have productive conversations jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst is the ferc order sort of a prerequisite for actually something happening this year christopher m crane president chief executive officer director not on the not on the utility side and we are looking at other methods on the generation side the ferc order definitely would be helpful to get out in a timely manner but we don t need it you can go to use the current statute and achieve what we think we can do want to do jonathan arnold deutsche bank analyst okay i ll leave at that thank you chris christopher m crane president chief executive officer director thanks operator our final question comes from praful mehta from citigroup please go ahead praful mehta citigroup analyst thanks so much hi guys christopher m crane president chief executive officer director hey praful how are you praful mehta citigroup analyst great thanks for this marathon session so quickly on pjm i guess one last piece that was left for fast start so just wanted to get any color or view on timing of when that will come we ve been waiting for it for a while at this point kathleen l barron senior executive vice president of governmental and regulatory affairs public policy yeah this is kathleen and i think that s within the scope of what i said earlier on the call unfortunately there are a number of matters that are lagging and that s one of them and i think the transitions at the commission have affected their ability to get big orders out but just going back to the beginning of the fast start docket recall this is something that the ferc ask pjm to file so we continue to feel confident about how it will turn out even if it s going to take a little bit longer than we expected praful mehta citigroup analyst got you fair enough and then slide 15 that s very helpful capital allocation slide that you provide in that if we think about all of these benefits that are potentially coming on the exgen side right with fast start ordc zecs all of them are incremental to the plan how would we think about the allocation given you ve kind of hit your utility investment targets you re hitting your debt reduction targets where does the incremental capital that potentially comes through go in your mind going forward joseph nigro senior executive vice president chief financial officer the answer in my mind i think is very similar to what you saw with the plan with the increase at the utilities anne talked about the way she s thinking about the three buckets of investment at our utilities and the benefits to our customers as it relates to those three buckets we would continue to look at ways as we see projects that are beneficial for that we would continue to look at investment there and then i think additionally that increment those incremental dollars continue to provide us operating and strategic flexibility and we ve talked about what that s worth in the sense of our hedging and the opportunity to be more aggressive with that and other things so we re going to continue to work hard to get those and i think it gives us a lot of opportunity praful mehta citigroup analyst got you but share buyback is not one of those that s in the plan right now or contemplated in the plan christopher m crane president chief executive officer director no it s not contemplated in the plan but all investments are bounced ph off a share buyback before they re made praful mehta citigroup analyst got you perfect well i appreciate it guys thank you so much christopher m crane president chief executive officer director well i want to thank everybody all of you for participating today i want to thank you our employees for another good year both operationally and financially so with that we ll close out the call and all have a good weekend operator this does conclude today s

bitcoin the original cryptocurrency has dropped more than 80 percent since hitting an all time high of nearly usd 20 000 71 coins of the more than 400 tokens on its database have issued less than 50 percent of their targeted total supply cryptocurrencies may be facing a prolonged bear market companies that issued tokens or digital currencies over the last two years through initial coin offerings icos may have to sell more of these assets to finance their operations thereâ s just one problem there are very few takers after the blockbuster success of icos in 2017 with funds raised at more than usd 6 billion cryptocurrencies nosedived wiping out about 85 percent of their total market value since hitting a peak of more than usd 800 billion in early 2018 bitcoin the original cryptocurrency has dropped more than 80 percent since hitting an all time high of nearly usd 20 000 in december 2017 a global regulatory crackdown led by the us securities and exchange commission has created fear about greater oversight and acceptance of the currencies for payments among the companies issuing the tokens and the investors that bought them taking the wind out of the once red hot digital assets data from dead coins which tracks crypto startups showed that around 1 000 of these companies either failed in the last year or their projects have now been abandoned for digital currencies still in the market the prospect of incoming supply some with a predetermined schedule could pose a challenge to their businesses given the current downturn in the market â many people donâ t fully understand the impact of new supply on this market particularly when thereâ s low liquidity â said ryan selkis co founder of messari a crypto data platform in new york â i donâ t think anyone has any idea how much hidden inflation there is in the form of token reserves that are going to be unwound gradually â data from messari showed that 71 coins of the more than 400 tokens on its database have issued less than 50 percent of their targeted total supply which means there is a flood of these assets that could be sold to the market or distributed in some shape or form zcash a more than two year old digital currency with strong privacy features has 28 05 percent of its total supply issued so far according to messari data that means its token holders could see the supply mushroom more than three fold in the years ahead which would pressure coin values unless outweighed by demand the supply pressure is not just coming from companies that need to sell tokens to finance their operations but also from early investors in icos who were given investment contracts that give them the right to future tokens the terms of those contracts are at the discretion of the company raising the funds or the issuer of the token those tokens have liquidity provisions that allow investors to sell them but have found it difficult to do so because the coins are now under water analysts said â i think a lot of these tokens have been issued on the assumption of a very bullish crypto market on all fronts â said kyle r chapman a partner at boston based cosimo ventures a private equity and venture capital firm focused on early stage technology companies although a cap on the total number of any one token was designed as a measure to help preserve value that has not prevented a supply glut as demand has plunged the total number of bitcoins that could ever be created for instance is around 21 million of which around 17 5 million or 83 percent have already been minted by contrast the governments and central banks that control so called fiat currencies like the us dollar can issue more at will diminishing their value over time some digital currency issuers have tried to minimise the impact of price declines by undertaking measures to reduce token supply with varying degrees of success less than a year after crypto inheritance startup digipulse sold its token to the public in october 2017 the company moved to detokenise its business by accepting fiat currencies with the aim of eliminating speculation on its currency the company eventually shut down by accepting fiat money as payment these companies effectively abandon their ico investors and render their virtual unit less valuable said consulting firm ernst and young in a report on icos released last october other companies have resorted to burning their own tokens and removing them from circulation similar to share buybacks by cutting the number of tokens companies hope to make the currencies that remain in circulation rarer and more valuable in token burning miners and developers typically purchase coins from investors and then send them to specialised addresses that have unobtainable private keys without access to a private key no one can use these tokens putting them outside the circulating supply companies like tron a decentralised application platform and binance a cryptocurrency exchange have burned their tokens the problem with token burning however is that companies need funds to buy back the tokens from investors before they can burn them said cosimoâ s chapman but many of these startups do not have the cash to burn their tokens because of the decline in the value of their own coins it has become a vicious cycle analysts said companies need their investors to use their tokens to grow their platform and network but their currencies have become pure speculative investments however by removing their tokens from circulation the startups limit the growth of their products which rely on the use of these digital assets â their business model is predicated on increasing the value of their protocol tokens â said josh stein chief executive officer at harbor inc in san francisco which runs a platform that helps converts securities into tokens backed by assets such as real estate â the big beatdown in valuations is a big threat to their business models â he said
advertisement sen sherrod brown rumpled wrinkled happy warrior is he ready to run ohio senator says he can beat trump without compromising progressive bona fides share copy link copy if sen sherrod brown of ohio gets into the 2020 presidential race he won t be the flashiest or smoothest candidate that s just fine with him last year the lifelong progressive democrat aired a television ad for his successful re election bid that featured local media descriptions of him as rumpled disheveled and wrinkled my wife is sort of bemused by it brown said in an interview saturday evening she says when he leaves the house he looks ok brown 66 has shown up at political events in his home state in a cleveland indians hoodie or a denim shirt despite the everyman look he s an experienced politician he s not a household name in new hampshire but he s a familiar figure on capitol hill where he s been working for more than a quarter of a century elected to the ohio house of representatives in 1974 at the age of 22 brown is also a former secretary of state of his home state winning the post at age 30 he was elected to the u s house in 1992 and served seven terms before being elected to the u s senate in 2006 he won a third term last year now although he gives every indication that he s close to becoming a presidential candidate he said he is truly undecided and will not decide or announce his plans until march brown was in new hampshire on friday night and saturday on what he s calling a dignity of work listening tour taking notes at roundtable discussions with local advocates and activists as they did most of the talking he was in iowa the state with the first caucus last weekend and will soon head to the two other early voting states south carolina and nevada his stops in new hampshire included discussions about paid family leave and other issues important to working people in hampton berlin laconia and concord on saturday night brown keynoted the new hampshire young democrats annual granite slate awards event in manchester as he prepared to wrap up his visit brown sat down with wmur he said granite staters told him of their concerns about health care particularly the cost of prescription drugs the fairness of the tax system and what he described as the added pressure on day care facilities to take care of small kids who have seen their parents overdose die or be addicted did his visit nudge him closer to a candidacy i m not being coy i just don t know yet he said this is not something that i ever thought i d do this is still new enough to me but don t mistake deliberativeness for a lack of interest or anything short of me being all in if i run what are the odds that he ll run it really is pretty much 50 50 he said brown has been a consistently successful democrat in a state which according to the ohio voter project has 1 9 million republican 1 3 million democratic and 4 5 million unaffiliated voters last year he was the only democrat to win a statewide election in ohio a state president donald trump won two years earlier by 8 percentage points if i run and i m the nominee i d be in a good position to beat trump because no republican has ever been elected without carrying ohio and only twice has the winner in ohio not won the presidency brown said medicare at 50 55brown is known as one of the most progressive members of the senate but he s not ready to embrace some of the currently popular initiatives making their way through progressive circles and the democratic presidential field while several announced and potential candidates are embracing medicare for all brown supported a measure to allow people 55 years old and older to buy into medicare and he has recently lowered his preferred age threshold to 50 years old i want to get something done and help people brown said if the house were to pass medicare at 50 or 55 it would put a lot of pressure on republican senate majority leader mitch mcconnell i think it would become one of the first things a democratic president would do if we set the stage and i know we could pass it i want to help people now he said i ve met too many 58 year olds and 62 year olds who sold their businesses and they want to retire and they want insurance or they lost their jobs or their plant closed so really to me it s get something done something really big and a lot of people will take advantage of it and then it leads to universal coverage tax plansmassachusetts sen elizabeth warren who announced her candidacy for president saturday has a plan to impose a billionaire surtax on the super rich the wealthy should surely pay their fair share and they re not brown said but let s do something bigger than that he cited three bills he has worked on in recent years he said he discussed two of them with trump before the president laid out his tax plan but neither idea was included in the plan the patriot corporation act says that if you pay your workers a decent wage and you pay decent benefits and you do your production in the united states you get a lower tax rate brown said he has also proposed a corporate freeloader fee if you are a big company and you pay your executives millions of dollars but you pay your workers low wages and as a result they are eligible for medicaid section 8 housing vouchers the earned income tax credit and food stamps then you basically reimburse taxpayers for all the subsidies they give to your employees he has also proposed the gain act which would double the earned income tax credit for households with children and expand the credit more substantially for workers who do not have children living at home those three together call it bold call it whatever brown said they d be significant it would have huge impact because you put more money into the pockets of the middle class and working families and you provide more opportunity for low income people and you provide more revenue warren promised saturday to refuse donations from lobbyists and corporate political action committees and reject the support of super pacs she challenged the other candidates to join her brown said that if he runs he will refuse corporate political action committee donations brown vs greedy lenders as part of his message of populism brown has said that he has taken on big banks and wall street but his critics point out that he has received millions of dollars in political contributions from the finance insurance and real estate sectors brown responded there is nobody in the senate who has consistently as long as i have taken on financial interests taken on the banks and the greedy lenders on wall street he acknowledged that the contributions are not insignificant but he said look at my record and look at what i ve fought for and nobody can say that i compromised my principles or didn t hold the big banks accountable year after year after year after year brown opposed the north american free trade agreement and in general agreement with some of trump s tariffs the problem has been that the chinese have half the steel making capacity half the world s aluminum smelting capacity and other examples of that and that will continue to grow he said and it will work its way up the supply chain of the united states if we don t do something so we have to do something tariffs are a temporary tool not a permanent trade policy but trump has treated tariffs as if they are a permanent trade policy brown opposed trump s imposition of high tariffs on friendly nations when we should be allying with them to focus on the serial cheaters and the serial cheaters are china south korea and turkey mostly china i agree with his positions of using tariffs i agree with pulling out of the trans pacific partnership but not the way he did it calls trump racistbrown called trump a racist on national television last week and he stood by it saturday saying trump reminds me of it every day he called on virginia gov ralph northam a fellow democrat to resign after northam admitted to appearing in a racist yearbook photo showing one person dressed in blackface and another in a ku klux klan white hood and robe brown however said he has not thought enough about northam to say whether he believes that northam is a racist progressive bona fides a monmouth university poll earlier this week showed that most likely democratic primary voters across the country are willing to overlook their disagreements with a candidate on particular issues if that candidate has what it takes to beat trump democrats have often screwed up by being purists brown said but at the same time he rejected being labeled as an incrementalist i ll be the only democrat on the stage if i run who voted against the iraq war and vote against the defense of marriage act so my progressive bona fides are unquestioned he said my style is different my demeanor is a little less confrontational perhaps i m more of an optimist if i run i ll run as the happy warrior more than the angry something or other and i m not saying that about anybody in particular but i ve shown i can win republican votes and win in a republican state and beat republicans and fundamentally i d say what gives me an advantage in a general election without making too much of it or making it personal is that unlike most of them i ve actually beaten republicans consistently in a state that trump won by a lot

during the height of the bakken oil boom in north dakota rod jaques and sue mink were living in sweet home oregon when they hit a low point they had just had their power disabled and jaques had a mere 10 in his wallet we had nothing said jaques i prayed and prayed and prayed but then something happened jaques saw a documentary on cnn about the explosive growth in williston north dakota and days later the husband and wife team decided to take a chance they sold all of their belongings and hopped in a truck bound for williston where they would later start a business setting up mobile offices and manufactured homes selling what few assets they had was risky but the gamble paid off the couple won t tell you how much they made they ll just tell you they did well flash forward to today and the couple is now reinvesting their money into flipping homes in butte they made a 50 000 profit on the first home they sold and all together they ve purchased seven properties in the mining city since moving here six years ago they ll tell you that flipping homes is fun especially the decorating part but the houses that they purchase are anything but glamorous at least not at first they re what you would call fixer uppers busted up rough around the edges cinderella homes that cost them as little as 11 000 and no more than 35 000 what the couple does next is transformative they take the disheveled properties and turn them into hip updated homes with new plumbing wiring sewer lines and all the fixings that are still affordable for a first time homebuyer listing them for no more than 190 000 of the homes they ve purchased two have sold in just two days as mink and jaques will tell you it s a seller s market currently in butte and it s an opinion shared by many real estate professionals in the mining city at first glance butte s real estate market may not seem like anything to shake a stick at when compared to markets in bozeman missoula and billings its gains have been modest marked by slow steady growth at best but for those who have been in butte for a long time slow and steady wins the race especially in light of some of the toughest times in butte s history are investors starting to take note of butte with tattooed arms and a cool understated demeanor ben cannon is doing real estate with style cannon 39 is the owner of two 20 property management in butte and he said more and more over the years he s found himself helping his clients find new properties for their investments finally one day he decided to get his sales license and join harrison avenue realty because as he said instead of sitting on the sidelines as agents collected commissions on sales he helped generate he would much rather be collecting the commissions himself cannon hasn t just stopped at getting his real estate license in july he ended up purchasing harrison avenue realty from then owner sarah smith today he continues to operate his property management company while specializing in connecting investors with real estate through his new gig myself personally i wanted to focus on investment properties he said adding that other harrison avenue agents have their own niches as well we re able to service any client he said not wanting to leave that part out cannon said he feels there has been increasing interest from investors in butte in recent years most notably as a result of butte s affordability there s been much to do about housing affordability in the big sky state s most metropolitan communities places like the city of bozeman where from december 2017 through december 2018 the median sales price for a home was 427 500 according to figures from the big sky country multiple listing service in silver bow county that figure was just 152 000 making butte a bargain cannon said for investors who are getting priced out of other communities bozeman isn t the only community grappling with housing affordability which begs the question is butte poised to benefit from investors and refugees from other communities who are no longer able to afford a single family home some real estate agents in butte think so including cannon who said he s been working with a number of out of town investors looking to purchase properties in western montana some as far away as utah arizona and colorado people have realized that the housing market in butte has been considerably cheaper than the surrounding areas namely helena bozeman and missoula so their investment dollars go a little bit further here than they would anywhere else said cannon what investors say jaques and mink the couple now flipping homes after nearly going broke years ago say butte s affordable housing is what attracted them to the mining city in the first place the couple had just begun to grow tired of their lifestyle in the bakken when they heard that a house across the street from where mink s aunt lives in butte was going for just 25 000 i told my wife there ain t no way said jaques nobody sells a house for 25 000 but we checked and it was for 25 000 said jaques so we paid cash for it moved here and refurbished it and now we love this place we love butte the two say their first investment property was at first just a pleasant detour from their usual business of setting up mobile offices and manufactured homes they purchased the harvard avenue property for 15 000 as a way to make a little extra income during the slow months of winter and retain their employees who were apt to look for work elsewhere when things were slow jaques and his wife hoped to break even after all there was a 6 foot hole in the property and it hadn t been occupied since the 1980s but much to their surprise they ended up making a 50 000 profit i thought oh my goodness there s money in this said jaques the success of that first home led the couple to take on more projects they have bought seven properties in butte including their own and have since turned over their first business to their son and are now flipping homes fulltime through their company mink restoration mink and jaques say they believe that what they do in butte wouldn t be possible in montana s top markets the price has to be right butte s the only place we know we can go in and buy a house for anywhere from 15 000 to 35 000 said mink but that doesn t mean that flipping homes in butte s low end market is easy mink noted that to do what they do takes some know how about which properties to buy they don t buy every cheap property they come across she said because some have too much debt on them while others are beyond repair and it takes some investment too for the current iowa avenue home they re working on jaques said he and his wife will make an approximate investment of 105 000 including the purchase price they plan to sell it for 190 000 and although mink and jaques didn t say it it s clear from the work that they do that there s an extra it factor involved between the two mink takes the lead on the interior decoration front jaques describes her as an artist she has a knack for creative ideas and a modern taste that s likely to appeal to young families plus there s also the hard work and attention to detail the couple puts into the homes they buy and they say they take pride in their craftsmanship denver based developers danielle and jeff zimmerman also have a knack for flipping defunct properties it s something that danielle says she enjoys finding diamonds in the rough and turning them into gems the zimmermans in their early 30s primarily work in the highly competitive and expensive denver market in 2017 they expanded their horizons by purchasing the o rourke building at the corner of quartz and alaska streets in uptown butte starting in the summer renovations have been ongoing at the historic building where the couple plans to turn the building s 23 units into upscale apartments the o rourke is actually two buildings that sit next to each other the first built in 1892 and the second in 1908 the building has had a number of owners over the years and has fallen into disrepair but its original opulence is still apparent replete with bay windows grand staircases and unique architectural details a summer tour of the building showed a structure that was nearly down to its studs danielle said earlier this month that the upgrades needed for the property make the cost of investment nearly comparable to what it would take to embark on similar a project with an updated property in denver but for zimmerman the o rourke is a labor of love one that s well worth the investment she says what brought her and her husband to the mining city was butte s authenticity and its historic architecture it s a place that has captured their hearts and imaginations and they want to be part of the town s revitalization story since purchasing the o rourke the zimmermans have taken another historic property under their wing the circa 1902 kenwood building at 63 w broadway st the building is in better shape than the o rourke its previous owner pioneer technical services renovated the building earning the company the montana preservation alliance historic preservation excellence award in 1999 the zimmermans plan to rent 19 above ground offices and two storefronts on the bottom floor of the four story 20 000 square foot building on the top floor they ve established a co working space in a spacious open lounge that clients can rent for a monthly fee they also plan to install a beer tap where members can drink craft brews for free they re super popular in bigger cities zimmerman said of the co working concept adding that she and jeff hope to create a space where people can collaborate and ideas can thrive this she hopes will support entrepreneurs and foster creativity that hopefully can result in the creation of new businesses do si do according to some local agents another reason why butte may be seeing increased investor activity could have to do with a recent reorganization among butte real estate firms starting around the end of 2017 several real estate firms in butte left the local multiple listing service and joined the big sky country multiple listing service a few also joined the gallatin county association of realtors firms interviewed by the standard who joined big sky said they feel the transition has put more eyes on butte properties and has brought more investors to the mining city as a result by expanding and broadening our mls with big sky country the bozeman folks are able to look into and finally see our listings and our price and our affordability said matt stout who owns homestead real estate so we really couldn t give you a hardcore number of how many investors are coming from out of town but there s just a strong feeling that we have sold because those folks see how affordable we are if anything it s helped our local market said craig dessing also a broker and owner at homestead real estate i ve noticed a lot more investors coming over here since we opened it up mike mcleod who owns mcleod realtors spoke to the standard during the summer i think it s brought buyers to our area that may not have been here before i think that s a positive thing said mcleod denise kelly from remax premier expressed similar sentiments we re seeing more and more investors coming from bozeman because they can still buy something that s affordable she said transplants investors aren t the only people poised to benefit from butte s affordable housing market there are also first time homebuyers in addition to seeing increased interest from investors bill markovich of coldwell banker markovich real estate said in a written statement that his firm has sold to a surprising number of clients who want to work in helena or bozeman but feel they can live in butte and make the drive to their job more easily than pay the cost of housing in those communities when asked whether butte has the potential to benefit from housing affordability issues in other communities mcleod responded in the affirmative absolutely one of the things about butte that i think that we ve all known who have lived here is if you truly enjoy montana there s no better place to be as far as getting to the outdoors whether it s skiing fishing or hunting or biking and these young couples at least the ones that i ve dealt with are active they like all the things about the outdoors and when you compare our home prices to anywhere from bozeman to missoula we re just that much more competitive said mcleod christine martin isn t an expert on real estate but she s an aspiring homeowner who came to butte five years ago to escape what she called outrageous rent prices in missoula i was tired of getting priced out the butte resident said adding that her new zip code has made homeownership seem a lot more attainable martin said moving to butte has not only made owning a home a more realistic goal for her and her boyfriend but it has also helped her career martin is an artist and she said the job market for creatives is oversaturated in her former haunt of missoula today she s the curator and building director at the historic clark chateau and leads print making workshops at the imagine butte resource center in the months ahead she s planning to exhibit a major project at several locations in southwest montana including in the mining city where she said the community has welcomed her with open arms martin can list several individuals whose stories are like her own mostly people from butte s art community this she said is something that makes her confident about butte s future when asked if she felt like a cowboy by moving to butte martin laughed and said she doesn t think of herself as a pioneer noting that butte was cool long before she got here shari curtis adult services librarian at the butte silver bow public library is a survivor of the bozeman housing market after a stint out of state the bozeman native returned to her hometown only to find that housing wasn t affordable the population has more than doubled curtis said housing prices are just outrageous curtis said she couldn t get a job in bozeman but was able to land the librarian gig at the butte library she moved to the mining city for the job a transition that she said enabled her to purchase her dream home a five bedroom home she couldn t even dream of affording in bozeman butte real estate market looking healthier but can affordability really attract a significant number of people to the mining city butte s population has been relatively stagnant in recent years marked by slow steady growth starting at a low point of around 33 400 in 2005 and creeping slowly from around 34 200 in 2010 to 34 600 in 2017 according to u s census estimates some real estate agents in town say more jobs are needed for butte to go to the next level nonetheless agents who spoke with the standard say the real estate market is looking healthy especially if one takes the long view jennifer and gary shea of century 21 shea realty say butte has come a long way from the closure of the mines in the 1980s and the touch america debacle of 2003 which left many wondering if the bottom was about to fall out again gary got his real estate license in 1999 when the real estate landscape was much different in 1999 if you talked to anyone about finding real estate in uptown butte they would have looked at you like you re nuts said gary it was not he said a time people were thinking about investing in real estate or development bonnie hawke managing broker at berkshire hathaway homeservices told a similar story when she bought her first house when she was 19 years old there were many foreclosed homes that had federal loans issued on them on the market but sometime around the mid 2000s things started to change according to shea the population stopped declining while local leaders made a push for a more diverse economy meanwhile northwestern energy s decision to stay in butte was also a confidence booster today the market looks healthy and stable the sheas said we re in an affordable market for investors we re in an affordable market for first time homebuyers anaconda s the same way said jennifer now investors are thinking butte is one of the better places to invest in because the future is looking brighter and the prices are much better than in other markets gary said meanwhile butte has proven to be a so called sellers market in recent years we think the market in butte is very healthy particularly the single family home residential market said gary almost everyone who spoke with the standard said the most popular properties currently are homes below approximately 180 000 a few said new construction has been popular while others noted an uptick in interest in high end homes costing around 300 000 and up kelly described the market as stable adding that last year s average sales price of 173 507 in silver bow county was up 20 percent from the previous year however she said sales have slowed a bit due to the government shutdown s impact on federal loans for homebuyers markovich said that the real estate market in 2018 was strong until the third quarter at which time it started to weaken slightly but added there is still a high demand for quality well priced properties reps from mcleod and homestead real estate said low inventory levels are driving the market at the moment the demand has outpaced the supply there s just no doubt about it said mcleod as far as houses our inventory is pretty low said stout reflecting on numbers from the summer i think we ve had upwards of 200 and 300 listings at times in butte and now we re at a hundred and some kelly had similar sentiments we ve been short on inventory for a long time she said we have more buyers than we have inventory low inventory levels part of national trend but butte where incidentally a majority of the housing stock was built prior to 1939 at around 38 percent according to the u s census bureau isn t unique in its housing inventory issues communities across the u s are running low on homes experts in the field cite a number of potential drivers that could be causing the low inventory levels ranging from homeowners holding on to their real estate to government regulations and skittishness among developers resulting from the 2008 housing crisis all in all there doesn t appear to be a consensus as to exactly why demand is outpacing housing inventory levels gary shea meanwhile partly attributes the trend to workforce shortages in the construction sector he noted that in butte in particular new home construction has fallen behind when compared to that in other montana communities that s not to say there hasn t been new construction another of markovich s business markovich construction inc has been at the forefront of recent projects in butte including the construction of 94 new multifamily units in the area east of continental drive some of those will be units for the copper ridge apartments a new affordable housing complex that will be co owned and operated by butte affordable housing a nonprofit related to the public housing authority of butte the others will be part of an expansion near the meadowlands senior living complex located at continental drive and elizabeth warren similarly the same developers behind the clarion inn copper king hotel convention center matt nistler and brothers ben and rex leipheimer broke ground west of the hotel this spring on 42 new apartment units that they plan to market toward seniors markovich said butte could see more new housing develop projects announced in 2019 adding we are seeing a large number of custom homes being built which is a trend that started in 2018 and which we expect to continue seeing in 2019 predictions for 2019 real estate professionals who spoke with the standard say they think the local market will continue to stay firm and the mining city will continue to see the same trends play out in 2019 we are projecting a steady but slight rise in demand for listings said markovich adding that rising interest rates new jobs coming into our community and our traditional position in butte of not being influenced as much by the highs and lows in the national economy will help housing stay a strong sector of our economy i believe we re going to continue to see a healthy market i think we ll probably see a better inventory though and i think interest rates might go up a little bit but i think they are still going to be great interest rates said jennifer shea kelly also thinks the trend will continue i think people are pretty confident with real estate in butte and it s still affordable for first time homebuyers as for mcleod he thinks butte has potential in the long term we all know that butte has a certain stigma slash perception to the rest of the world to some people not everyone but i think it s the most wonderful place to live and the more people who come here and experience it through our festivals through just coming for a weekend it s all going to be a positive thing
new york new york russia got some good news on friday as moody s announced it was upgrading the country s sovereign debt ratings russia s government of issuer and unsecured senior debt ratings has been lifted from ba1 to baa3 and its other short term rating to prime 3 p 3 from not prime np in addition the rating agency s outlook on its issuer rating has been changed to stable from positive the upgrade of russia s ratings reflects the positive impact of policies enacted in recent years to strengthen russia s already robust public finance and external metrics and reduce the country s vulnerability to external shocks including fresh sanctions the stable outlook reflects evenly balanced upside and downside credit risks moody s said in a statement published on friday in a related decision moody s has raised russia s country ceilings on foreign currency debt to baa2 p 2 from baa3 p 3 its country ceilings on foreign currency bank deposits to baa3 p 3 from ba2 np and its country ceilings for local currency debt and deposits to baa1 from baa2 generally speaking each of these ceilings indicates the highest possible ratings level that can be assigned to the relevant liabilities the moody s statement said moody s noted russia s vulnerability to external shocks low oil prices and interrnational sanctions more of which it is anticipating however in moody s view the government s capacity to withstand external shocks including further sanctions has improved since the sovereign rating was downgraded to ba1 in 2015 the ongoing reduction in external vulnerability is reflected in the sovereign s still strong balance sheet and increasingly robust external position both of which moody s expects to be sustained these strengths are attributable in large part to the authorities policy response to the terms of trade and sanctions shocks that have negatively impacted the economy since 2014 more recently the adoption of pension reforms shifts labor force trends in a positive direction and will support fiscal strength over the longer term the ratings agency statement said russia s external finances are more robust than a year ago and in some respects stronger than in 2014 when the external shocks initially struck the country the central bank s foreign exchange reserves cover 80 of external debt including direct investment compared to 57 of external debt in june 2014 even though capital outflows including net external debt payments rose last year they were more than covered by the current account surplus which widened to 115 billion or 7 of gdp significantly strengthened by higher oil prices and a strong performance from non oil exports
cryptocurrencies may be facing a prolonged bear market companies that issued tokens or digital currencies over the last two years through initial coin offerings icos may have to sell more of these assets to finance their operations there s just one problem there are very few takers after the blockbuster success of icos in 2017 with funds raised at more than usd 6 billion cryptocurrencies nosedived wiping out about 85 percent of their total market value since hitting a peak of more than usd 800 billion in early 2018 bitcoin the original cryptocurrency has dropped more than 80 percent since hitting an all time high of nearly usd 20 000 in december 2017 a global regulatory crackdown led by the us securities and exchange commission has created fear about greater oversight and acceptance of the currencies for payments among the companies issuing the tokens and the investors that bought them taking the wind out of the once red hot digital assets data from dead coins which tracks crypto startups showed that around 1 000 of these companies either failed in the last year or their projects have now been abandoned for digital currencies still in the market the prospect of incoming supply some with a predetermined schedule could pose a challenge to their businesses given the current downturn in the market many people don t fully understand the impact of new supply on this market particularly when there s low liquidity said ryan selkis co founder of messari a crypto data platform in new york i don t think anyone has any idea how much hidden inflation there is in the form of token reserves that are going to be unwound gradually data from messari showed that 71 coins of the more than 400 tokens on its database have issued less than 50 percent of their targeted total supply which means there is a flood of these assets that could be sold to the market or distributed in some shape or form zcash a more than two year old digital currency with strong privacy features has 28 05 percent of its total supply issued so far according to messari data that means its token holders could see the supply mushroom more than three fold in the years ahead which would pressure coin values unless outweighed by demand the supply pressure is not just coming from companies that need to sell tokens to finance their operations but also from early investors in icos who were given investment contracts that give them the right to future tokens the terms of those contracts are at the discretion of the company raising the funds or the issuer of the token those tokens have liquidity provisions that allow investors to sell them but have found it difficult to do so because the coins are now under water analysts said i think a lot of these tokens have been issued on the assumption of a very bullish crypto market on all fronts said kyle r chapman a partner at boston based cosimo ventures a private equity and venture capital firm focused on early stage technology companies although a cap on the total number of any one token was designed as a measure to help preserve value that has not prevented a supply glut as demand has plunged the total number of bitcoins that could ever be created for instance is around 21 million of which around 17 5 million or 83 percent have already been minted by contrast the governments and central banks that control so called fiat currencies like the us dollar can issue more at will diminishing their value over time some digital currency issuers have tried to minimise the impact of price declines by undertaking measures to reduce token supply with varying degrees of success less than a year after crypto inheritance startup digipulse sold its token to the public in october 2017 the company moved to detokenise its business by accepting fiat currencies with the aim of eliminating speculation on its currency the company eventually shut down by accepting fiat money as payment these companies effectively abandon their ico investors and render their virtual unit less valuable said consulting firm ernst and young in a report on icos released last october other companies have resorted to burning their own tokens and removing them from circulation similar to share buybacks by cutting the number of tokens companies hope to make the currencies that remain in circulation rarer and more valuable in token burning miners and developers typically purchase coins from investors and then send them to specialised addresses that have unobtainable private keys without access to a private key no one can use these tokens putting them outside the circulating supply companies like tron a decentralised application platform and binance a cryptocurrency exchange have burned their tokens the problem with token burning however is that companies need funds to buy back the tokens from investors before they can burn them said cosimo s chapman but many of these startups do not have the cash to burn their tokens because of the decline in the value of their own coins it has become a vicious cycle analysts said companies need their investors to use their tokens to grow their platform and network but their currencies have become pure speculative investments however by removing their tokens from circulation the startups limit the growth of their products which rely on the use of these digital assets their business model is predicated on increasing the value of their protocol tokens said josh stein chief executive officer at harbor inc in san francisco which runs a platform that helps converts securities into tokens backed by assets such as real estate the big beatdown in valuations is a big threat to their business models he said

authored by pepe escobar via the strategic culture foundation cold war 2 0 has hit south america with a bang pitting the us and expected minions against the four key pillars of in progress eurasia integration russia china iran and turkey it s the oil stupid but there s way more than meets the oily eye caracas has committed the ultimate cardinal sin in the eyes of exceptionalistan oil trading bypassing the us dollar or us controlled exchanges remember iraq remember libya yet iran is also doing it turkey is doing it russia is partially on the way and china will eventually trade all its energy in petroyuan with venezuela adopting the petro crypto currency and the sovereign bolivar already last year the trump administration had sanctioned caracas off the international financial system no wonder caracas is supported by china russia and iran they are the real hardcore troika not psycho killer john bolton s cartoonish troika of tyranny fighting against the trump administration s energy dominance strategy which consists essentially in aiming at the total lock down of oil trading in petrodollars forever venezuela is a key cog in the machine psycho killer bolton admitted it on the record it will make a big difference to the united states economically if we could have american oil companies invest in and produce the oil capabilities in venezuela it s not a matter of just letting exxonmobil take over venezuela s massive oil reserves the largest on the planet the key is to monopolize their exploitation in us dollars benefitting a few big oil billionaires once again the curse of natural resources is in play venezuela must not be allowed to profit from its wealth on its own terms thus exceptionalistan has ruled that the venezuelan state must be shattered in the end this is all about economic war cue to the us treasury department imposing new sanctions on pdvsa that amount to a de facto oil embargo against venezuela economic war redux by now it s firmly established what happened in caracas was not a color revolution but an old school us promoted regime change coup using local comprador elites installing as interim president an unknown quantity juan guaido with his obama choirboy looks masking extreme right wing credentials everyone remembers assad must go the first stage in the syrian color revolution was the instigation of civil war followed by a war by proxy via multinational jihadi mercenaries as thierry meyssan has noted the role of the arab league then is performed by the oas now and the role of friends of syria now lying in the dustbin of history is now performed by the lima group the club of washington s vassals instead of al nusra moderate rebels we may have colombian or assorted emirati trained moderate rebel mercenaries contrary to western corporate media fake news the latest elections in venezuela were absolutely legitimate there was no way to tamper with the made in taiwan electronic voting machines the ruling socialist party got 70 percent of the votes the opposition with many parties boycotting it got 30 percent a serious delegation of the latin american council of electoral experts ceela was adamant the election reflected peacefully and without problems the will of venezuelan citizens the american embargo may be vicious in parallel maduro s government may have been supremely incompetent in not diversifying the economy and investing in food self sufficiency major food importers speculating like there s no tomorrow are making a killing still reliable sources in caracas tell that the barrios the popular neighborhoods remain largely peaceful in a country where a full tank of gas still costs less than a can of coke there s no question the chronic shortages of food and medicines in local clinics have forced at least two million people to leave venezuela but the key enforcing factor is the us embargo the un rapporteur to venezuela expert on international law and former secretary of the un human rights council alfred de zayas goes straight to the point much more than engaging in the proverbial demonization of maduro washington is waging economic war against a whole nation it s enlightening to see how the venezuelan people see the charade in a poll conducted by hinterlaces even before the trump administration coup regime change wet dream 86 of venezuelans said they were against any sort of us intervention military or not and 81 of venezuelans said they were against us sanctions so much for benign foreign interference on behalf of democracy and human rights the russia china factor analyses by informed observers such as eva golinger and most of all the mision verdad collective are extremely helpful what s certain in true empire of chaos mode is that the american playbook beyond the embargo and sabotage is to foment civil war dodgy armed groups have been active in the caracas barrios acting in the dead of night and amplifying social unrest on social media still guaido holds absolutely no power inside the country his only chance of success is if he manages to install a parallel government cashing in on the oil revenue and having washington arrest government members on trumped up charges irrespective of neocon wet dreams adults at the pentagon should know that an invasion of venezuela may indeed metastasize into a tropical vietnam quagmire the brazilian strongman in waiting vice president and retired general hamilton mourao already said there will be no military intervention psycho killer bolton s by now infamous notepad stunt about 5 000 troops to colombia is a joke these would have no chance against the arguably 15 000 cubans who are in charge of security for the maduro government cubans have demonstrated historically they are not in the business of handing over power it all comes back to what china and russia may do china is venezuela s largest creditor maduro was received by xi jinping last year in beijing getting an extra 5 billion in loans and signing at least 20 bilateral agreements president putin offered his full support to maduro over the phone diplomatically stressing that destructive interference from abroad blatantly violates basic norms of international law by january 2016 oil was as low as 35 a barrel a disaster to venezuela s coffers maduro then decided to transfer 49 9 of the state ownership in pdvsa s us subsidiary citgo to russian rosneft for a mere 1 5 billion loan this had to send a wave of red lights across the beltway those evil russians were now part owners of venezuela s prime asset late last year still in need of

in the last column sunday gleaner february 3 2019 i asked a few simple questions about the kingston refinery the first column in this series sunday gleaner january 27 2019 provided some insight into the two basic questions that i summarise below a why did esso build a refinery in jamaica i esso owned the crude oil production in venezuela ii the amway refinery in venezuela provided intermediary products that were added to the crude oil before shipping it to jamaica iii margins on crude oil and products it supplied from venezuela were sufficient to support the financial viability of a simple downstream refining operation headlines delivered to your inbox sign up for the gleaner s morning and evening newsletters iv differentials in the freight rates for clean and dirty oil tankers provided an incentive to ship spiked crude oil to process at a simple hydro skimming refinery v esso would have the monopoly over the supply of petroleum products to the jamaican market vi a twenty year tax holiday granted to esso provided an additional financial incentive under the agreed pricing formula esso was required to set the ex refinery selling price for refined products based on a monthly average of the daily postings from the caribbean refineries aruba curaçao and amway refinery in venezuela b why did esso request a small refinery differential and finally decided to sell the refinery to the government the refining cost of a small refinery in jamaica was much higher than the cost of refining in the larger caribbean refineries as the kingston refinery pricing formula was based on an average of the caribbean postings once crude oil margins disappeared owing to the nationalisation of the oil industry in venezuela the kingston refinery was unable to recover its operating costs and was no more financially attractive a tax holiday alone did not provide enough incentive to continue the refining operations without additional financial support from the government the tax holiday expired in 1982 and the government refused to extend it as a result the refinery s bottom line became red the government was happy to oblige esso by buying the refinery as it believed that it could turn the kingston refinery into a commercially profitable operation however this could only be achieved through creative accounting plus shifting the basis for the ex refinery pricing formula from the caribbean average to the us gulf postings a region that was a net importer of petroleum and petroleum products esso however knew that even the larger refineries in the caribbean were having financial difficulties and were likely to shut down which they eventually did esso was happy to walk away with a cheque that was cashed in new york the very next day how do i know because the man who carried the cheque to new york in a briefcase chained to his wrist told me when he was a member of my world bank team that was developing the least cost petroleum supply options for the small pacific island countries i do recall offering to finance a similar study for the caribbean island countries but jamaica would not have it fearing that it might negatively affect the kingston refinery in the last column i briefly discussed the persistent operational losses that the refinery has sustained over the years and its management s dexterity to explain such losses by blaming them on events beyond the control of the management the refinery was here to stay in today s column we take a look at jamaica s structural adjustment programme that was launched in the 1990s with the support of the world bank and the imf this programme would have implications for the kingston refinery structural adjustment the government had agreed with the world bank and the imf to restructure the economy and embark on an ambitious economic reform agenda the reforms among others included an extensive privatisation programme covering public utilities and a large number of commercially oriented entities and services together with the deregulation and privatisation of sugar petroleum and power sectors the immediate focus of this programme was to improve economic efficiency through trade policy reforms deregulation privatisation and the establishment of a regulatory framework to provide comfort and predictability to potential private investors the creation of the office of the utilities regulation our an umbrella regulatory agency in 1995 was one such action for which i spearheaded the study that the world bank financed in pursuance of this programme most prices marketing and distribution channels were deregulated general subsidies on food were relaxed and quantitative restrictions were lifted along with the shutting down of some trade monopolies one noteworthy element of this programme was to adjust tariffs to conform to caricom s common external tariffs cet this development would have profound implications for the kingston refinery deregulation of the petroleum sector prior to the start of the liberalisation process all aspects of the petroleum industry were regulated a government appointed commission played a key role in fixing prices and trade margins the commission s members had no expertise in the petroleum industry however it determined and approved operating margins for haulage contractors gasolene retail outlets and margins for marketing companies there were frequent complaints from marketers and union actions and strikes by haulage contractors pump attendants and sometimes retailers under this framework the kingston refinery enjoyed a defacto monopoly for the import of petroleum and petroleum products following the purchase by the government the ex refinery pricing formula had been restructured to reflect so called opportunity cost it was designed to provide operating margins to the refinery and keep it profitable by virtue that the refinery collected taxes on petroleum products and sent a hefty monthly cheque to the treasury the ministry of finance was happy with the arrangements a situation the refinery used to its advantage as the refinery had persistent operational issues and ran at below its capacity it made up for total product demand in jamaica by direct import of refined products thus controlling about 95 per cent of the domestic market marketers main role was limited to being wholesalers with some ownership of retail outlets as part of the reform programme the government of jamaica goj launched a phased deregulation of the petroleum industry first by decontrolling the domestic petroleum prices except for kerosene for domestic use which was subsidised for environmental and social reasons and allowing a full pass through of the higher international oil prices including devaluation effects to the consumer imposition of common external tariffs in 1993 the goj implemented the second phase of the deregulation by removing the de facto monopoly of the kingston refinery to import petroleum and petroleum products through the imposition of common external tariffs on refined petroleum products but the ability of other marketers to import products was constrained due to a lack of terminalling storage facilities more and more the refinery was operating as an oil import terminal rather than a strict refining unit the harmonisation of cet granted to the kingston refinery a 10 per cent protection on its refining operations a cet of five per cent was imposed on refinery feedstock crude oil and semi finished products that the refinery imported and 15 per cent on the refined products there was an understanding that if the refinery could not make a product the direct importation of that product by any approved importer could receive a tax waiver the issue of tax waiver on unleaded gasolene granted to a marketing company was a result of this proviso however the refinery claimed that it could make unleaded gasolene and no such waiver should have been granted but the reality is a different story in the meanwhile the refinery was continuously receiving tax waivers sometimes retroactively and used the system to its advantage it is good to be owned by the government zia mian a retired

the successive events in venezuela are actually related to the western conflict with china the us imports a significant amount of venezuela s oil production and america will not allow china to exercise control over an important oil supplier venezuela which is currently suffering from record rates of inflation has turned to china as a source of loans china has responded by providing loan after loan many of which are now coming due and must be repaid concerns are growing in washington about the increasing chinese influence in venezuela and in latin america in general one of the reasons for the us demand to rewrite the nafta agreement with mexico was that the chinese currency had become second in circulation after the mexican peso which posed a threat to us economic security in a neighboring country america is dealing with this threat in a unified fashion as president trump has stepped up pressure by applying sanctions and recognizing venezuela s opposition leader it is clear that the threat of china must be taken seriously and an end must be put to its ambitions in a region that has always been considered to traditionally be in the western camp it is surprising that venezuela a founding state of opec and an important oil producing country has experienced severe political turmoil and threats of sanctions without this affecting world oil prices we are living in a new world governed by different factors not merely by the laws of supply and demand it is also very clear that venezuela is not syria and that it is a real red line and not a virtual red line venezuela is now a pivotal point in the determination of us national security the step of the us recognizing the other president and of not recognizing maduro as venezuela s legitimate president is unprecedented and an escalation of the situation brazil colombia and argentina which are all pivotal and very influential countries in latin america have supported the us decision it is clear that latin america is an important battleground in the new cold war between china and the west this is a war with new weapons and different battle sites these new cold war battles will test the political and economic capabilities of all of the parties involved
tns gen z is poised to be the largest source of homebuyers in the united states the post millennial generation or those born after 1996 make up about 32 percent of the population and according to a recent report by realtor com 80 percent of them want to own a home before they turn 30 for kids who are still in high school or just graduating from college homeownership aspirations might seem far off but the overwhelming attitude toward homeownership could have roots in the economic turndown their parents faced gen z parents were gen xers and many gen xers went through the recession it could be that they saw what their parents faced and they have a different take on owning a home says danielle hale chief economist at realtor com strong job market stagnant wages the good news is that this generation is graduating into a strong job market hale points out the unemployment rate has stayed near the 4 percent mark for the last five months while more than 300 000 jobs were added in january the bad news is that wages for recent college graduates are relatively flat according to a report by korn ferry researchers analyzed salaries of 310 000 entry level jobs in the u s from almost 1 000 organizations they found that 2018 college grads would earn 50 390 a 2 8 percent hike from 2017 for many gen zers this mean preparing early to become homeowners at 31 which is the median age of first time homebuyers gen zers 10 year home buying plan in 5 steps in 2031 the median home price will be 386 310 according to realtor com to save up for a 10 percent down payment and closing costs gen zers will have to save 304 every month for the next 12 years if they want to avoid private mortgage insurance or pmi which can hike their monthly house payment up by a few hundred dollars they would need to save 608 per month or a 20 percent down payment talk to a financial advisor college graduates who have no experience budgeting their finances would benefit from talking to a financial advisor says michael biggica founder of pixel financial planning in san francisco biggica has worked with young professionals who have no idea how to maximize their savings i ve talked to some young people and many seem to be rather mature the ones who would benefit from an advisor are usually less confident with their financial choices there s more credit card debt biggica says i think one of the biggest benefits of a financial advisor for gen zers is to understand budget strategy where do i put that extra dollar budget basics begin with creating an emergency fund before saving for a house biggica says get rid of credit card debt gen zers who have started to accrue credit card debt should pay off the debt now keep the credit cards and build strong financial habits says gary boyer senior mortgage specialist at directors mortgage in portland ore a strong credit score will help borrowers get the most competitive interest rate and shave thousands off of their loan learn how to build discipline early on boyer says take advantage of free money don t leave cash on the table biggica says young borrowers should talk to their employers about homeownership programs as well as research programs offered by both the federal and local government don t forget to look into fha loans and va loans boyer echoes that advice saying that many employers do offer home buying programs but don t always do a great job of communicating them to their employees save it like you re already spending it for aspiring homeowners who have the luxury of living with their parents or can afford to devote a big chunk of their income to savings use that opportunity to sock as much money away as possible says boyer i encourage people to live like you already have that payment if i m going to have a 2 000 monthly house payment then i m going to put that money away i think it s smart for young people to get used to those payments if they want to own a home i also encourage them to put the money into a separate account so they don t see it boyer says be smart about where you save your money an enormous benefit of technology is that savers can shop around for the best interest rates without leaving their house the worst thing people can do is assume that big banks offer the best deals says biggica pointing to online banks as a viable alternative a lot of times i see people that have their money in savings and it s growing at 0 2 percent that 22 year old might be at a bank of america and they aren t taking advantage of the full range of what bank of america can offer they can get a better deal at an online bank biggica says for long term goals some gen zers might consider a hybrid blend of stocks and bonds which are more aggressive savings vehicles in order to go this route savers should talk to a financial advisor who can help them invest their cash as well as detail the risks involved although saving for a 10 or 20 percent down payment is an excellent goal the average down payment is 7 percent for homebuyers under 30 hale points out there are also a bevy of programs that only require 3 or 3 5 percent down payments these programs can be helpful for buyers who want to lock in a low interest rate now or are in an affordable market and don t want to miss the boat by waiting years until they save for a bigger down payment 2019 bankrate com distributed by tribune

integrating housing with rapid transit in a commercial manner like tokyo achieves could be a successful urbanisation model for the anglo world the political battle for middle class voters in many anglo world countries is moving onto the housing front many different urbanisation models are being considered tokyo in particular is gaining a lot of attention below is my understanding of the key aspects of japanese urbanism and how it may apply to my anglo world country of new zealand ontakesan shops note the urban design layout and the lack of cars source mayo_rob the way tokyo has integrated trains with property development is brilliant 2 unmatchable in their efficiency reliability and speed japanese trains represent the cutting edge of innovative modern transport pointing and calling is part of japanese train services impressive safety procedures 3 an important aspect of rails success in japan is their excellent service culture there is a holistic consideration of all aspects of service from facilitating affordable housing fast and speedy journeys that take advantage of the latest technology to supporting an ecosystem of high quality commercial enterprises at destinations 4 public transport in tokyo does not need to be subsidised because japan does not spatially subsidise motor cars in japan when you purchase a vehicle you must prove that you own or rent a private parking space suitable for the vehicle there is no assumption that motorists have the right to store their vehicle in public spaces for free scarce city spaces are allocated by pricing pricing can be a very effective tool for allocating scarce resources 5 even though tokyo is the largest city in the world it has surprisingly affordable housing for example the average rent of a two bedroom apartment in tokyo is us 1000 a month which at current exchange rates is about nz 340 per week tokyo s rents have been stable for the last decade in comparison in new zealand the median rental value for a two bedroom flat in auckland is 490 week and in wellington it is 465 week tokyo and japanese cities more broadly have managed to stay affordable by building more japanese cities are able to build quickly because they have scrapped regulations that delay or forbid new housing construction in japan zoning types and land use regulation is largely made at the national level which minimises nimby objections land prices in inner tokyo are considerably higher than in london whereas house prices are significantly lower the explanation james gleeson argues is that land in tokyo is used more productively to produce more housing than equivalent land in london competitive transport mechanisms combined with competitive urban housing intensification characteristics has allowed tokyo to be a relatively affordable city this provides evidence that city land supply is not necessary fixed this contentious point is at the heart of theoretical debates about unaffordable housing 6 new zealand transport economist david lupton has a thesis which i believe gives the theoretical backing for why tokyo urbanism works so well david believes we need appropriate charges for infrastructure and services so the choices people make do not impose financial burdens on others 7 urbanist alain bertaud in his new book order without design how markets shape cities confirms this theoretical approach parking p 199 congestion road pricing p 200 8 these sort of spatial economic ideas i amalgamated into a successful cities understand spatial economics paper in the future will the practice of allowing people the right to store 2 tonne cars free of charge in public places be considered as mad as bloodletting 9 interestingly japan copied germany s land readjustment practices to make room for urban expansion this is how i recommend new zealand acquires affordable land for integrated housing and rapid transport projects
advocate the baton rouge la feb 10 a new federal program pitched as a way to aid low income communities is ramping up across louisiana but after a political scramble to make various struggling areas eligible for the tax break it s investors and real estate developers who are starting to reap the benefits last year more than 150 census tracts in louisiana were designated as opportunity zones under a provision in the 2017 tax cut bill designed to encourage investment in economically hard hit areas with gov john bel edwards responsible for selecting from the nearly 600 eligible census tracts in louisiana public records show local officials small town mayors businesspeople and even u s rep cedric richmond lobbied the governor via the state s economic development office on which areas should be chosen the designation from the office of louisiana economic development was highly sought after because it could translate into potentially millions of dollars in tax savings for anyone who recently purchased or is willing to invest in properties or businesses in these areas the local surge in interest echoes a national boom louisiana supporters of the initiative are touting early successes while financial firms are creating investment funds and figuring out rules that are still under development at the same time even some business minded observers worry that the program won t help people in poor areas so much as accelerate gentrification or add additional tax savings to projects that would have happened anyway new orleans booming freret street corridor is now an opportunity zone as are the struggling streets just a few blocks away investing in either spot will offer the same tax break will it be a results blind tax haven asked rob lalka head of the lepage center for entrepreneurship at tulane university or will it be an opportunity to really move capital toward key projects that are going to matter for the community opportunity zones were added to the 1 5 trillion 2017 tax cut bill by south carolina republican sen tim scott based on a plan developed at a think tank funded by tech investor sean parker the idea was to create tax benefits for investors to help fund businesses in areas skipped over during the current economic expansion under the program instead of paying capital gains taxes when selling a high flying stock or a hot piece of property investors can defer taxes on their profits by reinvesting into a property or business located within an opportunity zone by holding onto the investment for several years they can receive a discount on those deferred taxes when the bill eventually comes due and if they hold the investment for more than 10 years there are no capital gains taxes on the profits of that new investment the tax break has no cap on the amount of benefits allowed each year there are also currently no reporting requirements skepticism said justified investors and developers are jumping at the opportunity and while many advocates for low income areas are optimistic they worry whether the benefits will accrue to neighborhoods and communities in need of investment chris tyson the head of the east baton rouge redevelopment authority said during a recent panel discussion that many efforts have been made to redevelop poor areas in the past but they didn t necessarily transform the areas as intended if you re skeptical it s justified tyson told the group of officials and business owners we want to know what s going to be different this time the program is expected to cost the federal government 1 6 billion in the first decade but most of the tax breaks are expected in the years after that meaning the cost to the government could rise another potential hiccup according to tax law analyst samantha jacoby of the left leaning center on budget and policy priorities is that the program does not include any requirements that local residents benefit from the investments wealthy people not poor people are the ones who have capital gains she noted and areas that are already attractive to investors are getting the benefit such as the new york city neighborhood where amazon has announced its intention to build a new headquarters while the new tax break enables investors to accumulate more wealth it includes no requirements to ensure that local residents benefit said chuck marr a colleague of jacoby at the cbpp where he focuses on federal tax policy when the law was being crafted tulane s lalka said it was pitched as a way of enticing people to invest in start ups and small businesses but since it s been enacted real estate has dominated the activity surrounding the program influx of recommendations in louisiana the nominating process was a mad dash that included lobbying from countless economic development agencies politicians and businesspeople across the state all hoping to get their land or their district included developer buckner barkley owner of marrero land improvement association made several recommendations on where to put the zones requesting that the edwards administration put them in areas where the company owns property after the governor picked two of his nine recommendations barkley has more than 300 acres of land in an opportunity zone near the former avondale shipyard site barkley whose company has made several donations to state senate president john alario of westwego requested that alario support his request our company has real estate holdings in each of the nine census tracts shown on the plans said his letter i would appreciate it if john could bring this matter to the attention of the governor alario s office sent it on to the governor marrero land is a major landowner in the west bank alario said in an interview adding that the request was the only one his office received we hoped if they were selected it would create jobs alario said that if anyone else had contacted him requesting a tract be included he would have passed it along to the governor s office also richmond who represents most of new orleans and parts of baton rouge in congress lobbied for a host of tracts in his district james bernhard a staffer for richmond wrote to the governor s office in march that richmond had personally compiled a list of census tracts for the program he also talked with edwards about it according to the email because of my knowledge of the creation of opportunity zones as well as my familiarity of the neighborhoods in my district i wanted to ensure that i had input in the selection of the census tracts richmond said in a statement it is important to me that programs like this one best meet the needs of my district the legislation was written with congressional input in mind i also believe that the governor and i were on the same page with this issue after the nominations were over led secretary don pierson wrote back to richmond notifying him that the tract that encompasses louis armstrong international airport in kenner which richmond recommended was not eligible however he wrote the tract directly north of the airport was eligible and made the list wide ranging zones sidney torres iii who is part of a group of investors who own the old ford plant in arabi is hoping the fact the property is now located in an opportunity zone will help attract someone to redevelop the 225 000 square foot building torres an edwards campaign donor said he did not lobby for the tract to be included pierson said the administration solicited multiple rounds of public comment when picking the zones and it studied which areas were likely to see economic activity if nominated zones are also designated in walker on land that includes a 127 acre tract that local economic development officials are trying to sell to investors an area in terrebonne parish where the isle de jean charles community is being relocated from its sinking coastal home and tracts in caddo and jackson parishes much of new orleans central business district is now an opportunity zone so too is the largely undeveloped area upriver from the ernest n morial convention center where tourism officials and local developers joe jaeger and darryl berger hope to build a 558 million 1 200 room hotel land adjacent to that proposed development the site of a massive defunct power plant owned by jaeger is also in the zone records show it is not a low income area but it was designated as an opportunity zone anyway under a provision of the law that allows some areas contiguous to low income areas to receive the designation troy villafarra managing director at the new orleans based investment firm crescent growth capital recommended those areas get the designation his firm has already raised 16 million for an opportunity fund and plans to raise as much as 60 million annually while he isn t involved in the hotel project he hopes to piggyback off the development via nearby properties in baton rouge all of downtown and parts of the city s mid city corridor which has in recent years attracted a rush of investment are enveloped in opportunity zones anthony kimble one of the developers of the electric depot redevelopment in the fast growing mid city area said he hopes to use the new tax break for part of the project a few blocks west of electric depot on the corner of 3rd and florida streets downtown real estate broker jim allen is marketing the state national life building for sale he is touting the opportunity zone designation of the area a fruitful real estate deal among early movers perhaps no one timed things better than baton rouge developer mike wampold last february he purchased the 21 story chase south tower in downtown baton rouge with a plan to turn portions of the office tower into luxury apartments three months later he sold 144 elk place a former office building in new orleans cbd for 27 6 million to a florida company that sells timeshares and manages vacation properties both properties are in areas recently certified as opportunity zones we basically took the gains to sell that building and created our opportunity fund wampold said it just so happened we acquired the chase south tower in 2018 and it just so happened we were selling a building in new orleans in 2018 he said wampold said it remains to be seen if this program will differ from the many existing tax incentives out there more distressed areas will likely see some opportunity zone projects he added but it s not going to change the face of real estate development i think you ll see more activity in areas that have the ability to support new construction wampold said villafarra said the opportunity zone program probably won t be geared solely toward those types of projects even though his firm has looked at things like affordable housing developments it s hard for opportunity zones to purely focus on community type projects he said you need to have some expectation of appreciation but it is projects like high end condos that have advocates for poor and working class areas concerned in new orleans some worry the program will fuel gentrification and displacement of residents who are already dealing with issues of housing affordability they investors and developers could bring mixed income buildings with some affordable and some market rate housing in areas where some residents are being displaced said maxwell ciardullo policy director at the greater new orleans fair housing action center they could also bring luxury apartments he said ___ c 2019 the advocate baton rouge la visit the advocate
