source introduction of zimdollar to sink economy say analysts the zimbabwe independent june 28 2019 the decision by government this week to abolish the multi currency regime and re introduce the zimbabwean dollar as the sole legal tender could be catastrophic as the local currency s value may tumble against major currencies plunging the country into hyperinflation by tinashe kairiza while some captains of industry and analysts welcomed the move others were sceptical and critical the zimdollar which was initially abandoned in 2009 after being ravaged by severe hyperinflation this week became the country s sole currency through statutory instrument si 142 of 2019 known as the reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz legal tender regulations in 2016 government introduced the bond currency to the basket of currencies a fiat currency which was ostensibly meant to incentivise exporting firms these regulations may be cited as the reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz legal tender regulations 2019 subject to section 3 with effect from 24th june 2019 the british pound united states dollar south african rand botswana pula and any other foreign currency whatsoever shall no longer be legal tender alongside the zimbabwe dollar in any transactions in zimbabwe part of the si said accordingly the zimbabwean dollar shall with effect from the 24 june 2019 but subject to section 3 be the sole legal tender in zimbabwe in all transactions the rationale to abandon the multi currency system which brought relative stability on the market when it was introduced in 2009 as explained by finance minister mthuli ncube this week is to restore the central bank s monetary authority thereby containing spiralling commodity prices and inflation what we are trying to do is restore full monetary policy where the central bank can conduct monetary policy using the array of tools that are necessary for managing monetary policy such as interest rates use of a monetary policy committee to govern things like targeting money balances or even targeting inflation ncube said basically the multi currency regime which had by the way become a mono currency in favour of the us dollar was favouring those with access to us dollars those with access to us dollars were facing no change in inflation at all for the last three years however the basis for adopting a basket of currencies a decade ago was supported by the need to stabilise zimbabwe s fragile economy in the absence of macro economic fundamentals which resulted in the decimation of the local dollar amid spiralling inflation which peaked to 89 7 sextillion percent on november 14 2008 now a decade later zimbabwe still deep in the throes of an intractable economic crisis is reeling from unstable macro economic fundamentals not conducive for the return of the local dollar the local unit a combination of electronic balances bond coins and notes already in circulation has failed to hold its own against major currencies particularly the ever firming united states dollar official figures show that inflation has risen to 97 8 though renowned us economist steve hanke forecasts it to be hovering at more than 300 ironically treasury projects inflation to recede below 14 by year end tamed as it says by the range of austerity measures currently being implemented with zimbabwe s agriculture sector which used to be the mainstay of the economy ruined by former president robert mugabe s chaotic land reform programme of 2000 experts say the southern african country s decision to abandon the multi currency system while upholding the local dollar as the sole legal tender could lead to an all too familiar path of hyperinflation ditching the basket of currencies analysts say will exert inflationary pressures on the local currency unless backed by foreign currency gold reserves and exports in february government liberalised the exchange rate resulting in the rtgs dollar tumbling in value against the us dollar and other currencies it is now pegged at 6 3 to the us dollar on the interbank market while on the parallel market it has soared to 13 critics of the return of the zimbabwean dollar which is now the monetary unit effectively in circulation say that it is imperative to ensure macro economic stability and restore public confidence before the country can start trading with its local currency they say the real value of a currency lies in the public confidence besides its intrinsic and market value but with memories of zimbabwe s hyperinflation era still fresh in their memories confidence appears to have waned as the local unit continues to tumble against currencies of choice necessitating government intervention coupled with that zimbabwe is also struggling to extinguish an estimated us 20 billion debt stock a situation which has restricted the country from unlocking fresh lines of credit perceived to be key towards mending the sbattered economy bindura university commerce lecturer felix chari said in the absence of structural economic reforms treasury s decision to abandon the multi currency regime would stoke inflationary pressures and render the local unit worthless it was premature to reintroduce the local currency in the absence of sound macro economic fundamentals required to stabilise the economy the zimbabwean dollar is vulnerable to inflation due to low levels of productivity and exports inflation will continue to rise as the zimbabwean dollar devalues chari contends former finance minister tendai biti who served in the inclusive government that saw zimbabwe adopting dollarisation as an official currency policy said the scrapping of the multi currency regime would spark civil unrest with retail shops running dry and the local unit depreciating it is insanity it is total madness you cannot introduce a new currency when the macro economic fundamentals are not there we have a crisis of confidence a crisis of legitimacy biti said you are going to see a massive shortage of goods in the supermarkets you are going to see disinvestment in the country there will be massive externalisation you will see massive civil unrest it is a major security threat however other analysts say the zimdollar s return was necessary even in these conditions

reminiscent of the buzz around the buenos aires g20 summit in late 2018 investors are waiting with bated breath running into the group of 20 summit in osaka japan with trump xi the anticipated trump xi trade discussion dominating sentiment into the summit and expected to set the market tone for the near term since trade talks collapsed in may global trade prospects have deteriorated markedly as the worlds largest economies continue to spar with reciprocated tariff hikes and company targeted restrictions erecting fresh barriers and spurring a strong risk off market undertone moreover with global growth already set to cool the impact of slumping demand could exacerbate an already muted growth outlook and bolster the trend towards policy easing evident among developed market central banks since the turn of the year while the direct impact of deteriorating trade is expected to be most felt by the directly involved parties with virtually no markets immune to developments in the worlds two largest economies the implications for global growth prospects are grave the trade relations between china and the united states are difficult they are contributing to the slowdown of the global economy said european commission president jean claude juncker over the last week tentative signs of a reconciliation with us and chinese officials reopening dialogue ahead of the tet a tet between trump and xi have provided a glimmer of optimism for markets tempering the flight to safe haven assets as markets await the outcome of the crucial talks recent comments from the trump administration suggest that resuming trade talks is possible rather than immediate full scale tariffs but markets already appear to be positioned for it as per the rally in the australian dollar and new zealand dollar over the last two weeks wrote ing economists adding our economists note it still looks as if things will get worse before they get better meaning that any possible relief rally in risk assets after the g20 meeting may be short lived arriving in japan of friday president donald trump sought to set the tone for talks stating that he had not promised contrary to speculation in newswires a reprieve from escalating tariffs in the trade war nevertheless the us president struck an optimistic tone telling reporters that at a minimum it will be productive we ll see what happens and what comes out of it chinese officials have continued to call for compromise from both sides hopes that could be in jeopardy should trump not shift on his tariffs we hope the u s side can meet china halfway and work hard together to ensure the meeting achieves positive results said chinese foreign ministry spokesperson geng shuang adding this accords with the interests of both countries and is what the international community is hoping for advertisement the outlook in this area appears to be much more optimistic with trump telling reporters that i think we re going to have some very big things to announce very big trade deal ahead of the talks with pm modi us dollar treads water as trump signals no tariff reprieve for china us dollar exchange rates were relatively steady heading into

imminent aggressive fed easing is partly priced out wrote ing s chief emea fx and ir strategist petr krpata canadian dollar lifted by internal drivers while the canadian dollar might be one of the most sensitive g10 currencies to shifts in market risk sentiment partly due to the loonie s oil coupled nature and oil prices tendency to fluctuate in line with risk appetite internal drivers remain

s april gdp data will likely confirm this nonetheless usd cad may stay supported above 1 310 as our economists expect the year on year reading to come in slightly below consensus at 1 4 while the cad could run into considerable pressure should the weekend s g20 developments inject a fresh bout of risk aversion any perceived negatives will also impact the us economy and could offset the drag on the loonie the g20 meeting is a material risk event however its impact is somewhat neutralized by the fed s recent communication and chair powell s willingness to act wrote scotia s osborne adding that from a technical perspective short term usd cad remains bearish momentum indicators are bearish the dmi s are confirming and the adx trend strength indicators has climbed above 25 the trend signifying threshold for the first time since february
today eu11 economies1 are among the most open economies globally figure 1 their degree of trade openness has increased and the nature of their trade flows has changed rapidly in this millennium in large part because they joined the eu other factors also contributed such as the reform driven by their transition from central planning to market economies and their preparation for eu membership as well as global trends that led to the emergence of global value chains gvcs in this period figure 1 export openness source world bank note eu15 small open includes austria belgium denmark finland netherlands and sweden sea small open includes cambodia korea malaysia and vietnam eu11 includes bulgaria croatia czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania poland romania slovakia and slovenia the unusual nature of the eu11 however important characteristics of eu11 countries differ from those of other countries with similar degrees of trade openness their institutions and their social support systems are less developed than those of small open eu15 countries and their households have less financial savings to smooth their consumption as the capacity of an economy to absorb shocks and manage structural changes depends greatly on the quality of its institutions and social support system this is an important difference within the eu on the other hand similarly open lower middle income countries in other parts of the world are not part of a supra national organisation like the eu they have not adopted the institutional and legal systems of highly developed countries and they are not part of a single market with free movement of capital and labour as trade flows are significantly influenced by the decisions of firms on the location of their production and labour migration these characteristics of eu11 countries are highly relevant if we want to understand how trade and other shocks impact them eu11 countries show many important similarities when it comes to trade integration most importantly the large share of intra eu trade and its implications for growth and development nevertheless there are also important differences among these countries regarding their level of development the composition and quality of their exports and the degree to which they participate in gvcs while most economist would agree on the positive economic effects of closer trade integration at the aggregate level there is an increasing awareness of the importance of other aspects such as income distribution and more broadly equal chances and fairness milanoviċ 2016 oecd 2019 agglomeration effects and the resulting regional disparities and the increasing prices of housing and regional labour market mismatch ebrd 2018 ossa 2019 labour migration and the resulting fiscal and social implications andor 2019 and more lasting impact on societies than previously experienced buti 2019 understanding the impact of shocks the recent crisis in europe demonstrated that the focus on narrowly defined aggregate economic growth and economic resilience is not sufficient to understand the longer term impact of economic shocks these shocks stimulate growth but can also trigger a crisis a broader focus that entails social and political aspects is necessary to understand current developments and to formulate adequate polices székely 2019 put differently it also matters who benefits and who loses out from rapid trade integration and convergence who absorbs the hits during a crisis and how as well as how different groups in society winners and losers and society as a whole react to the challenges trade integration brings about if left unaddressed negative social trends created by market forces can reverse reforms and ultimately lead to an erosion of growth potential and economic resilience székely and ward warmedinger 2018 they can also have major implications for political developments at the national and the european level these may prevent the deepening of european integration global value chains the emergence of gvcs baldwin 2012 baldwin and obuko forthcoming changed the nature and impact of trade integration intra regional value chains currently predominate antras and de gortari 2017 but as trade costs fall the global including european but extra eu component of value chains is likely to increase similarly as the service component of gvc increases rapidly competitive pressure from global markets increases gvcs particularly their service component are strongly impacted by disruptive technological innovation with major impact on the skill structure of labour demand this leads to a constant relocation of the different elements of gvcs this possibly means reshoring certain parts to eu15 but also offshoring of core elements from eu15 to eu11 or to countries outside the eu mayer and head forthcoming this trend is likely to strengthen in the future an inflow of fdi trade integration and the creation of gvcs also drove the inflow of fdi into eu11 countries imports of modern technology and capital deepening as well as a rapid modernisation of the product structure had a positive impact on productivity of local suppliers harding and smarzynska javorcik 2011 hagemejer and muck forthcoming this confirms the empirical analysis in alfaro and chen 2012 which shows that multinational production causes both knowledge spillovers and factor reallocation in domestic markets policies that make this more likely include improving credit access and labour supply particularly skilled labour while eliminating regulatory barriers these are typical of reforms in eu11 countries as with trade many of the underlying forces that promoted fdi were global geographical proximity helped but eu accession provided fertile ground for these forces to work as it helped improve institutions and create a higher degree of legal certainty for investors buiter and lubin 2019 eu11 countries benefited significantly from the reduction of barriers to trade merlevede and purice 2019 have estimated that supplying inputs to a multinational just across the border enhances productivity only when countries share an eu border these spillover effects become even stronger when borders become seamless as is the case in the schengen area as a result inward fdi excluding special purpose entities or spes relative to gdp in eu11 countries has caught up with the trend observed in the most developed small open economies in the eu and in the world figure 2 the same however has not been true for outward fdi figure 2 stocks of inward and outward fdi in small open eu15 and eu11 countries source unctad note eu15 small open includes austria belgium denmark finland netherlands and sweden eu11 includes bulgaria croatia czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania poland romania slovakia and slovenia unweighted group averages as the overall capital stock relative to gdp is smaller in eu11 than in eu 15 countries the share of fdi in total stock of capital is higher figure 3 put differently foreign capital and thus foreign influence in the corporate sector is more important in these countries particularly in their export tradable sector the technological sophistication of fdi is also significantly above the rest of the economy a large part of r d takes place in these companies and they employ a higher share of skilled labour than their share in the private economy figure 3 value added produced by foreign controlled enterprises source eurostat note eu15 small open includes austria belgium denmark finland netherlands and sweden eu11 inlcudes bulgaria croatia czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania poland romania slovakia and slovenia unweighted group averages proximity to germany where companies were among the first in the eu to create of gvcs and to other main european markets and their abundance of low cost but relatively skilled labour made eu11 countries perfect targets for integration into european mostly german global value chains they were in the right place at the right time in the right condition to benefit from this global process the closer to the centre of gravity and the better the transport infrastructure the more so even within countries export oriented companies particularly those that are part of a gvc are predominantly foreign owned and highly concentrated in certain regions increasing fdi has further accelerated the already strong agglomeration effects and increased the demand for higher skills and the wage premium they command fdi is highly concentrated in main urban areas particularly in capitals and in areas that are close to the main west european manufacturing firms creating gvcs szabo 2019 figure 4 regional differences in inward fdi in eu11 countries source statistics of national central banks and or national statistical institutes economic responses during the crisis a model based simulation one of the salient characteristics of the crisis experience of eu11 countries was that in many of these countries the decline in domestic demand has been much bigger relative to the decline in gdp than in the core eu countries reasons include credit driven consumption and a real estate boom in the run up to the crisis at this stage the real estate boom seems unlikely to be repeated though in some countries household credit and house prices have picked up sharply with the help of calibrated dsge models we can pinpoint two important characteristics of eu11 countries that can explain a large part of this phenomenon and will remain relevant moving forward a large share of foreign ownership of productive capacities without a comparable magnitude of outward fdi a large share of hand to mouth consumers that is people who have little savings and thus have to live on their current income this is partly a consequence of the first characteristic as the charts in figure 5 show these characteristics have important implications for how the economy reacts to a global recessionary shock in an eu11 country with high foreign ownership of productive assets relative to an eu15 country and relative to the hypothetical case of an eu11 country without sizable foreign ownership regarding the former comparison which is more relevant to understanding recent and future economic developments in eu11 countries domestic demand particularly consumption declines more sharply the decline in investment is bigger reflecting the accelerator effect of higher consumption decline since exports follow similar paths trade balance paths are very different figure 5 response to a recessionary shock in eu11 countries with and without major foreign ownership of productive capital source economic commission dg ecfin staff calculations using quest model note quest models calibrated to eu11 and rest of eu countries the model used for eu11 foreign own assumes a high share of foreign ownership of productive capacities in eu11 countries models assume flexible exchange rate regimes given the high share of non tradables in consumptions a much larger decline in consumption which is not fully passed on to imports implies that non tradable sectors decline much more in an eu11 economy with sizable foreign ownership moreover despite relatively flexible labour markets hysteresis is still significant equally importantly investments recover more gradually in short growth potential may be reduced more thus not only actual production but also potential output can be more volatile than in more matured economies as figure 6 shows this matches real life figure 6 potential output growth 2001 2018 source ameco note eu15 small open includes austria belgium denmark finland netherlands and sweden eu11 inlcudes bulgaria croatia czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania poland romania slovakia and slovenia adjustment to shocks a crisis tends to accelerate the relocation of production and reorganisation of gvcs as it puts renewed pressure on multinational firms to reduce costs zlate 2016 as figure 1 showed after the initial shock eu11 countries benefited from the relocation effect in the recent crisis because their export openness increased significantly after a temporary crisis related decline summing these two effects a bigger shock to the non tradable sector and a renewed reallocation of modern export oriented production to eu11 countries winners win more and losers lose more the growth potential at the aggregate level may have been largely restored but the vulnerabilities have increased in the absence of an efficient state with high quality public expenditure and social support system this may destabilise societies and domestic politics reversals in reforms in the region is a likely manifestation of this impact székely and ward warmedinger 2018 in figure 5 the models incorporated exchange rate flexibility flexible exchange rate regimes especially when they are allowed to work help absorb external shocks and can be particularly helpful when external shocks are asymmetric model simulations confirm this without this volatility in output increases joining the euro area takes away the exchange rate as an adjustment tool but eu11 countries that have joined the euro area had given up this tool beforehand a major part of the excess output volatility in these countries during the recent crisis was related to the excessive macroeconomic imbalances that had been accumulated in the boom years prior to the crisis the focus should be on avoiding this in the future in fact the macroeconomic imbalances procedure and more broadly surveillance under the european semester process should help some eu11 countries have not yet joined the euro area or expressed interest to do so they have floating rates as an adjustment tool at their disposal it served them well during the crisis imf 2016 though of course could not eliminate the consequences of poor policies with foreign exchange denominated loans greatly reduced they can use exchange rate flexibility more than before the crisis but as in the crisis exchange rate flexibility will not be a panacea for poor macroeconomic policies and lack of structural reforms just the opposite with poor polices the volatility of the exchange rate can well aggravate the situation policy options policy options to react to trade shocks can range from the short termism of protecting rents tied to vested interests to longer term strategies of adopting appropriate structural reforms and enhancing the quality of institutions structural reforms may help the economy to remain an attractive investment destination or move up the value chain leap frogging others currently we see both these responses trade protectionism of any form would be particularly detrimental for eu11 countries vandenbussche et al 2017 and their policymakers understand this well less well understood by them is that restrictions on fdi in their non tradable sectors such as retail trade and sectors that are yet less exposed to competition from the outside certain service sectors also reduce their competitiveness and capacity to attract fdi in the tradable sector blanchard 2006 we know the reforms accelerate human capital accumulation improve the business environment strengthen institutions reduce corruption that would make a lower middle income country a more desirable destination for fdi and domestic private investment to enhance their growth potential ebrd 2019 berglof et al 2019 these standard reforms help improve allocative efficiency and innovation the country specific recommendations issued to these countries as part of the european semester process reflect this well european commission 2018 and similar recommendations are given to these countries by other international organisations such as the imf the world bank the ebrd or the oecd less emphasised is the need to strengthen local firms to help them to become european or global firms invest abroad and thus create more symmetry between inward and outward fdi in eu11 countries but success on this front may also make eu11 countries more vulnerable to external shocks deltuvaitė 2017 therefore the right balance and sequencing of reforms is needed to make their convergence not only fast but also sustainable economically socially and politically given their strong exposure to global shocks social policy reforms should address all three dimensions pre in and post market to make eu11 countries more socially and thus politically more resilient institutional reforms are key on all fronts and can also help to build capacity and use eu funds more efficiently reforms at the eu level that can mitigate the negative impact of outward labour migration on national social security systems and reforms that can help eu11 countries to strengthen their unemployment systems and diversify away risk related to labour income are such important areas andor 2015 andor and pasimeni 2016 continued capital imports will remain a necessary element of a development strategy and risk diversification is essential for such small and highly specialised open economies the crisis clearly demonstrated the vulnerabilities of debt financing thus reforms that can reduce these vulnerabilities such as the completion of the banking union which is important also for eu11 countries outside the euro area as their banking sectors are dominantly owned by banking groups in the euro area reforms that can make alternative source of finance more easily available such as the completion of the capital market union are also an essential part of such a strategy references alfaro l and m x chen 2012 surviving the global financial crisis foreign ownership

banks sitting on us 1 billion while economy suffers spread the love minister ncube e business zimbabwean banks are currently sitting on nearly a billion united states dollars while the economy is being ravaged by the impact of a us dollar crunch and the pass through effects of steep parallel market foreign currency premiums on prices according to finance and economic development minister professor mthuli ncube given this scenario the treasury chief believes that zimbabwe has adequate foreign currency for its external payments obligations but it is the inefficiency of the nascent interbank market that is causing acute shortages which have fueled price volatility until early 2016 and following dollarisation of the economy in february 2009 zimbabwe had no us dollar liquidity issues under the multi currency regime which allowed the use of the british pound botswana pula and south african rand even as the country did not have a forex trading market to facilitate efficient distribution amid the dollar crunch the escalating parallel market rates have torched a wild run of price increases since the reserve bank of zimbabwe directed banks to separate balances of foreign currency nostro accounts and balances in real time gross settlement rtgs accounts starting from october last year although officially the exchange rate remained at parity between the two currencies rbz governor dr john mangudya said back then that intermingling of balances in fcas and rtgs accounts was discouraging inflows of foreign currency into the economy when the country faced a crippling us dollar crunch at that point zimbabwe had a policy position that prescribed that the united states dollar ranked at par that is to say exchanged 1 to 1 with the local currency made up of electronic dollars rtgs and mobile money balances bond notes and coins minister ncube told business weekly early this week that banks were holding us 888 million which was not finding its way on to the interbank market fast enough to whet the appetite of local importers of a wide range of foreign products in desperation importers have alternatively resorted to getting hard currency on the parallel market where the money due to overwhelming demand sees the greenback exchanging hands at huge premiums passed on to consumers in the form of high prices the extremely high demand for foreign currency and speculative trading in the currencies has seen the parallel market exchange rates changing constantly in a development that has driven inflation through the roof 97 8 percent for may 2019 however minister ncube said while the country had enough foreign currency an inefficient interbank market was the reason the country was experiencing shortages of forex a structural flaw the government said it was working relentlessly to correct with such a scenario zimbabwe s major industries lobby group the confederation of zimbabwe industry czi has started pushing for an independent foreign currency exchange market in the wake of a runaway exchange rate the threat of re dollarisation and rapid depreciation of the rtgs dollar value there is the normal facs then there is the domestic corporate facs and then the individuals domestic fcas the domestic corporate fcas there is us 888 million they have it in there so there is no shortage of foreign currency minister ncube said minister ncube said the acute shortage of hard currency being experienced in the country was because the forex was not being offloaded on the interbank market fast enough for use by needy importers the finance minister said that efforts were currently being made to fine tune the interbank market to ensure transparency and efficiency in the trading of foreign currencies in the country that s what we are fine tuning the market needs to be fined tuned to get better that is exactly what we are doing he said this also comes as industry has demanded that an independent body separate from banks manages the interbank for better transparency this comes as there have been reports that banks were pairing a few particular clients outside of the interbank platform in the trading of foreign currency which was shutting out the majority of customers seeking hard currency from the interbank market they industry are demanding that let it be more transparent and more efficient he said in a draft paper prepared by the czi s economists roundtable the business member organisation said zimbabwe immediately needed a mechanism that allowed bankers to freely trade in a market administered by an independent person or body following challenges on the official foreign exchange market the interbank market it s about efficiency efficiency and efficiency and that is a good thing by the way things have been improving more corporates have been able to access us dollars now from the interbank market it s still not 100 percent efficient but we are making progress and now with this move the mono domestic currency we will see a package around the currency being put in place by the central bank such as raising interest rates to protect the value of the currency the minister said through statutory instrument 142 of 2019 government renamed local currency which has since february 2019 been known as rtgs dollar zimbabwean dollar the new measures form part of ongoing reforms including of the currency by government under its transitional stabilisation programme tsp through the same instrument government also announced the abolishment of the multi currency and restriction of transactions to the domestic unit zimbabwean dollar to avoid redollarisation of the economy when there is no adequate supply of forex that s progress that is what countries do why should zimbabweans remain behind and hang on to the us dollar the us dollar is not our currency the finance minister said share this post like this like loading
mounting no deal brexit fears hit sterling the rising likelihood of no deal brexit has dragged down the pound on the foreign exchanges over the past month as the prospect of a no deal focused boris johnson as prime minister becomes more likely sterling had fallen sharply to less than 1 26 against the us dollar and to about 1 12 against the euro however the us federal reserve coming closer to being forced into cutting interest rates amid fears over a slowing us economy has dampened the strength of the dollar in the past week this has helped to inflate the value of the pound the outgoing head of the european central bank mario draghi also suggested that the eurozone requires more economic stimulus which has sapped the strength of the euro stock markets surge amid stimulus talk mario draghi using one of his final speeches as ecb president to suggest that interest rates in the eurozone may need to be cut further has helped european equities power ahead over the past month increased stimulus can help the stock market to rise as companies borrowing costs are cut investors have also become more positive about the chances of a resolution in the us china trade dispute after a prolonged period of concern over the standoff between washington and beijing although rate cuts from the us fed could suggest a weakening economy the prospect of stimulus from the us central bank has also lifted markets meets forecast car price war and air fares cool inflation uk inflation fell for the first time in four months dropping back down to the target set by the government for consumer prices inflation of 2 fuelled by a price war in the car industry and cheaper air fares economists said the slower annual increase in the cost of an airline ticket in may when compared with april was mainly due to the timing of easter when prices are jacked up around the public holiday the drop in inflation is likely to offer households some much needed respite after inflation spiked after the eu referendum as the drop in the value of the pound pushed up the cost of imports to britain better than forecast brexit stockpiling narrows trade deficit after ballooning as companies rushed to import goods to avoid brexit disruption the uk s trade deficit the shortfall between imports and exports narrowed to 2 7bn in april from 6 1bn in march although suggesting that import and export volumes may be returning to normal economists said the latest figures could indicate that firms in both the uk and on the continent now have unusually high levels of inventory meaning they do not need to trade as much as would normally be the case export demand has also suffered in recent months amid a broader slowdown in the global economy due to the us china trade dispute worse than forecast business surveys paint weak growth picture surveys of business activity used as early warning signals for the british economy by the bank of england and the treasury suggested that uk economic growth remained weak last month the latest snapshot from ihs markit and the chartered institute of procurement and supply showed that service sector activity which accounts for four fifths of the economy strengthened in may despite manufacturing and construction slumping into contraction amid heightened levels of uncertainty over brexit the ihs markit cips services purchasing managers rose to a three month high of 51 from 50 4 in april following a rise in domestic orders a figure above 50 indicates growth still economists warned the pattern of growth remained close to stalling point better than forecast jobs growth slows amid brexit uncertainty after months of employers appearing to shrug off brexit concerns jobs growth slowed in the three months to april employment in britain increased by 32 000 to reach a record high of 32 75m according to the ons significantly down on the 99 000 jobs added to the workforce in march driven by rising self employment and women entering work economists said the weak gains suggested that companies were becoming jittery about brexit the jobless rate has however remained at the lowest level since the mid 1970s while annual growth in average weekly wages increased to 3 4 up from 3 3 in march total average pay including bonuses rose by 3 1 down from 3 3 in march but beating economists forecasts for growth of 3 worse than forecast cold weather in may damages retail sales an unseasonably cold may prompted a sharp decline in summer clothing sales last month raising fears over the strength of the economy as consumers reined in their spending after months of appearing to shrug off brexit concerns retail sales fell by 0 5 month on month the biggest decline in spending this year annual sales growth was 2 3 worse than forecast by city economists the ons said cold weather led to clothing sales dropping by 4 5 from a month earlier while economists suggested a rise in political turmoil could have also discouraged some consumers from spending money on bigger ticket items falling corporation tax revenue hits finances falling corporation tax receipts damaged the health of the public finances in may which in turn fueled a rise in government borrowing public sector net borrowing widened to 5 1bn about 1bn more than may 2018 and 1bn more than forecast by city economists it comes as tax and spending decisions are likely to be given to a new chancellor after the conservative leadership race philip hammond widely expected to be replaced has advised the next prime minister to be prudent as brexit could damage the health of the public finances however most of the hopefuls vying to replace theresa may promised tax cuts and spending increases brexit clouds fade for housing market the brexit uncertainty serving as a brake on the housing market appeared to ease last month as a survey of chartered surveyors showed that prices picked up on relief that the uk hadn t crashed out of the eu without a deal this spring a gauge of house prices from the royal institution of chartered surveyors which shows the difference between members reporting price rises and falls improved to 10 from 22 in april although the strongest reading since october analysts warned that concern over brexit was still holding back some buyers and sellers and another thing we ve learned this month brexit stockpiling set to fuel economic slowdown after fuelling an upswing in economic growth earlier this year the stockpiling rush ahead of the original brexit deadline is poised to drag on the economy over coming months uk firms face renewed risks around how to plan for no deal after the delay until the autumn some firms are likely to run down their stocks rather than place new orders hitting growth according to the bank of england as it slashed its forecast for the second quarter to zero from a previous rate of 0 2 the bank s network of regional agents believes about a tenth will scale back their plans while others will maintain theirs or ramp them up ahead of the autumn although boris johnson has urged britain to do more planning for no deal brexit most firms say they are ready as they can be according to the bank however the lack of clarity limits the extent to which they can be fully ready source the guardian
why facebook may pose a greater financial danger than wall street payments can happen cheaply and easily without banks or credit card companies as has already been demonstrated not in the united states but in china unlike in the u s where numerous firms feast on fees from handling and processing payments in china most money flows through mobile phones nearly for free in 2018 these cashless payments totaled a whopping 41 5 trillion and 90 were through alipay and wechat pay a pair of digital ecosystems that blend social media commerce and banking according to a 2018 article in bloomberg titled why china s payment apps give u s bankers nightmares the nightmare for the u s financial industry is that a technology company whether from china or a homegrown juggernaut such as amazon com inc or facebook inc replicates the success of alipay and wechat in america the stakes are enormous potentially carving away billions of dollars in annual revenue from major banks and other firms that threat may now be materializing on june 18 facebook unveiled a white paper outlining ambitious plans to create a new global cryptocurrency called libra to be launched in 2020 facebook reportedly has high hopes that libra will become the foundation for a new financial system free of control by wall street power brokers and central banks but apparently libra will not be competing with visa or mastercard in fact the libra association lists those two giants among its 28 soon to be founding members others include paypal stripe uber lyft and ebay facebook has reportedly courted dozens of financial institutions and other tech companies to join the libra association an independent foundation that will contribute capital and help govern the digital currency entry barriers are high with each founding member paying a minimum of 10 million to join this gives them one vote or 1 of the total vote whichever is larger in the libra association council members are also entitled to a share proportionate to their investment of the dividends earned from interest on the libra reserve the money that users will pay to acquire the libra currency needless to say all of this has raised some eyebrows among both financial analysts and crypto activists a zero hedge commentator calls libra facebook s crypto trojan rabbit an article in the financial times alphaville calls it blockchain but without the blocks or chain economist nouriel roubini concurs tweeting another zero hedge writer calls libra the dollar s killer app which threatens not only the power of central banks but also the government s money monopoly itself from frying pan to fire to the crypto anarchist community usurping the power of central banks and governments may sound like a good thing but handing global power to the corporate controlled libra association could be a greater nightmare so argues facebook co founder chris hughes who writes in the financial times this currency would insert a powerful new corporate layer of monetary control between central banks and individuals inevitably these companies will put their private interests profits and influence ahead of public ones the libra association s goals specifically say that will encourage decentralised forms of governance in other words libra will disrupt and weaken nation states by enabling people to move out of unstable local currencies and into a currency denominated in dollars and euros and managed by corporations what libra backers are calling decentralisation is in truth a shift of power from developing world central banks toward multinational corporations and the us federal reserve and the european central bank power will shift to the fed and ecb because the dollar and the euro will squeeze out weaker currencies in developing countries as seen recently in greece the result will be to cause their governments to lose control of their currencies and their economies pros and cons caitlin long co founder of the wyoming blockchain coalition recently agreed that libra was a trojan horse but predicted it would have some beneficial effects for one she thought it would impose discipline on the u s banking system by leading to populist calls to repeal its corporate subsidies the fed is now paying its member banks 2 35 in risk free interest on their excess reserves which this year is projected to total 36 billion of corporate welfare to u s banks about half the sum spent on the u s food stamp program if facebook parks its entire u s dollar balance at the federal reserve through one of its bank partners it could earn the same rate but long predicted that facebook would have to pay interest to libra users to avoid a chorus of critics who would loudly publicize how much money facebook and its partners were pocketing from the interest on the money users traded for their libra currency but that was before the libra white paper came out it reveals the profits will indeed be divvied among facebook s libra partners rather than shared with users at one time we earned interest on our deposits in government insured banks with libra we will get no interest on our money which will be entrusted to uninsured crypto exchanges which are coming under increasing regulatory pressure due to lack of transparency and operational irregularities united kingdom economics professor alistair milne points to another problem with the libra cryptocurrency unlike bitcoin it will be a stablecoin whose value will be tied to a basket of fiat currencies and short term government securities that means it will need the backing of real money to maintain its fixed price if reserves do not cover withdrawals who will be responsible for compensating libra holders ideally milne writes reserves would be held with the central bank but central banks will be reluctant to support a private currency long also predicts that facebook s cryptocurrency will be a huge honeypot of data for government officials since every transaction will be traceable but other reviewers see this as libra s most fatal flaw facebook has been called big brother the ultimate government surveillance tool conspiracy theorists link it to the cia and the u s department of defense facebook has already demonstrated that it is an untrustworthy manager of personal data how then can we trust it with our money why use a cryptocurrency at all why has facebook chosen to use a cryptocurrency rather than following wechat and alipay in doing a global payments network in the traditional way yan meng vice president of the chinese software developer network says facebook s fragmented user base across the world leaves it with no better choice than to borrow ideas from blockchain and cryptocurrency facebook just can t do a global payments network via traditional methods which require applying for a license and preparing foreign exchange reserves with local banking one market after another meng said the advantage of wechat and alipay is they have already gained a significant number of users from just one giant economy that accounts for 20 percent of the world s population they have no need to establish their own digital currencies which they still regard as too risky meng suspects that facebook s long term ambition is to become a stateless central bank that uses libra as a base currency he writes with sufficient incentives nodes of facebook s libra network would represent facebook to push for utility in various countries for its 2 7 billion users in business investment trade and financial services which would help complete a full digital economy empire the question is whether regulators will allow that sort of competition with the central banking system immediately after facebook released its libra cryptocurrency plan financial regulators in europe voiced concerns over the potential danger of facebook running a shadow bank maxine waters who heads the financial services committee for the u s house of representatives asked facebook to halt its development of libra until hearings could be held she said this is like starting a bank without having to go through any steps to do it we can t allow facebook to go to switzerland and begin to compete with the dollar without having any regulatory regime that s dealing with them a stateless private central bank or a publicly accountable one facebook may be competing with more than the dollar jennifer grygiel assistant professor of communications at syracuse university writes seems that the company is not seeking to compete with bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies rather facebook is looking to replace the existing global financial system with an all new setup with libra at its center at least at the moment the libra is being designed as a form of electronic money linked to many national currencies that has raised fears that libra might someday be recognized as a sovereign currency with facebook acting as a shadow bank that could compete with the central banks of countries around the world long thinks bitcoin rather than libra will come out the winner in all this but bitcoin s blockchain model is too slow expensive and energy intensive to replace fiat currency as a medium of exchange on a national scale as josh constine writes on techcrunch xisting cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum weren t properly engineered to scale to be a medium of exchange their unanchored price was susceptible to huge and unpredictable swings making it tough for merchants to accept as payment and cryptocurrencies miss out on much of their potential beyond speculation unless there are enough places that will take them instead of dollars but with facebook s relationship with 7 million advertisers and 90 million small businesses plus its user experience prowess it was well poised to tackle this juggernaut of a problem for libra to scale as a national medium of exchange its governance had to be centralized rather than distributed but libra s governing body is not the sort of global controller we want jennifer grygiel writes facebook ceo mark zuckerberg is declaring that he wants facebook to become a virtual nation populated by users powered by a self contained economy and headed by a ceo zuckerberg himself who is not even accountable to his shareholders in many ways the company that mark zuckerberg is building is beginning to look more like a roman empire now with its own central bank and currency than a corporation the only problem is that this new nation like platform is a controlled company and is run more like a dictatorship than a sovereign country with democratically elected leaders a currency intended for trade on a national let alone international scale needs to be not only centralized but democratized responding to the will of the people and their elected leaders rather than bypassing the existing central banking structure as facebook plans to do several groups of economists are proposing a more egalitarian solution nationalizing and democratizing the central bank by opening its deposit window to everyone as explored in my latest book banking on the people democratizing money in the digital age these proposals could allow us all to get 2 35 on our deposits while eliminating bank runs and banking crises since the central bank cannot run out of funds profits from the public medium of exchange need to return to the public rather than enriching an unaccountable corporate controlled facebook trojan horse ellen brown developed her research skills as an attorney practicing

india s foreign exchange reserves soared to a new record high of usd 426 416 billion in the week to june 21 surging a whopping usd 4 215 billion boosted by higher foreign portfolio investments and a stable rupee the previous high was usd 426 028 billion in the week to april 13 2018 since then it had been fluctuating and had fallen by over usd 35 billion as the monetary authority had been heavily intervening in the market to salvage the rupee which was the worst performing currency in asia throughout 2018 shy of usd 427 billion the reserves can take care of imports for almost 10 months according to market experts forex reserves are one of the key revenue earning sources for the central bank which invests the money in foreign government bonds and also with the imf and other secure investment class a portion of it is used to shore up the gold reserves as well which after decades the rbi had increased by over 8 tonnes last fiscal for decades the american government securities have the single largest investment class for the rbi despite it being one of the lowest yielding investments but for the fact that the us government has the most secure credit profile as of end may of the total forex reserves over usd 157 billion were invested in us gilts as per the latest us fed data in the reporting week the reserves soared usd 4 215 billion while in the previous reporting week ending june 14 it had declined by usd 1 358 billion to usd 422 2 billion higher forex reserves are must for a fast growing economy like india with higher imports and lower export earnings earlier in the day the central bank said the country is driven by higher imports mostly by crude oil whose prices spiked during the reporting week due to the iran us diplomatic row the fy 19 cad rose to 2 1 per cent of gdp or usd 57 2 billion as against 1 8 per cent in the previous year but for the march quarter it more than halved to 0 7 per cent from 1 8 per cent the central bank said during june till 23 overseas investors had pumped in a net of rs 10 312 crore into the domestic capital markets this has helped steady the rupee on one hand and also boosted the reserves kitty during the month though the debt segment accounted for the lion s share equity investments slowed down on account of rising geopolitical tensions between iran and the us coupled with trade conflict according to the experts foreign portfolio investors have been net buyers for the previous four consecutive months they invested a net rs 9 031 15 crore in may rs 16 093 crore in april rs 45 981 crore in march and rs 11 182 crore in february both equity and debt the us dollar mobilised through the two dollar rupee buy sell swaps of usd 5 billion each conducted by the reserve bank in march and april also aided the forex reserves in the week to june 28 the foreign currency assets the major component of the overall foreign exchange reserves increased usd 4 202 billion to usd 398 649 billion expressed in dollar terms foreign currency assets include the effect of appreciation depreciation of non us units like the euro pound and yen held in the reserves gold reserves remained unchanged at usd 22 958 billion according to the rbi data special drawing rights with the international monetary fund increased by usd 4 2 million to usd 1 453 billion the country s reserve position with the fund also rose by usd 9 6 million to usd 3 354 billion

to president donald trump and any other group of 20 chief thinking about waging a currency war it s basically impossible to win that s partly because they don t really happen in practice if they did everybody would lose because everyone would play the surest way to affect the relative value of an exchange rate is through nudging interest rates up or down these days monetary policy among most major economies is so aligned that any one country would be hard pressed to notch any kind of victory for very long failing to grasp this risks misunderstanding how interconnected global capital flows and commerce have become regardless of spats about tariffs and talk of a technological cold war between the us and china the term currency wars was popularised by former brazilian finance minister guido mantega in 2010 it captured a global anxiety that gathered pace in the aftermath of the financial crisis when the world s biggest central banks pumped billions of dollars into the economy through quantitative easing the concept has been in remission over the past few years as monetary policy started returning to normal leave it to trump to revive it over the course of his presidency trump has railed against what he sees as the dollar s strength to his credit a model by the international monetary fund suggests the dollar is overvalued by 8 to 16 this criticism has only been compounded by his complaints that the federal reserve isn t cutting rates a move that tends to make the dollar less attractive to this end trump slammed european central bank president mario draghi for flagging rate cuts which could weaken the euro relative to the dollar the president then appeared to fantasise about hiring him to replace fed chairman jerome powell tweeting mario draghi just announced more stimulus could come which immediately dropped the euro against the dollar making it unfairly easier for them to compete against the usa they have been getting away with this for years along with china and others trump s condemnation of powell obscures the fact that most central banks have tilted toward easing because economic circumstances risks to growth and benign inflation warrant it trump will get his cut economists predict as soon as next month but rate reductions are on the menu around the world for much the same reasons when it comes to monetary policy differences are largely matters of degree not kind that s not to say that weaker exchange rates don t have their benefits or aren t a byproduct of rate cuts but it s important to understand that currency management is rarely if ever the sole motivation exchange rates are an important channel through which easing stimulates growth reserve bank of australia governor philip lowe said this week but if everyone is easing there is no exchange rate channel he told the crawford leadership forum at the australian national university in which i participated we trade with one another we don t trade with mars so if everyone s easing the effect that we get from exchange rate depreciation via the transmission mechanism isn t there as far fetched it may seem all of trump s talk about currency manipulation has serious people considering the prospect that the us could directly and unilaterally sell dollars in the market a practice mothballed years ago direct interventions only tend to work when allies cooperate to achieve common aims in 2000 the world s major central banks bought euros to boost the common currency which was floundering in its infant stage a similar team intervened to stem the yen s surge after japan s 2011 tsunami and its slide during a banking crisis in 1998 each was broadly successful in the modern era interventions have also helped emerging markets stabilise their currencies bank of america noted in a report this week it is hard to conceive europe or japan going along with a trump tantrum that serves no goal other than making the dollar cheaper against the euro yen or british pound if trump s target is china the rest of the g 7 have zero interest in being seen to gang up against beijing solo maneuvers don t stand much of a chance of fundamentally altering a currency s trajectory or defying monetary policy logic trump would do well to bear all this in mind there s no commerce on mars this column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board of bloomberg lp and its owners
a notable outcome of the global crisis has been the search for yields by oecd investors manifested in their growing demand for emerging markets emes debt the quantitative easing qe policies adopted by the us and the euro area in the aftermath of the global crisis induced a sharp decline of interest rates and risk premia propagating yield chasing by institutional investors thereby increasing the demand for emes hard and local currency sovereign debt these developments mitigated the original sin concerns identified by eichengreen et al 2007 the inability of most emes to borrow abroad in their currency the resultant rise of the external debt of emes led to an unprecedented increase in their debt gdp bringing to the fore concerns about growing debt overhang and fragility including the possibility of fiscal dominance this possibility is the case when growing debt gdp constrains the conduct of monetary policy inducing the central bank to pay increasing attention to reducing the costs of serving the public debt and county s external debt blanchard 2004 1 in a recent paper ahmed et al 2019 we investigate fiscal dominance channels with a particular focus on emes and developing countries before and after the global crisis a clear example of a fiscal dominance challenge is inflation targeting it regimes in countries with sizeable hard currency external debt gdp possibly such as turkey in recent years and a fair share of latin american economies in past decades their policymakers are exposed to a growing fear of floating calvo and reinhart 2002 specifically real exchange rate depreciation increases the costs of serving their hard currency external debt by the debt gdp times the depreciation rate the cost measured as a fraction of the country s gdp this condition in turn may induce the central bank to put a higher weight on stabilising the real exchange rate while the original inflation targeting and taylor s rule ignored the real exchange rate as a policy goal in oecd countries the research dealing with emes emphasises it aizenman et al 2011 ghosh et al 2016 2 the de jure it classifications are taken from the imf there are 23 it de jure targeters in our sample of which 18 adopted it by 2002 see figure 1 3 in total our dataset is composed of 29 countries 18 of which are classified as emes according to imf weo classification the remaining are developed market economies dmes we extend the specification of aizenman et al 2011 into a generalised taylor rule reaction function where the monetary authority sets the nominal short term interest rate based on the output gap and the inflation deviation from the target inflation rate and other variables of potential interest a lagged interest rate variable captures the policymaker s wish to smooth the interest rate the interest rate is possibly affected by additional variables some dealing with real exchange rate concerns and exchange rate policy the real exchange rate international reserves and others with fiscal dominance issues total public debt gdp foreign currency denominated public debt gdp and the currency composition of public debt figure 1 adoption of inflation targeting de jure among dmes external variables show significant contrasts in importance under it and non it regimes for dmes interest rates are positively associated with real exchange rate reer appreciation under the it regime while the coefficient on the reer changes is negative and mostly insignificant under non it regimes among non it dmes a reduction of international reserves is associated with a significant increase in the policy rate consistent with the fear of floating where the policy rate and international reserves serve as tools for exchange rate stabilisation in contrast dmes under it regimes respond about half as aggressively as the non it group in terms of easing tightening monetary policy in response to international reserve inflows outflows in line with possible fiscal dominance in developed countries under it regimes we find negative effects of public debt on interest rates unlike among non it dmes the sensitivity to fiscal space under it suggests debt matters for monetary policy the commitment to targeting inflation appears to loosen with rising debt levels comparing the results for emes under it and non it regimes we find that the public debt gdp ratio does not appear informative in the case of emes whether under an it or non it regime interest rate policy in emes under it is significantly smoother than under non it regimes unlike dmes both it and non it regimes see significant importance put on inflation rates for interest rate setting 4 international reserves and real exchange rate changes play a vital role in policy rate setting among non it emes but not among emes under the it regime hence the interaction of managing international reserves and exchange rate stability must be taken jointly in the determination of policy rates under non it regimes in the case of emes under non it regimes we also find that a foreign denominated public debt gdp ratio has a signficiant negative effect on policy rates possible evidence of fiscal dominance while the composition of public debt matters too as larger proportions of debt denominated in the foreign currency are associated with higher interest rates possibly a risk premium effect the interest rate effect evidenced among emes following non it regimes is therefore non linear and depends on both debt composition and the total hard currency debt gdp ratio thus far we have employed a de jure method of monetary regime classification and uncovered mixed evidence of fiscal dominance across the sample however many countries implicitly follow an it rule without a public announcement by taking a de facto approach to monetary regime classification we aim to circumvent this issue and provide an additional set of results to complement those from the previous section our de facto approach involves classifying countries by the volatility of their nominal effective exchange rate neer figure 2 shows sorted quarterly neer return volatility by country the idea is that countries with low exchange rate volatility are more likely to follow a de facto exchange rate targeting rule analogously countries with high exchange rate volatility are de facto currency floaters which suggests that such countries target an alternative nominal anchor the interest rate to control inflation we first separate the sample into dmes and emes the second step is to then sort countries within each group into three quantiles based on their exchange rate volatility this yields a low medium and high volatility bin of countries for both dmes and emes 5 figure 2 countires by neer volatility note emes in grey among dmes the effect of the public debt gdp ratio on interest rates is more negative for higher volatility bins with statistically significant coefficients among bin 2 and 3 but insignificant in the low volatility bin bin 1 6 it appears monetary policy is most constrained by debt positions among de facto inflation targeters or countries lying in bin 3 for these high neer volatility dmes larger public debt gdp ratios tend to suppress interest rates and the effect is statistically significant public debt gdp ratios are insignificant among low neer volatility dmes in contrast the low volatility group has a coefficient on public debt gdp which is statistically indifferent from zero for the emes the countries are sorted into three bins with bin 1 3 containing emes with the lowest highest neer volatility over the sample period while we do observe coefficients on inflation monotonically increasing with neer volatility we don t observe similar patterns with the gdp gap 7 public debt gdp and fx public debt public debt ratios having positive coefficients can be interpreted as bearing risk premium effects possible fiscal dominance effects of foreign currency denominated debt gdp are reflected in its negative coefficient hence offsetting the risk premium effect as the level of hard currency debt rises the significant coefficients across these debt variables reflect a non linear relationship between foreign currency denominated debt and monetary policy among this set of emes as an increase in the hard currency debt gdp ratio is associated with lower policy interest rates while hard currency public debt public debt and public debt gdp ratios are associated with higher policy rates 8 to summarise under our simple de facto classification we find evidence of possible fiscal dominance among both dmes and emes as monetary policy is constrained by fiscal space or lack thereof among dmes total public debt gdp is associated with lower policy rates on average and the effect size is larger for high exchange rate volatility countries the de facto inflation targeters among emes the channel is more nuanced the fiscal dominance effect transmits through the level of foreign denominated debt and the impacts on interest rates are non linear as they also depend on the public debt gdp ratio and the composition of public debt which are both impacted by the level of foreign currency denominated debt 9 the de facto analysis bears some similarities with the de jure analysis while also highlighting key differences in particular among emes our de facto analysis highlights that interest rates under it may be more sensitive to the fiscal position of the country in contrast ignoring the de facto analysis and solely referencing the de jure classification would find that emes under non it regimes are more susceptible to fiscal dominance in particular commodity countries show the strongest evidence of debt levels influencing policy

endnotes the distinction between fiscal and monetary dominance regimes is due to sargent and wallace 1981 long period of large fiscal deficits and high public debt to gdp ratios raises the concerns of growing fiscal dominance by heightening the links between fiscal policy monetary policy and government debt management this may be the case when higher policy interest rates or depreciating currencies raise concerns about debt sustainability limiting monetary independence possible manifestations of these concerns include the fear of floating fiscal pressure to mitigate rises of policy interest rates financial repression and the like exchange rate targeting i e exchange rate stabilisation may be accomplished in a hybrid it regime by putting a higher policy weight on stabilising the real exchange rate possibly by proactive management of sizable buffers of international reserves and sovereign wealth funds russia and other commodity countries provide vivid examples of such a policy before and after the crisis hoarding internal reserves at times of improving terms of trade thereby mitigating the real appreciation associated with higher oil prices see aizenman and jinjarak 2019 while the us began explicit it in 2012 we rely on the fact that the monetary authority has implicitly targeted inflation since 1999 see goodfriend 2003 and rose 2007 the aggressive response to combat inflationary pressures in emes could result from several explanations in emes where the expected inflation is not well anchored risks of accelerated inflation leading to out of control inflationary processes and capital flight warrant the aggressive interest rate responses to inflation observed among emes compared to their dme counterparts in the presence of significant foreign currency balance sheet exposure aggressive interest rate responses can additionally stabilise financial conditions via valuation effects and this in turn can help reduce the risk of a vicious cycle turning into a financial crisis among dmes bin 1 and 2 the low and mid volatility neer bins are comprised of four countries each the low volatility bin include hong kong singapore switzerland and the us while the medium volatility is composed of canada norway sweden and the uk the high volatility bin contains three countries australia japan and new zealand notably australia and new zealand are commodity intensive dmes the three bins for emes each contain six countries the low volatility bin contains china czech republic india israel malaysia and thailand bin 2 for medium volatility includes chile hungary indonesia korea mexico and poland the high neer volatility bin is composed mostly of commodity countries argentina brazil colombia russia south africa and turkey with de facto groups in hand we estimate the full taylor rule regression model which includes public debt variables the negative association between exchange rates and interest rates in bin 1 may be due to the concentration of exchange rate targeters hong kong singapore and switzerland all have histories of intervening via policy to stabilise the currency bin 2 containing canada and norway which are oil exporting countries and are more likely to see exchange rate appreciation with a rise in commodity prices therefore a positive interest rate response to currency appreciation may be an attempt to curb future inflation and overheating related to a positive terms of trade shock while the coefficient on reer is insignificant for bin 3 we do find a significant interest rate response to changes in international reserves the negative effect suggests easing monetary policy in response to inflows of international reserves upon inspecting the countries within each bin the pattern in inflation coefficients is consistent with the country characteristics across bins bin 1 contains countries that are mostly manufacturing based with anchored inflation with limited need for neer changes bin 2 is of a mixed composition with greater exposure to terms of trade shocks and with lesser anchored inflation while in bin 3 the high volatility bin tend to be countries with governance challenges with a history of inflation and limited anchoring thereby constraining reactions dealing with output see vegh et al 2017 this view is supported by the fact that both median foreign currency denominated debt levels and inflation rates are highest among bin 3 and lowest among bin 1 a 1 rise in quarterly inflation corresponds with a 4 quarter interest rate increase of 42 110 200 basis points for the low medium and high neer volatility bins this finding is consistent with those countries following de facto it although these responses are considerably larger than those of de facto it dmes one explanation for this may be the additional risk premium emes require to incorporate into their policy rates when battling higher inflation rates this scenario can be related to the relatively weaker anchoring of inflation expectations in emes compared to dmes warranting both more aggressive responses by the monetary authority and higher risk premia demanded by investors facing hyperinflationary risks gdp gaps enter statistically significant among bin 1 and 2 coefficients of 0 018 and 0 100 while bin 3 has an insignificant coefficient estimate bin 2 the set of emes bearing relatively high terms of trade exposure sensibly puts more importance on output gap fluctuations when setting monetary policy compared to the other subgroups of emerging markets changes in the reer enter as highly significant among high volatility emes but not bin 1 or 2 under de jure it classifications both the real exchange rate and international reserves entered significantly for emes under non it regimes it s interesting to note that in contrast the de facto analysis paints a different picture we find that de facto inflation targeters bin 3 respond strongly to exchange rate depreciation compared to non it bin 1 foreign currency denominated debt enters significantly and negatively across all bins and is increasing in exchange rate volatility with a large increase from bin 2 to bin 3 controls for total public debt gdp and the proportion of public debt denominated in foreign currency enter significantly and positively for bin 3 the high volatility subgroup of emes these results closely resemble those of the non it eme group under the de jure classification however when we classify based on a simple de facto rule like binning by exchange rate volatility those more likely to act as inflation targeters appear to have monetary policy more constrained by fiscal factors to illustrate as the composition of total public debt approaches 100 hard currency the fiscal dominance effect tends to dominate any risk premium effect on the interest rate under this scenario a 1 increase in the hard currency debt gdp ratio would also increase the total public debt gdp ratio by 1 because the coefficient estimates on foreign currency debt are larger than that on total public debt in absolute value the net effect on the interest rate will be negative for bin 3 interest rates would be 55 basis points lower bins 1 and 2 have statistically significant estimates on foreign currency debt gdp but not on controls for total public debt or debt composition hence the effect is relatively linear for these countries a 1 transitory increase in the hard currency debt gdp ratio corresponds with interest rates roughly 65 basis points lower over a 4 quarter period for both bins 170 basis points lower from a permanent increase under the limiting case of 100 of public debt is foreign currency denominated interest rate responses are quite similar across eme bins after considering bin 3 s risk premium offset fiscal dominance and risk premium effects are possible interpretations of our results thereby more data and a longer sampling period would be useful to test these interpretations thoroughly debt maturity profile the extent and effectiveness of macro prudential capital controls more detailed data on local currency public and private debt would allow sharper identification of the forces at work these issues are left for future research within emes there is large heterogeneity across economies in terms of their reliance on key commodities to pin down drivers of fiscal dominance across emes we further split our sample into two subgroups countries that either are or are not commodity intensive a country is defined as commodity intensive if at least 25 of exports are in commodities we compile our list of commodity intensive emes argentina brazil chile colombia indonesia mexico russia and south africa we find that it is those that are commodity intensive that show the strongest evidence of debt levels influencing policy interest rates

the zimbabwean government recently did the unfathomable at least according to social media pundits some civil society organisations unions and influential urbanites it arbitrarily and abruptly re introduced a local currency for all domestic financial transactions at least at law guest column takura zhangazha the zimbabwean government recently did the unfathomable at least according to social media pundits some civil society organisations unions and influential urbanites it arbitrarily and abruptly re introduced a local currency for all domestic financial transactions at least at law as expected there was an immediate outburst of anger on social media in press conferences statements and i am pretty sure in the near future in anticipated or provisionally announced forms of physical protests all of which can easily be attributed to the general mistrust of the government s monetary policy as awkward as it sounds the lack of trust in any form of national currency the origins of which appear with the massive inflation that coincided with the global financial crisis in 2007 8 lasted in zimbabwe at least until the introduction of a multi currency regime just before the formation of a unity government in 2009 in this we had relatively a liberal use of the united states dollar us the south african rand and a host of other not so readily available currencies this led to the stabilisation of inflation albeit at great cost to our ability to retain the global value of the us in tandem with developments in the global financial markets while i am not aware of any economic books that were written about the multi currency by 2015 it became almost unsustainable to rely on these multi currencies we had begun purchasing them from their respective central banks so the government introduced the relatively unpopular but utilitarian bond coin in order to deal with challenges of transactions by retailers it was pegged at 1 1 with the popular us the then government went a step further and introduced bond notes almost a year later and suspicion was heightened that it was about to re introduce a full fledged currency again the bond note like its predecessor the coin was pegged at the same value as the us suspicions were abound but both forms of currency were utilised widely especially by poor zimbabweans who did not have regular access to the us in between these ambiguities about currencies and suspicions about government a coup that was not a coup happened in 2017 and a disputed but legitimised election occurred in 2018 by the time we got through the heady disputes over presidential election results in early 2019 the government introduced a third version of the local currency called the real time gross settlement rtgs in early 2019 this essentially meant we had a surrogate currency one that would with time set the ground for the introduction of a somewhat formal one depending on our ability to meet the fiscal requirements of global financialised capital that is the imf world bank and afdb in no short while the government introduced a rated multi currency regime it began officially at least with the rtgs trading somehow at 2 5 to the us this was to be the straw that broke the camel s back again in no short time we were at higher official bank rates via the rtgs to the us it did not work as politically planned instead what we had was a quasi free market currency trading system underpinned by state regulation arguments about the capacity of the state to respond to the financial markets quickly abounded acceptable as these were in a neo liberal sense the key questions that emerged were around the sustainability of the same either in relation to imports of goods or just the extractive political economy trying to lure foreign investors now the zimbabwean government has gone the whole hog with the introduction of a new currency the end effect of which is more in keeping with a neo liberal economic policy than it is intended at being populist it is a move designed to satisfy domestic and foreign capital s requirements to do business at a much lower cost all this has been done in the now proven vain hope that there will be a trickle down effect for the creation of jobs as well as that the free market would be able to resolve social and economic challenges faced by the majority poor all of this is done under the mantra of a return to normalcy the knee jerk and for now populist rejection of a local currency in favour of the us is however intriguing in two specific respects the first being the political dimension of a general mistrust of government with a currency whose commodity exchange value is not in the view of the public guaranteed by global capital this public mistrust is also being buttressed by the previous hyper inflationary period 2007 2009 and the stability brought in by the introduction of a multi currency system thereafter this essentially means the general mindset of the urban zimbabwean public is in sync with global capitalism s expectation of an economy that follows its laissez faire rules and despises contextual protectionist economics the only difference being that apart from a currency global capital understands with great sophistry that there are many other ways to bell the cat beyond a multi currency system the latter point being rather ironic because it is also one that finance minister mthuli ncube and his boss president emmerson mnangagwa understand too well hence the general approval of their economic policy by the gatekeepers of global capital namely the world bank and the imf with the added approval of most southern african governments that are implementing similar economic policies the second astounding aspect is that of how zimbabweans now view money and in particular the usd as a commodity in classical marxist terms we have now come to view it more like a fetish or even a deity it has come to mean more than it is in transactional terms its value now transcends what it actually is in reality we are quite literally under the spell of commodity fetishism because it has also become a commodity that has had become a social arbiter of how we relate to each other without really acknowledging it all of this until now when talk of a local currency from government became louder and is now a reality even if an economist of repute were to explain to an educated zimbabwean that money is really imagined they will find great resistance to that universally given notion to conclude it is evident that the introduction of a local currency does not mean there will be economic abundance for all but neither did the retention of a multi currency regime it is therefore imperative that we examine the system behind the monetary policies in whatever form they come and do so at the point of ideology in order to counter it in our case neoliberalism as an ideology and austerity as a strategy are informing the current and previous currency exchange systems and the economic malaise we have had to endure but then again where money or the us becomes a fetish in and of itself it is a hard ask to call on comrades to understand the system more than the deity
rttnews the major u s index futures are currently pointing to a higher opening on friday as traders keep a close eye on developments at the g20 summit in japan early buying interest may be generated in reaction to news that all 18 of the largest banks in the u s passed the federal reserve s annual stress test the fed said it is not objecting to the capital plans of the 18 firms but is requiring the u s division of credit suisse to address limited weaknesses identified from the test financial giants such as goldman sachs gs j p morgan jpm bank of america bac and citigroup c celebrated by announcing dividend increases and share repurchases trading activity may be somewhat subdued however as traders wait for news out of the highly anticipated meeting between president donald trump and chinese president xi jinping on the sidelines of the g20 summit stocks moved mostly higher over the course of the trading session on thursday although the dow ended the day modestly lower amid a steep drop by shares of boeing ba the dow edged down 10 24 points or less than a tenth of a percent to 26 526 58 with a 2 9 percent slump by boeing weighing on the blue chip index boeing came under pressure

came as traders looked ahead to the highly anticipated g20 meeting between trump and xi trump and xi are not expected to come out of the meeting with a finalized trade deal but traders will be looking for signs of progress toward kick starting the stalled negotiations between the two economic superpowers a report from the wall street journal said xi plans to present trump with a set of terms the u s should meet before beijing is ready to settle the trade dispute lifting the ban on the sale of u s technology to chinese telecom giant huawei removing all tariffs and dropping efforts to get china

few things fill a zimbabwean with fear and dread more than the word zimdollar so it was no surprise that the news zimbabwe had declared the rtgs the sole local currency one more step in the country s march towards its own unit was met with shock and horror guest column newzwire few things fill a zimbabwean with fear and dread more than the word zimdollar so it was no surprise that the news zimbabwe had declared the rtgs the sole local currency one more step in the country s march towards its own unit was met with shock and horror in a statutory instrument issued monday finance minister mthuli ncube said the british pound united states dollar south african rand botswana pula and any other foreign currency whatsoever shall no longer be legal tender alongside the zimbabwe dollar in any transactions in zimbabwe here we try and make sense of what ncube has done and what really it is that he is hoping to achieve with this latest move what just happened from monday only the zimbabwe dollar in the form of bond notes or coins or rtgs is legal tender in zimbabwe you can no longer use us dollars rand pula or other foreign currencies to buy and sell locally effectively this is the end of the multi currency regime introduced in 2009 after zimbabwe ditched the zimbabwe dollar in february the central bank introduced the rtgs as a new currency part of measures to tame forex shortages this new order is the latest in a series of measures that ncube has taken since october when he first launched the transitional stabilisation programme launching that programme ncube and his permanent secretary george guvamatanga pledged to take steps towards ending all controls on the exchange rate since then government separated rtgs and usd balances before introducing a new interbank market in february effectively ending the 1 1 parity and allowing a partial float of the rtgs why is government doing this according to bankers the government s plan here is to force holders of us dollars to sell their forex onto the local market this way they seem to believe that demand for us dollars will ease because more and more local goods and services are being priced in us dollars demand for us dollars has also been going up this has meant that the value of the rtgs has fallen sharply as people chased more us dollars one banker told reuters they government are hoping that this will force generators of forex to sell their forex to make domestic transactions and thus create liquidity in the interbank market but the banker adds it depends on other factors it might work if they can support the market with a large injection of liquidity to complement this if they can t well then people will just hold onto their forex even more tightly than before in may guvamatanga said he believed exporters were holding on to close to us 1 billion keeping it away from the formal interbank market last week the international monetary fund s resident representative patrick imam said the central bank should allow the rtgs to float freely allow exporters to sell dollars at the interbank rate rather than surrender them to the central bank and raise interest rates to curb inflation and avoid spontaneous re dollarisation rtgs is trading at around 6 3 to the us dollar on the official interbank market but it is trading at half that value on the black market what does it mean for fcas many fear that the new regulation will lead to the expropriation of their fcas the fcas introduced under changes in october remain unchanged at least according to the notice nothing in section 2 of the regulations shall affect the opening or operation of foreign currency designated accounts otherwise known as nostro fca accounts which shall continue to be designated in the foreign currencies with which they are opened and in which they are operated nor shall section 2 affect the making of foreign payments from such accounts reads the si just how many fcas are there the latest available data from the rbz shows there were 133 633 fcas holding us 674 million at the end of december 31 2018 of the total fca deposit value 97 was held by corporates just over 111 000 depositors mostly individuals held less than us 1 000 is duty still payable in foreign currency import duty on selected goods under statutory instrument 252a of november 2018 will still be in us dollars the notice says nothing in section 2 of the regulations shall affect the requirement to pay in any of the foreign currencies duties of customs in terms of the customs and excise act that are payable on importation of goods specified under that act to be luxury goods or in respect of such goods to pay any import or value added tax in any of the foreign currencies remittances such as money transfers via western union are not covered by the si as at late monday some agencies were freely paying out remittances in usd
it s another action packed week with the pivotal g20 summit that will decide how risk sentiment develops finally upon us elsewhere the reserve bank of australia rba is expected to slash rates again while oil traders will pay close attention to the opec meeting economic data are not in short supply either with the us employment report likely to add the final touches to expectations around how deep the fed will cut in july trump xi meeting at g20 paramount for risk appetite despite being the epicenter of attention for a while now the meeting between the american and chinese leaders hasn t happened yet it s scheduled for saturday thus markets will probably open with gaps on monday traders hope that trump and xi can sort out some of their differences on trade allowing formal negotiations to resume soon on the margin that does seem like the most likely outcome trump wants more talks something made clear by him calling xi recently and china is unlikely to refuse even if the two sides remain far apart on key issues they still have an incentive to portray a positive picture for fear of damaging business sentiment in their respective home economies if they don t should the two leaders indeed agree to restart negotiations stocks would likely be the biggest winner alongside commodity currencies like the aussie and kiwi meanwhile safe havens such as the japanese yen and gold could give back some of their latest gains the risk is that trump feeling he has more negotiating leverage with us stocks back at record highs decides to play more hardball and sticks to demands that xi finds unreasonable in this case stocks could drop while haven assets grind higher us payrolls pmis crucial for how deep the fed will cut in july in the us the week kicks off with the ism manufacturing pmi for june on monday the non manufacturing survey follows on wednesday along with the private adp jobs figures for the same month culminating with the official employment data on friday forecasts point to a solid report with nonfarm payrolls expected at 165k the unemployment rate steady at 3 6 and a slight acceleration in average hourly earnings since these will be among the final major releases before the fed s july policy meeting they will be crucial in setting expectations for that event the fed has essentially locked itself in for a rate cut then the question is whether it will slash rates by a typical 25 basis points bps or whether it will shock markets with a more aggressive 50bps cut barring a major disappointment in incoming data a 50bps move seems a little excessive as even one of the most dovish fomc members james bullard pointed out lately markets still assign a 25 probability for a 50bps cut so the dollar has some room to recover in the next weeks as this is priced out overall though the outlook for the greenback isn t bright the fed has a lot more firepower to ease than other major central banks meaning that the dollar s potential downside in a prolonged global easing cycle would likely be greater than its peers american markets will remain closed on thursday for independence day rba projected to slash rates again both economists and markets believe the rba will cut rates for a second consecutive time when it meets early on tuesday with market pricing assigning a 75 probability for such an action this number jumped lately after governor lowe noted that the latest cut by itself would probably not be enough to support the economy despite recent data not being horrible investors are convinced the rba will act with force perhaps the biggest argument for acting again so soon is the exchange rate if the bank doesn t cut now then the aussie could surge especially if the trade signals from the g20 are optimistic a stronger currency makes it more difficult for inflation to rise so the rba likely wants to avoid that route while the aussie may drop on a potential rate cut much of its broader direction will also depend on trade in other words a lot of rba easing is already priced in and given that the fed is now also ready to loosen along with other major central banks monetary policy is not a clear negative force for the aussie anymore trade may therefore play an even bigger role in driving the currency moving forward governor lowe will speak a few hours after the decision while the nation s retail sales for may are due on thursday opec and allies meet to extend production cuts it will be a pivotal week for the oil market too not only will the g20 outcome shape the demand outlook but the supply picture will also be updated when opec and its allies meet on monday and tuesday the main question is whether these producers will extend their output cuts and if so for how long judging by recent comments from the various energy ministers a 6 month extension seems like a near certainty this implies that for oil prices to rise materially from here the cartel needs to deliver something over and above what markets already expect for instance a one year extension or deeper production cuts or both canadian jobs data on tap as loonie prepares to fly the yen and the franc may have gotten all the attention lately but the loonie has also been shining canadian economic data are solid in contrast to most of the world which puts the bank of canada boc in the odd situation of being almost the only major central bank not preparing to cut rates hence the employment data for june that are due on friday could be the catalyst for even more gains in the loonie if they confirm the narrative that the boc will be an island of neutrality as others ease before that though the oil linked currency will also be sensitive to how the g20 and opec meetings play out uk pmis unlikely to distract markets from brexit the british pound has recovered some ground lately partly due to a more conciliatory tone on brexit by the two candidates aiming to become prime minister and partly due to broad dollar weakness in the economic realm the pmi surveys for june will be released on monday tuesday and wednesday for the respective manufacturing construction and service sectors but as usual the currency will probably respond mainly to politics in that sense all eyes remain on the tory leadership race where boris johnson is leading by a wide margin chinese japanese business surveys to gauge health of global economy in china the pmis for june will be in focus the official surveys will be released over the weekend while the private caixin figures are due early on monday and wednesday for the manufacturing and service sectors respectively admittedly with the trade war escalating recently the risks surrounding these numbers seem tilted towards a decline in such case global risk appetite could take a hit in japan the quarterly tankan survey for q2 is due on monday forecasts point to a drop in business confidence which likely reflects trade worries regardless the yen doesn t typically react to economic data and will therefore take its cue mainly from changes in risk sentiment given its haven status overall the outlook for the japanese currency is improving besides risk aversion making a comeback foreign central banks are also preparing to ease that could continue to narrow the relative rate differentials between japan and the rest of the world making the yen more attractive by comparison
the recent decision by the zimbabwean government to ban local trading in foreign currencies including the us dollar has created uncertainty among traders and investors in the country the reserve bank of zimbabwe announced this week it was reintroducing the zimbabwean dollar a currency it stopped using over a decade ago due to hyperinflation the british pound united states dollar south african rand botswana pula and any other foreign currency whatsoever shall no longer be legal tender alongside the zimbabwe dollar in any transactions in zimbabwe according to a decree from the zimbabwean government mavis chauke a 39 year old single mother of four who runs a shop in downtown harare capital city of zimbabwe is among those who are uncertain if the new currency will work or not i m just waiting to see if the idea will work i have traded my wares in us dollars because i order my goods for sale from neighboring countries like south africa and so i have to change the money i get in order to then buy my wares for sale here chauke told anadolu agency besides selling various items in her small shop in harare chauke said she also trades in foreign currency as money changer she said the business of trading foreign currency on the black market has now become more risky as security personnel hunt them down zimbabwe s many years of economic crisis create high unemployment forcing some people to join the illegal foreign currency business on the streets of harare sink or swim for zimbabwe many informal businesspersons like chauke face zimbabwe s hostile economy at a time the country s inflation rate this year jumped to 97 85 in may from 75 86 in the previous month for chauke the ban of multi currencies like us dollars in zimbabwe triggers memories of the 2008 hyperinflation period when the zimbabwean dollar was rendered worthless before government dumped it in favor of multiple foreign currencies economists have reacted differently to the resurrection of zimbabwe s currency for some it means the country has put the last nail on its coffin of economic demise while for a few others it means well this is a huge gamble and it is sink or swim for zimbabwe if the gamble doesn t work and the zimbabwe dollar suffers a similar fate to its predecessor the consequences will be unimaginable alex magaisa a uk based zimbabwean constitutional law expert said he said if the reintroduced zimbabwean dollar fails to curb inflation then government would have run out of options this was one of the final cards they have thrown it in let s see how the market responds he said kingston gavi an independent economist said the new zimbabwean dollar would arrest the speculation that had sent illegal money changers thriving on the black market now people will change their foreign currency in banks bringing normalcy other independent economists like edie cross former opposition politician of the movement for democratic change mdc views zimbabwe s new currency move as more disastrous i think it s a ridiculous measure the exchange rate will run and this is completely out of sync for heaven s sake this is economic sabotage cross who is also founding member of the mdc the main opposition party in zimbabwe said independent economist gerald hungwe believes the scrapping of multi currencies will create more confusion in the financial sector businesses which had debts in forms of foreign currencies like us dollars could see the cost of servicing those debts rise ban of multi currencies means that all debts accrued in us dollars are now payable in the local currency hungwe told anadolu agency for informal businesspersons here like chauke it is also time for reality check

a currency intended for trade on a national let alone international scale needs to be not only centralized but democratized responding to the will of the people and their elected leaders payments can happen cheaply and easily without banks or credit card companies this has now been demonstrated not in the united states but in china unlike in the us where numerous firms feast on fees from handling and processing payments in china most money flows through mobile phones nearly for free in 2018 these cashless payments totaled a whopping 41 5 trillion and 90 were through alipay and wechat pay a pair of digital ecosystems that blend social media commerce and banking according to a may 2018 article in bloomberg titled why china s payment apps give u s bankers nightmares the nightmare for the u s financial industry is that a technology company whether from china or a homegrown juggernaut such as amazon com inc or facebook inc replicates the success of alipay and wechat in america the stakes are enormous potentially carving away billions of dollars in annual revenue from major banks and other firms that threat may now be materializing on june 18 facebook unveiled a white paper outlining ambitious plans to create a new global cryptocurrency called libra to be launched in 2020 the new york times says facebook has high hopes that libra will become the foundation for a new financial system free of control by wall street power brokers and central banks but apparently libra will not be competing with visa or mastercard in fact the libra association lists those two giants among its 28 soon to be founding members others include paypal stripe uber lyft and ebay facebook has reportedly courted dozens of financial institutions and other tech companies to join the libra association an independent foundation that will contribute capital and help govern the digital currency entry barriers are high with each founding member paying a minimum of 10 million to join this gives them one vote or 1 of the total vote whichever is larger in the libra association council members are also entitled to a share proportionate to their investment of the dividends earned from interest on the libra reserve the money that users will pay to acquire the libra currency all of which has raised some eyebrows both among financial analysts and crypto activists a zero hedge commentator calls libra facebook s crypto trojan rabbit an article in ft s alphaville calls it blockchain but without the blocks or chain economist noriel roubini concurs tweeting it will start as a private permission not trustless centralized oligopolistic members only club so much for calling it blockchain t is blockchain in name only and a monopoly to extract massive seignorage from billions of users a monopoly scam another zero hedge writer calls libra the dollar s killer app which threatens not only the power of central banks but also the government s money monopoly itself from frying pan to fire to the crypto anarchist community usurping the power of central banks and governments may sound like a good thing but handing global power to the corporate controlled libra association could be a greater nightmare so argues facebook co founder chris hughes who writes in the financial times this currency would insert a powerful new corporate layer of monetary control between central banks and individuals inevitably these companies will put their private interests profits and influence ahead of public ones the libra association s goals specifically say that will encourage decentralized forms of governance in other words libra will disrupt and weaken nation states by enabling people to move out of unstable local currencies and into a currency denominated in dollars and euros and managed by corporations what libra backers are calling decentralization is in truth a shift of power from developing world central banks toward multinational corporations and the us federal reserve and the european central bank power will shift to the fed and ecb because the dollar and the euro will squeeze out weaker currencies in developing countries as seen recently in greece the result will be to cause their governments to lose control of their currencies and their economies pros and cons in a june 9 review in forbes caitlin long co founder of the wyoming blockchain coalition agreed that libra was a trojan horse but predicted that it would have some beneficial effects for one she thought it would impose discipline on the us banking system by leading to populist calls to repeal their corporate subsidies the fed is now paying its member banks 2 35 in risk free interest on their excess reserves which this year is projected to total 36 billion of corporate welfare to us banks about half the sum spent on the us food stamp program if facebook parks its entire us dollar balance at the federal reserve through one of its bank partners it could earn the same rate but long predicted that facebook would have to pay interest to libra users to avoid a chorus of critics who would loudly publicize how much money facebook and its partners were pocketing from the interest on the money users traded for their libra currency but that was before the libra white paper came out it reveals that the profits will indeed be divvied among facebook s libra partners rather than shared with users at one time we earned interest on our deposits in government insured banks with libra we will get no interest on our money which will be entrusted to uninsured crypto exchanges which are coming under increasing regulatory pressure due to lack of transparency and operational irregularities uk economics professor alistair milne points to another problem with the libra cryptocurrency unlike bitcoin it will be a stablecoin whose value will be tied to a basket of fiat currencies and short term government securities that means it will need the backing of real money to maintain its fixed price if reserves do not cover withdrawals who will be responsible for compensating libra holders ideally milne writes reserves would be held with the central bank but central banks will be reluctant to support a private currency caitlin long also predicts that facebook s cryptocurrency will be a huge honeypot of data for government officials since every transaction will be traceable but other reviewers see this as libra s most fatal flaw facebook has been called big brother the ultimate government surveillance tool conspiracy theorists link it to the cia and the us department of defense facebook has already demonstrated that it is an untrustworthy manager of personal data how then can we trust it with our money why use a cryptocurrency at all a june 20th coindesk article asks why facebook has chosen to use a cryptocurrency rather than following wechat and alipay in doing a global payments network in the traditional way the article quotes yan meng vice president of the chinese software developer network who says facebook s fragmented user base across the world leaves it with no better choice than to borrow ideas from blockchain and cryptocurrency facebook just can t do a global payments network via traditional methods which require applying for a license and preparing foreign exchange reserves with local banking one market after another said meng the advantage of wechat and alipay is they have already gained a significant number of users from just one giant economy that accounts for 20 percent of the world s population they have no need to establish their own digital currencies which they still regard as too risky meng suspects that facebook s long term ambition is to become a stateless central bank that uses libra as a base currency he wrote in a june 16 article with sufficient incentives nodes of facebook s libra network would represent facebook to push for utility in various countries for its 2 7 billion users in business investment trade and financial services which would help complete a fully digital economy empire the question is whether regulators will allow that sort of competition with the central banking system immediately after facebook released its libra cryptocurrency plan financial regulators in europe voiced concerns over the potential danger of facebook running a shadow bank maxine waters who heads the financial services committee for the us house of representatives asked facebook to halt its development of libra until hearings could be held she said this is like starting a bank without having to go through any steps to do it we can t allow facebook to go to switzerland and begin to compete with the dollar without having any regulatory regime that s dealing with them a stateless private central bank or a publicly accountable one facebook may be competing with more than the dollar jennifer grygiel assistant professor of communications at syracuse university writes seems that the company is not seeking to compete with bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies rather facebook is looking to replace the existing global financial system with an all new setup with libra at its center at least at the moment the libra is being designed as a form of electronic money linked to many national currencies that has raised fears that libra might someday be recognized as a sovereign currency with facebook acting as a shadow bank that could compete with the central banks of countries around the world caitlin long thinks bitcoin rather than libra will come out the winner in all this but bitcoin s blockchain model is too slow expensive and energy intensive to replace fiat currency as a medium of exchange on a national scale as josh constine writes on techcrunch com xisting cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum weren t properly engineered to scale to be a medium of exchange their unanchored price was susceptible to huge and unpredictable swings making it tough for merchants to accept as payment and cryptocurrencies miss out on much of their potential beyond speculation unless there are enough places that will take them instead of dollars but with facebook s relationship with 7 million advertisers and 90 million small businesses plus its user experience prowess it was well poised to tackle this juggernaut of a problem for libra to scale as a national medium of exchange its governance had to be centralized rather than distributed but libra s governing body is not the sort of global controller we want jennifer grygiel writes facebook ceo mark zuckerberg is declaring that he wants facebook to become a virtual nation populated by users powered by a self contained economy and headed by a ceo zuckerberg himself who is not even accountable to his shareholders in many ways the company that mark zuckerberg is building is beginning to look more like a roman empire now with its own central bank and currency than a corporation the only problem is that this new nation like platform is a controlled company and is run more like a dictatorship than a sovereign country with democratically elected leaders a currency intended for trade on a national let alone international scale needs to be not only centralized but democratized responding to the will of the people and their elected leaders rather than bypassing the existing central banking structure as facebook plans to do several groups of economists are proposing a more egalitarian solution nationalizing and democratizing the central bank by opening its deposit window to everyone as explored in my latest book banking on the people democratizing money in the digital age these proposals could allow us all to get 2 35 on our deposits while eliminating bank runs and banking crises since the central bank cannot run out of funds profits from the public medium of exchange need to return to the public rather than enriching an unaccountable corporate controlled facebook trojan horse

slowdown in the banking and insurance sector boj all policy measures should be considered if baseline scenario changes in the summary of opinions at june 19 20 boj meeting it s noted that japan s

for boj to take some kind of policy responses if some changes emerge in the baseline scenario of the outlook for prices and all policy measures including adjustments in short and long term interest rates an acceleration in the pace of expansion in the monetary base and an increase in the amount of assets to be purchased should be deliberated when considering additional easing additionally it s

by k n c has the world witnessed peak democracy is the future one in which open societies with free markets vie for influence in global affairs with authoritarian countries under state capitalism the very questions evoke a nostalgia for a seemingly simpler past for michael o sullivan formerly an investment banker and economist at princeton university it is more useful to consider the future mr o sullivan s book the levelling what s next after globalisation offers a roadmap he sees a multipolar world forming but international institutions unprepared for this he voices worries about a world of low growth and high debt and calls for a world treaty on risk so central banks only resort to measures like quantitative easing under agreed conditions but his most intriguing framing of the issues is his comparison of today s world and 17th century england s putney debates when the practicalities of a rights based democracy were first enunciated by a faction called the levellers which inspired the book s title the world he believes will cleave into leveller countries that hew to rights and freedoms and leviathan ones that are content with state managed growth and fewer liberties as part of the economist s open future initiative we probed mr o sullivan ideas in a short interview below that is an excerpt from his book on the end of globalisation the economist describe what comes after globalisation what does the world you foresee look like mr o sullivan globalisation is already behind us we should say goodbye to it and set our minds on the emerging multipolar world this will be dominated by at least three large regions america the european union and a china centric asia they will increasingly take very different approaches to economic policy liberty warfare technology and society mid sized countries like russia britain australia and japan will struggle to find their place in the world while new coalitions will emerge such as a hanseatic league 2 0 of small advanced states like those of scandinavia and the baltics institutions of the 20th century the world bank the international monetary fund and the world trade organisation will appear increasingly defunct the economist what killed globalisation michael o sullivan at least two things have put paid to globalisation first global economic growth has slowed and as a result the growth has become more financialised debt has increased and there has been more monetary activism that is central banks pumping money into the economy by buying assets such as bonds and in some cases even equities to sustain the international expansion second the side effects or rather the perceived side effects of globalisation are more apparent wealth inequality the dominance of multinationals and the dispersion of global supply chains which have all become hot political issues the economist was the death of globalisation inevitable or could and should it have been prevented mr o sullivan one problematic factor here is that there is no central body or authority to shape globalisation beyond perhaps the world economic forum or maybe the organisation for economic co operation and development in many ways the end of globalisation is marked by the poor and inconclusive response to the global financial crisis in general the response has been to cut the cost of capital and not to tackle the root causes of the crisis as such the world economy will limp on burdened by debt and in hock to easy money from central banks the economist the book s title comes from the levellers during britain s putney debates in the mid 1600s who were they and what can their story teach us today mr o sullivan the levellers are a hidden gem from british history they were a mid 17th century group in england who participated in debates about democracy that took place in a part of london called putney their achievement was crafting an agreement of the people which were a series of manifestos that marked the first popular conceptions of what a constitutional democracy might look like the levellers are interesting for two reasons first in the context of the time their approach was constructive and practical the agreement spells out what people want from those who govern them in a clear and tangible way for example they proposed term limits on political office and that laws regarding indebtedness are applied equally to the rich and poor second they are interesting for the way the movement was countermanded and then snuffed out by the military leader oliver cromwell and the grandees the elites of their day like so many idealistic political start ups the levellers failed this should encourage the growing number of new political parties like change uk and new candidates to be worldy wise in how they approach the process of political reform and change the economist you foresee new international institutions to replace archaic 20th century ones that are suited for a different time how would they work and can countries with such different values ie democratic market based levellers and state managed societies and economies the leviathans really cooperate mr o sullivan a lot is made of the cold war rivalry between communist russia and america and now some want to see a clash of civilizations between america and china the levelling characterises a future where there are at least two approaches to public life the most distinctive approach to nations doing things in their own way will be for what the levellers might call the rights of freeborn men or the idea of the open society the code of the levellers presents a very clear political formula that europeans and americans will recognise for its values though decreasingly in its practice the challenge to this code will come from the rising acceptance of less democratic ways of ordering society in both developed and developing countries a related clash will be the desire of a growing proportion of electorates to have a more open society as economies also open up as the world evolves along the lines of leveller type and leviathan type societies it is possible that in some countries such as russia a leviathan like approach that is order in exchange for reduced democracy and rights will be the accepted way of life in other countries most interestingly china as its economy loses momentum and evolves there may be a growing tension between groups holding the leviathan view supported inevitably by grandees and opposing leveller like groups who favor equality of opportunity and a multiparty system the role and views of women especially in china and of minority groups like the gay community will be pivotal the emergence of a new world order based on large regions and coloured by leveller and leviathan modes of governance echoes several periods in history the challenge in the next few years will be for leviathan oriented nations like china to maintain economic stability so that rising unemployment for instance does not break the leviathan contract equally the challenge in leveller countries will be to maintain open fraternal societies in the face of political and potentially economic volatility good bye to globalisation excerpted from the levelling what s next after globalization by michael o sullivan publicaffairs 2019 it may well be better that those who have grown fond of globalization get over it accept its passing and begin to adjust to a new reality many will resist and like the thirty five foreign policy experts who published an advertisement in the new york times on july 26 2018 under the banner why we should preserve international institutions and order will feel that the existing world order and its institutions should be maintained i disagree globalization at least in the form that people have come to enjoy it is defunct from here the passage away from globalization can take two new forms one dangerous scenario is that we witness the outright end of globalization in much the same manner as the first period of globalization collapsed in 1913 this scenario is a favorite of commentators because it allows them to write about bloody end of the world calamities this is thankfully a low probability outcome and with apologies to the many armchair admirals in the commentariat who for instance talk willfully of a conflict in the south china sea i suggest that a full scale sea battle between china and the united states is unlikely instead the evolution of a new world order a fully multipolar world composed of three perhaps four depending on how india develops large regions that are distinct in the workings of their economies laws cultures and security networks is manifestly underway my sense is that until 2018 multipolarity was a more theoretical concept more something to write about than to witness this is changing quickly trade tensions advances in technologies such as quantum computing and the regulation of technology are just some of the fissures around which the world is splitting into distinct regions multipolarity is gaining traction and will have two broad axes first the poles in the multipolar world have to be large in terms of economic financial and geopolitical power second the essence of multipolarity is not simply that the poles are large and powerful but also that they develop distinct culturally consistent ways of doing things multipolarity where regions do things distinctly and differently is also very different from multilateralism where they do them together china in particular is interesting in the context of the switch from globalization to multipolarity not least because at the 2017 world economic forum the chinese president claimed the mantle of globalization for china china benefited greatly from globalization and its accoutrements e g wto membership and it played a vital role in the supply chain dynamic that drove globalization however trade flows into china increasingly betray a move away from a globalized world and toward a more regionally focused one for instance imf data show that in 2018 compared with 2011 cambodia vietnam laos and malaysia traded more with china and relatively less with the united states these countries together with bangladesh and pakistan have allowed themselves to be enticed by trade and investment based relationships with china and are now in its orbit however china is itself not globalized it is increasingly hard for western companies to do business there on equal terms with chinese companies and the flow of both money and ideas out of and into china respectively is heavily curtailed flow of people is another indicator flows within china are dynamic and are perhaps more managed than before but flows of foreigners into china are miniscule by comparison to other countries and china has only recently established an agency the state immigration administration created at the 2018 party congress to cultivate inward flows so as china has become a major pole it has become less globalized and arguably is contributing to the trend toward deglobalization on a broader scale without picking on individual countries we can measure the extent to which the world is becoming multipolar by examining aggregate trends in trade gdp foreign direct investment government budget size and population all of these are much less concentrated or more dispersed than they used to be and increasingly they are collecting around several poles for example in the five years from 2012 to 2017 total foreign direct investment into australia from china increased at a rate of 21 percent per annum compared to 6 percent from the united states to australia suggesting that asian investment in australia is picking up even if multipolarity is based on the growing dispersion and regionalization of economic power it is also expressed in other ways notably military power political and cyberfreedoms technological sophistication financial sector growth and a greater sense of cultural prerogative and confidence these are not as easily measured as economic multipolarity but some clear strands are emerging to try to synthesize what a pole entails we can point toward several initial factors size of a country s gdp size of its population the existence of an imperial legacy the extent of its regional economic role its military size and sophistication e g absolute spending number of fighter jets and ships its place on the un human development index relative to its region and its participation or not in a regional grouping such as nato or the european union under this schema the european union the united states china and potentially india are poles but japan and russia would not qualify as distinct poles russia for instance scores well on certain aspects of multipolarity e g militarily but in its current state it may never become a true pole in the sense employed here the path toward multipolarity will not be smooth one tension is that since the industrial revolution the world has had an anchor point in terms of the locus and spread of globalization britain in the nineteenth century and the united states in the twentieth century the fact that there are now at least three points of reference introduces a new and possibly uncertain dynamic to world affairs the potential is high for friction misunderstanding and conflict among the increasingly different ways of doing things across the major poles essentially multipolarity means that instead of speaking a common language the major poles speak different policy languages trade based tension is an obvious possibility here another form of tension is the crisis of identity created for countries that are not wholly within one of the poles again japan australia and the united kingdom are the prime examples and the crisis of ambition for countries such as russia that want to be poles but lack the wherewithal to do so convincingly at a more grassroots level the implications of the end of globalization as we know it and the path to multipolarity will become a greater part of the political debate at the margin the flow of people ideas and capital may be less global and more regional and in time could be reinforced by a growing sense of regionalization across the main poles in a negative way a more multipolar world may be the watershed that signals the peak of democracy and potentially the beginning of contests within regions for competing views of democracy institutional strength

while it is not on the official agenda the key issue at the two day g20 summit meeting starting in osaka japan today will be the outcome of talks between us president donald trump and china s president xi jinping the sideline meeting is widely viewed as the last chance to restart trade negotiations that broke down in early may trump accused the chinese side of backtracking on previous commitments and threatened the imposition of tariffs of 25 percent on an additional 300 billion worth of chinese goods together with previous tariffs the new measures would cover virtually all chinese imports into the us the one and a half hour trump xi meeting scheduled for saturday morning will not announce a trade deal there are still wide divergences between the two sides on essential issues but there may be an agreement to resume top level discussions between officials that possibility was raised on monday when the chief chinese trade negotiator vice premier liu he and his american counterpart us trade representative robert lighthizer held a telephone conversation no details of the conversation have emerged china s ministry of commerce issued a brief statement saying it was at the request of the us and involved an exchange of opinions on economic and trade issues the prospect of any agreement has significantly lessened since the talks broke down the issue of an enforcement mechanism remains the us is demanding that it must be allowed to retain tariffs until it determines that china is complying with any agreement china insists that all punitive tariffs have to be removed another sticking point will be the bans imposed by the us that prevent chinese technology company huawei from purchasing components and software from us suppliers a move designed to cripple its global operations a wall street journal report citing a chinese official said china was insisting that the us lift the ban on huawei as part of any agreement in a briefing yesterday a chinese commerce ministry spokesman called on the us to immediately rescind the suppression and sanction measures against huawei and other chinese enterprises any move in that direction is extremely unlikely key sections of the us military and intelligence agencies as well as their spokesmen in both the democratic and republican parties regard the bans as essential on national security grounds to maintain us supremacy in high tech one leading democratic anti china hawk senate minority leader chuck schumer demanded that trump not give in to chinese demands he said the president cannot go soft now and accept a bad deal that falls short of reforming china s rapacious economic policies cyber espionage forced technology transfers and worst of all denial of market access on the republican side senator marco rubio said commerce department officials had told him that trump would not alter the us stance on huawei as part of any trade agreement he told the wall street journal it s not really a trade issue as much as it is first a national security issue and second a wake up call to the us about how we need to have a counter to chinese industrial policy the most likely but by no means certain outcome of the trump xi meeting is an agreement to resume negotiations while trump holds back on the additional tariff measures and possibly reduces the threatened new imposts to 10 percent however to use the rhetoric employed by trump regarding military threats against iran the additional trade war measures against china are cocked and loaded us hearings over the threatened new tariffs involving submissions from affected companies have been completed and the new measures can be imposed rapidly while china is a primary focus of the america first agenda it is by no means the only target in the days leading up to the summit trump lashed out at supposed us allies the president told fox business this week the us japan defence alliance was lopsided if japan were attacked the us would go in and fight world war three but if we are attacked japan doesn t have to help us at all they can watch on a sony television the attack on japan is connected to a recent intervention by japanese prime minister shinzo abe to try to ease tensions over iran trump is seeking to use the g20 to press for international support for stepped up actions and increased sanctions against iran following the us abrogation of the 2015 nuclear treaty signs of washington s pressure on japan were also evident in a draft communiqué from the summit which is being drawn up by japan as the host nation according to a report in the financial times the draft omitted references to global warming and decarbonisation and downplayed the paris climate accord from which the us has withdrawn the report said the omissions were an attempt to placate the us the us is demanding that japan make major concessions on trade backed by a threat to impose a 25 percent tariff on cars and auto parts on national security grounds that threat also hangs over the european union it was pressured into bilateral trade negotiations last july when trump boasted that the possibility of the tariff measures saw european commission president jean claude juncker fly to washington and agree to talks but the negotiations have made little progress because of us insistence that agriculture must be included an issue that the eu maintains is off the table in the lead up to the g20 trump blasted europe on two fronts competition policy and currency valuations this week he denounced eu antitrust commissioner margrethe vestager that followed the launching of an antitrust case against the us chipmaker broadcom accusing it of using contractual restrictions with the makers of tv set top boxes to exclude rivals vestager has also moved against amazon apple and google for abuse of their market dominance and tax avoidance trump told fox business that she hates the united states perhaps worse than any person i ve ever met trump declared what she does to our country she s suing all our companies earlier this month trump took aim at european central bank president mario draghi accusing him of currency manipulation that was after draghi foreshadowed a further easing of monetary policy sending the euro lower against the dollar trump returned to the currency issue in his fox interview he again hit out at the us federal reserve calling its monetary policy insane fed chairman jerome powell was doing a bad job trump declared he has to lower interest rates for us to compete with china if they devalue and we can t we are no longer on a level playing field trump has claimed that if the fed lowered interest rates and resumed quantitative easing wall street s dow index would be 10 000 points higher trump s turn to currency issues indicates that the economic warfare being waged against china and the rest of the world is broadening since the 2008 global financial crisis the g20 has emphasised that currency devaluations must be avoided at all costs now they are being revived by the us president significantly as on the issue of china trump is receiving support from within the democratic party earlier this month democratic presidential candidate elizabeth warren called for a policy of actively managing the us dollar echoing trump she said managing the us currency would promote exports and domestic manufacturing and blamed foreign investors and central banks for having driven up the value of our currency for their own benefit the impact of the intensifying global trade war was highlighted by denmark s a p moller maersk which owns around 20 percent of all container capacity it said the conflict between the us and china may reduce the growth in global container volumes by a third this year one shipping container analyst told the wall street journal the optimism we had just a few weeks ago when we thought a trade deal would be signed between the us and china has evaporated the ongoing breakdown of the post world war ii international economic order was underscored by a report prepared by the world trade organisation for the g20 summit it said the number of trade restricting measures imposed between october 2018 and may 2019 was three and a half times the average since it started to monitor trade policy in 2012

ten democrats faced off thursday in the dramatic second night of the 2020 democratic debate in miami front runner and former vice president joe biden stood center stage alongside high profile candidates including vermont sen bernie sanders california sen kamala harris and south bend ind mayor pete buttigieg the most dramatic moment of the evening was arguably when harris confronted biden about his opposition to a busing plan to integrate segregated schools noting that the issue impacted her personally as a child the showdown came just one night after the debates kicked off with sen elizabeth warren julián castro sen cory booker and others here is a full transcript of the second night of the first 2020 democratic debate sen sanders get the first question on taxes holt and good evening once again welcome to the candidates and our spirited audience here tonight in the arsht center and across america tonight we continue the spirited debate about the future of the country how to tackle our most pressing problems and getting to the heart of the biggest issues in this democratic primary guthrie tonight we are going to talk about healthcare immigration we re also to dive into the economy jobs climate change as well diaz balart as a quick rules of the road before we begin and they may sound familiar 20 candidates cal qualified for this first debate as we said we heard from 10 last night and we will hear from 10 more tonight the breakdown for each night was selected at random the candidates will have 60 seconds to answer 30 seconds for follow ups holt and because of the large field of candidates not every person is going to be able to weigh in on every topic but over the course of the next two hours we will hear from everyone guthrie and we love our audience but we would like to ask them to keep their reactions to a minimum and we are not going to hold back making sure that candidates stick to time so with that business take care taken care of let s get to it and we are going to start today with senator sanders good evening to you you have called for big new government benefits like universal healthcare and free college in a recent interview you said you suspected that americans would be quote delighted to pay more taxes for things like that my question to you is will taxes go up for the middle class in a sanders administration and if so how do you sell that to voters sanders well you are quite right we have a new vision for america and at a time when we have three people in this country owning more wealth than the bottom half of america while 500 000 people are sleeping out on the streets today we think it is time for change real change and by that i mean that healthcare in my view is a human right and we have got to pass a medicare for all single payer system under that system by the way vast majority of the people in this country will be paying significantly less for healthcare than they are right now i believe that education is the future for this country and that is why i believe that we must make public colleges and universities tuition free and eliminate student debt and we do that by placing a tax on wall street every proposal that i have brought forth is fully paid for guthrie senator sanders i will give you 10 seconds just to ask the answer the very direct question will you raise taxes for the middle class in a sanders administration sanders people who have healthcare under medicare for all will have no premiums no deductibles no copayments no out of expe out of pocket expenses yes they will pay more in taxes but less in healthcare for what they get guthrie thank you senator bennet senator sanders guthrie senator senator bennet we re going to get to everybody biden i d like to say biden addresses income inequality guthrie senator biden promise everyone s going to get in here promise sen vice president biden senator sanders as you know has been calling for revolution recently in remarks to a group of wealthy donors as you were speaking about the problem of income inequality in this country you said we shouldn t quote demonize the rich you said nobody has to be punished no one s standard of living would change nothing would fundamentally change what did you mean by that biden what i meant by that is look donald trump thinks wall street built america ordinary middle class americans built america my dad used to have an expression he said joe a job is about a lot more than a paycheck it s about your dignity it s about respect it s being able to look your kid in the eye and say everything s going to be okay too many people who are in the middle class and poor have had the bottom fall out under this proposal what i am saying is that we ve got to be straightforward we have to make sure we understand that to return dignity to the middle class they have to have insurance that is covered and they can afford it they have to make sure that we inaudible situation where there s continuing education and they are able to pay for it and they have to make sure that they are able to breathe air that is is is clean and they they have water that they can drink look donald trump has put us in a horrible situation we do have enormous income inequality and one thing i agree honestly can make massive cuts in the 1 6 trillion in tax loopholes out there and i would be going about eliminating donald trump s tax cuts for the wealthy guthrie vice president biden thank you sen harris on whether candidates should explain how to pay for their proposals senator harris there s a lot of talk in this primary about new government benefits such as student loan cancellation free college healthcare and more do you think that democrats have a responsibility to explain how they will pay for every proposal guthrie they make along those lines harris well let me tell you something i i hear that question but where was that question when the republicans and donald trump passed a tax bill that that benefits the top 1 percent and the biggest corporations in the this country contributing at least a 1 trillion to the debt of america which middle class families will pay for one way or another working families need support and need to be lifted up and frankly this economy is not working or working people for too long the rules have been written in the favor of the people who have the most and not in favor of the people who work the most which why i am proposing that we change the tax code so for every family that is making less than 100 000 year they will receive a tax credit that they can collect up to 500 a month which will make all the difference between those families being able to get through the end of the month with dignity and was support or not and on day one i will repeal that tax bill that benefits the top 1 percent and the biggest corporations in america candidates are asked about socialism guthrie senator harris thank you governor hickenlooper let me get you in on this you ve warned that democrats will lose in 2020 if they embrace socialism as you put it you were booed at the california democratic convention when you said that only one candidate on this stage senator sanders identifies himself as a democratic socialist what are the policies or positions of your opponents that you think are veering towards socialism hickenlooper well i think that the bottom line is if we don t clearly define that we are not socialists the republicans are going to come at us every way they can and and call us socialists and if you look at the green new deal which i admire the sense of urgency and how important it is to do climate change i m a scientist but we can t promise every american a government job if you want to get universal healthcare coverage i believe that healthcare is a right and not a privilege but you can t expect to eliminate private insurance for 180 million people many of whom don t want to give it up in colorado we brought businesses and nonprofits together we got to near universal healthcare coverage we were the first state in america to to bring the environmental community and the oil and gas industry to address aggressively address methane emissions and we were also the first place to to expand reproductive rights on a scale basis that we reduced teen pregnancy by 54 percent we ve done the big progressive things people said it couldn t be done i ve done what pretty much everyone else up here is still talking about doing guthrie governor thank you senator sanders i ll give you a chance to to weigh in here what is your response to those who say nominating a a socialist would reelect donald trump sanders well i think the responses at the polls last poll i saw had us 10 points ahead of donald trump because the american people understand that trump is a phony that trump is a pathological liar and a racist and then he lied to the american people during his campaign he said he was going to stand up for working families well president trump you re not standing up for working families when you try to throw 32 million people off the healthcare that they have and that 83 percent of your tax benefits go to the top 1 percent that s how we be trump we expose him for the fraud that he is gillibrand in answer guthrie senator gillibrand i want to talk about guthrie senator gillibrand 30 seconds gillibrand i disagree with both their perspectives the debate we re having in our party right now is confusing because the truth is there s a big difference between capitalism on the one hand and greed on the other and so all the things that we re trying to change is when companies care more about profits when they do about people so if you re talking about ending gun violence it s the greed of the nra and the gun manufacturers that make any progress impossible it s the greed of the insurance companies and the drug companies when we want to try to get healthcare as a right and not a privilege guthrie senator gillibrand gillibrand so there may guthrie thank you gillibrand not be disagreement in the party because in truth we want healthy capitalism guthrie senator thank you gillibrand we don t want corrupted capitalism guthrie thank you i want to be fair to all the candidates gillibrand which is the definition of greed guthrie thank you senator bennet you have said it s possible to write policy proposals that have no basis in reality you might as well call them candy were you referring to any candidate or proposal in particular when you said that bennet are you was that directed to me guthrie yes that was your quote bennet well thank you that sounded like me thank you guthrie it was you bennet i appreciate it well gillibrand it definitely wasn t me bennet look first of all i agree completely with bernie about what the fundamental challenge we re facing as a country is 40 years of no economic growth for 90 percent of the american people one hundred and sixty thousand families in the top 1 percent have the same wealth as the bottom 90 percent and we got the worst income inequality that we ve had in 100 years where i disagree is on his solution on medicare for all you know i i have proposed getting to universal healthcare which we need to do it is a right healthcare is a right bennet we need to get to personal healthcare i believe the way to do that is by finishing the work we started with obamacare and creating a public option that every family and every person in america can make a choice for their family about whether they want a public option which for them would be like having medicare for all or whether they want to keep their private insurance i believe we will get there much more quickly if we do that bennet if i could just finish bernie mentioned that the taxes that we would have to pay because of those taxes vermont rejected medicare for all bennet in bernie s bill in bernie s bill i wrote guthrie we are going to talk about healthcare at length senator but at the moment my colleague gillibrand in senator sanders bill i wrote the part in senator sanders bill that is the transition that merges what the two senators said holt senator gillibrand the truth is if you have a buy in over a four or five year period you move us to single payer more quickly diaz balart senator we will get to this we will get to this bennet can i can i just say buttigieg on why he doesn t support free college diaz balart before we do i want to say hello and good evening buenos noches to mayor buttigieg buttigieg untranslated diaz balart untranslated many of your colleagues on stage support free college you do not why not buttigieg sure so college affordability is personal for us chasten and i have six figure student debt i believe in reducing student debt it s logical to me that if you can refinance your house you ought to be able to refinance your student debt i also believe in free college for low and middle income students for whom cost could be a barrier i just don t believe it makes sense to ask working class families to subsidize even the children of billionaires i think the children of the wealthiest americans can pay at least a little bit of tuition and while i want want tuition costs to go down i don t think we can buy down every last penny for that now there s something else that doesn t get talked about in the college affordability debate yes it needs to be more affordable in this country to go to college it also needs to be more affordable in this country to not go to college you should be able to live well afford rent be generous to your children inaudible little league whether you went to college or not that s one of many reasons we need to raise the minimum wage to at least 15 00 an hour rep swalwell and biden on generational change and yang explains his economic plan swalwell i got 100 000 in student loan debt myself i tell you if i count on the people who have been in government for the past 30 years who were around when this problem was created to be the ones to solve it it is going to be the next generation the 40 million of us who can t start a family can t take a good idea and start a business and can t buy our first home this is the generation that s going to be able to solve student loan debt this generation is ready to lead diaz balart mr mr yang your signature policy is to give every adult in the united states 1 000 a month no questions asked yang that s right diaz balart i think that s like 3 2 trillion a a year how would you do that yang i m sorry diaz balart oh so it s difficult to do if you have companies like amazon trillion dollar tech companies paying literally 0 in taxes while they re closing 30 percent of our stores now we need to put the american people in a position to benefit from all of these innovations in other parts of the economy and if we had a value added tax at even half the european level it would generate over 800 billion in new revenue which combined with the money in our hands it would be the trickle up economy from our people families and communities up we would spend the money and circulate through our regional economies and neighborhoods creating millions of jobs making our families stronger and healthier we d save money on things like incarceration homelessness services emergency room healthcare and just the value gains from having a stronger healthier mentally healthier population would increase gdp by 700 billion this is the move we have to make particularly as technology is now automating away millions of american s jobs why donald trump is our president today that we automated away 400 million manufacturing jobs in michigan ohio and pennsylvania and wisconsin and we re about to do the same thing to millions of retail jobs call center jobs fast food jobs truck driving jobs on and on throughout the economy diaz balart so i get to understand you a little better so you re saying 1 000 a month for everyone over 18 but a value added tax so you can spend that 1000 on value added tax yang well the value added tax what it would end up you would still be increasing the buying power of the bottom 94 percent of americans you have to spend a lot of money for a mild value add tax to eat up 12 000 a year per individual so for the average family with two or three adults it would 24 to 36 000 a year diaz balart ok so congressman swalwell want to talk a little bit about what mr yang is talking about and you just actually mentioned it many americans are worried about things like self driving cars robots drones artificial intelligence will cost them their jobs what would you to help people get the skills they need to adapt to this new world swalwell we must always be a country where technology creates more jobs than swalwell displaces and i ve seen the anxiety across america where the manufacturing floors go from 1 000 to 100 to one so we have to modernize our schools value the teachers who prepare our kids wipe the student debt from any teacher that goes into a community that needs it invest in america s communities especially where places where the best exports are people who move away to get skills but jose i was six years old when a presidential candidate came to the california democratic convention and said it s time to pass the torch to a new generation of americans that candidate was then senator joe biden joe biden was right when he said it was time the pass the torch to a new generation of americans 32 years ago he s still right today if we re going to solve the issues of automation ph pass the torch if we re going to solve the issues of climate chaos pass the torch if we re going to solve the issue of student loan debt pass the torch if we re going to end gun violence for families who are fearful of sending their kids to school pass the torch diaz balart vice president would you like to sing a torch song biden i would i m still holding on to that torch i want to make it clear to you look the fact of the matter is what we have to do is make sure that everybody is prepared better to go on to educate for an education the fact is that that s why i propose us focusing on schools that are in distress that s why i think we should triple the amount of money we spend for title i schools that s why i think we should have universal pre k that s why i think every single person who graduates from high school 65 out of 100 now need something beyond high school and we should provide for them to be able to get that education that s why there should be free community college cutting in half the cost of college that s why we should be in the position where we do not have anyone have to pay back the student debt when they get out they re making less than 25 000 a year their debt is frozen no interest payment until they get beyond that we can t put people in a position where they aren t able to go on and move on and so folks there s a lot we can do but we have to make continuing education available for everyone so that everyone can compete in the 21st century we re not doing that now diaz balart senator senator buttigieg as the youngest as the youngest guy on the stage i feel like i probably ought to contribute to the generation gillibrand before before sanders as part of joe s generation gillibrand i m for buttigieg i m all for gillibrand before we move on sanders as part of joe s generation gillibrand before before we move sanders let me respond the issue if i may say harris before we move on from education sanders is not generational diaz balart let s please please unknown yeah diaz balart senators senators unknown yeah harris we forgive crosstalk sanders the issue is who has the guts unknown inaudible comment sanders to take on wall street to take on the fossil fuel industry to take on the big money interest who have unbelievable influence over the economic and political life of this country swalwell these issues inaudible sanders that s the issue diaz balart senator harris senator harris diaz balart senator harris i m so sorry gillibrand can i have a turn diaz balart we will let all of these things senator harris we will let you all speak senator harris unknown been part of the issue unknown wait for evolution on these issues sen harris food fight moment harris hey guys you know what america does not want to witness a food fight they want to know how we re going to put food on their table so on that point part of the issue that is at play in america today and we ve all been traveling around the country i certainly have i m meeting people who are working two and three jobs you know this president walks around talking about and flouting his great economy right my great economy my great economy you ask him well how are you measuring this greatness of this economy of yours and he talks about the stock market well that s fine if you own stocks so many families in america do not you ask him how are you measuring the greatness of this economy of yours and they point to the jobless numbers and the unemployment numbers well yeah people in america are working they re working two and three jobs so when we talk about jobs let s be very clear in our america no one should have to work more than one job to have a roof over their head and food on the table diaz balart thank you very much senator yes holt you have all you ve all expressed an interest in talking about healthcare so let s williamson i d like to say something else candidates weigh in on healthcare holt let s let s talk about healthcare and this is going to be a show of hands question we asked a question about healthcare last night that spurred a lot of discussion as you know we re going to do it again now many people watching at home have health insurance of their employer who here would abolish their private health insurance in favor of a government run plan all right kirsten gill gillibrand senator gillibrand unknown can i gillibrand yeah so now it s my turn holt go ahead gillibrand so this is a very important issue so the plan that senator sanders and i and other support medicare for all is how you get to single payer but it has a buy in transition period which is really important in 2005 when i ran for congress in a two to one republican district i actually ran on medicare for all and i won that two to one republican district twice and the way i formulated it was simple anyone who doesn t have access to insurance they like they could buy it in a percentage of income they could afford so that s what we put into the transition period for our medicare for all plan i believe we need to get to universal healthcare as a right not a privilege to single payer the quickest way you get there is you create competition with the insurers god bless the insurers if they want to compete they can certainly try but they d never put people over their profits and i doubt they ever will so what will happen is people will choose medicare you will transition we would get to medicare for all and then your step to single payer is so short i would make it an earned benefit just like social security so that you buy in your whole life it is always there for you and it s permanent and it s universal holt senator your time is up i want to put that same question to mayor buttigieg buttigieg yeah we ve taught look everybody who says medicare for all every person in politics who allows that phrase to escape their lips has a responsibility to explain how you re actually supposed to get from here to there now here s how i would do it it s very similar i would call it medicare for all who want it you take something like medicare a flavor of that and you make it available on the exchanges it people can buy in and then if people like us are right that that will be not only a more inclusive plan but a more efficient plan than any of the corporate answers out there then it will be a very natural glide path to the single payer environment but let s remember even in countries that have outright socialized medicine like england even there there s still a private sector that s fine it s just that for our primary care we can t be relying on the tender verses of the corporate system this one is very personal for me i started out this year dealing with a terminal illness of my father i make decisions for a living and nothing could have prepared me for the kind of decisions our family faced but the thing we had going for us was that we never had to make those decisions based on whether it was gonna bankrupt our family because of medicare and i want every holt time buttigieg and i want every family to have that same freedom to do what is medically right not inaudible holt your time is complete vice president biden i want to put the question to you you were an ar one of the architects of obama care so where do we go from here biden look this is a very personal to me when my wife and daughter were killed in an automobile accident my two boys were really very badly injured i couldn t imagine what it d be like had i not had adequate healthcare available immediately and then when my son came home from iraq after a year he was diagnosed with terminal cancer and he was given months to live i can t fathom what would have happened if in fact they said by the way the last six months of your life you re on your own we re cutting off you ve used up your time the fact of the matter is that the quickest fastest way to do it is build on obama care to build on what we did and secondly secondly to make sure that everyone does have an option everyone whether they have private insurance employer insurance or no insurance they in fact can buy into the exchange to a medicare like plan and the way you do that you can do it quicker look urgency matters there s people right now facing what i ve faced and what we ve faced without any of the help i had we must move now i m against any democrat who opposes in fact holt vice president biden your time is biden takes down obama care and any republican who wants to get rid of it holt let me let me turn to senator sanders senator sanders you have basically you basically want to scrap the private health insurance system as we know it and replace it with a government run plan none of the states that have tried something like that california vermont new york has struggled with it have been successful if politicians can t make it work in those states how would you implement it on a national level how does this work sanders lester i find it hard to believe that every other major country on earth including my neighbor 50 miles north of me canada somehow has figured out a way to provide healthcare to every man woman and child and in most cases they re spending 50 percent per capita of what we are spending let s be clear let us be very clear the function of healthcare today from the insurance and drug company perspective is not to provide quality care to all in a cost effective way the function of the healthcare system today is to make billions in profits for the insurance companies and last year if you could believe it while we paid the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs and i will lower prescription drug prices in half in this country top ten companies made 69 billion in profit they will spend 100 s of millions of dollars lying to the american people telling us why we cannot have a holt senator sanders medicare for all holt i just have to follow up there how do you implement it on a national level sanders i m sorry holt how do you implement it on a national level given the fact that it s not succeeded in other states that have tried sanders i will tell you how we ll do it we ll do it the way real change has always taken place whether it was the labor movement the civil rights movement or the women s movement sanders we will have medicare for all when tens of millions of people are prepared to stand up and tell the insurance companies and the drug companies that their day is gone that healthcare is a human right not something to make huge profits off of holt all right ms williamson ms williamson this is a question for you holt excuse me excuse me i am addressing the question to ms williamson we have been talking a lot about access to health insurance but for many americans their most pressing concern is the high cost of healthcare how would you lower the cost of prescription drugs williamson well first of all the government should never have made the deal with the big farm at that they couldn t negotiate that was just part of the regular corruption by which multinational corporations have their way with us you know i wanted to say that while i agree with i i m with senator bennet and others but i agree with almost everything here i will tell you one thing it s really nice if we got all these plans but if you think we are going to beat donald trump by just having all of these plans you ve got another thing coming because he didn t when by saying he had a plan he won by simply saying make america great again we ve got to get deeper than just the superficial fixes as important as they are even if we are just talking about the superficial fixes ladies and gentlemen we don t have a health care system in the united states we have a sickness care system in the united states we just wait until somebody gets sick and then we talk about who s going to pay for the treatment and how they are going to be treated what we need to talk about is why so many americans have unnecessary chronic illnesses so many more compared to other countries and that gets back into not just the big pharma not just health insurance companies it has to do with chemical policies it has to do with environmental policies holt all right ms williamson your time williamson it has to do with food policies it has to do with drug policies holt thank you williamson it even has to do with environmental policies holt thank you senator senator bennet a question for you do you want to keep a system that we have in place with obamacare and build on it you mentioned that a moment ago is that enough to get us to universal coverage bennet i believe that will get us the quickest way there and i bought the vice president was very moving about this and mayor pete as well i had prostate cancer recently as you may know and that is why i was a little late getting in the race these same week my kid had her appendectomy out and i feel very strongly that families ought to be able to have this choice i think that is what the american people want i believe it will get us there quickly there are millions of people in america that do not have health insurance today because they can t they are too wealthy wealthy they make too much money to be on medicaid they can t afford health insurance when senator sanders says that canada is single payer there are 35 million people in canada there are 330 million people in the united states easily the number of people on a public option it could easily be 35 million and for them it would be medicare for all as mayor buttigieg says but for others that want to keep it they should be able to keep it and i think that will be the fastest way to get where we need to go also i will say bernie is a very honest person he has said over and over again unlike others that have supported this legislation over and over again that this will band making it illegal all insurance except cosmetic except insurance for i guess that s where plastic surgery everything else is banned under the medicare for all proposal holt i i let i let you go a little long there but i want but obviously senator sanders you have got a response harris i would like to add a point here holt senator sanders inaudible sanders just very briefly you know mike medicare is the most popular bennet i agree sanders health insurance program in the country people don t like their private insurance companies they like their doctors and hospitals under our plan people go to any doctor they want any hospital they want we will substantially lower the cost of healthcare in this country because we will stop the greed of the insurance companies and the drug companies harris on this issue on this issue we have to think about how this affects real people unknown inaudible lifetime inaudible for all and today harris the reality of how this affects real people is captured in a story that many of us heard and i will para paraphrase there is in the unite america a parent who is seeing that their child has a temperature that is out of control calls 911 what should i do and they say take the child to the emergency room and so they get in their car and they drive and there sitting in the parking lot outside of the emergency room looking at those sliding glass doors while they have the hand on the four head of their child knowing that if they walk through those sliding glass doors even though they have insurance they will be out 5000 deductible 5000 deductible when they walk through those doors holt senator senator harris that is what insurance companies are doing in america today guthrie we re going to continue this discussion swalwell i m one of those parents guthrie i wanted to put it in guthrie candidates please swalwell i m one of those parents i was just in the emergency room with my eight month old guthrie candidates please swalwell i m one of those parents i was just in the emergency room and i m telling you guthrie congressman thank you swalwell we fight health insurance companies every single week guthrie thank you swalwell we stand in line and pay expensive prescription drugs we have to have a healthcare guarantee if you re sick you re seen it and in america you never go broke because of it guthrie okay gillibrand with all due respect guthrie a lot of you have been talking tonight about these government healthcare plans that you proposed in one form or another this is a show of hands question and hold them up for a moment so people can see raise your hand if if your government plan would provide coverage for undocumented immigrants guthrie okay let me start with you mayor buttigieg why mayor buttigieg why buttigieg because our country is healthier when everybody is healthier and remember we re talking about something people are getting a given a chance to buy into in the same way that there are undocumented immigrants in my community who pay they pay sales taxes they pay property taxes directly or indirectly this is not about a handout this is an insurance program and we do ourselves no favor by having 11 million undocumented people in our country be unable to access healthcare but of course the real problem is we shouldn t have 11 million undocumented people with no pathway to citizenship it makes no sense and the american people the american people agree on what to do this is the crazy thing if leadership consists of of forming a consensus around a divisive issue this white house has divided us around a consensus issue the american people want a pathway to citizenship they wanted protections for dreamers we need to clean up the lawful immigration system like how my father immigrated to this country and as part of a compromise we can do whatever commonsense measures are needed at the border guthrie mayor buttigieg but washington can t deliver on something the american people want what does that tell you about the system we re living in it tells you it needs profound guthrie mayor thank you buttigieg structural reform guthrie vice president biden i believe you said that your health care plan would not cover undocumented immigrants could you explain your position biden i m sorry i beg your pardon i didn t hear guthrie i believe at the show of hands you did not raise her hand did you raise your hand biden oh no i did i but guthrie okay sorry sorry i so you said that they would be covered under your plan biden yes guthrie which is different than obama care biden yes but here here s the thing guthrie can you explain that change biden yes you cannot let as the mayor said you cannot let people who are sick no matter where they come from no matter what their status go uncovered you can t do that it s just going to be taking care of period you have to it s the humane thing to do but here s the deal the deal is that he s right about three things number one they in fact contribute to the well being of the country but they also for example they ve increased the lifespan of social security because they re they have a job they re paying the social security tax that s what they re doing it s increase the lifespan they would do the same thing in terms of reducing the overall cost of healthcare by them being able to be treated and not wait until there in extremis the other thing is folks look we can deal with these insurance companies we can deal with insurance companies by number one putting insurance executives in jail for their misleading their misleading advertising what they re doing on opioids what they re doing paying doctors to prescribe we should we could be doing this by making sure everyone who is on medicare that the government should be able to negotiate the price for what whatever the drug costs are we can do this by making sure that we re in a position that we in fact allow people you mean time s up williamson i just want to address guthrie your time s up vice president biden thank you holt actually you can hold off a minute we need to take a short break here we got a lot more we need to talk to all of you about so stick with us we re just getting started we ll be back with more from miami right after this candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants diaz balart thank you very much senator harris last month more than 130 000 migrants were apprehended at the southern border many of them are being detained including small children in private detention centers in florida and throughout our countries most of the candidates on this stage say the conditions in these facilities are abhorrent on january 20th 2021 if you are president what specifically would you do with the thousands of people harris yeah diaz balart who try to reach the united states every day and want a better life through asylum harris immediately on january 20th of 2021 i will first of all we cannot forget our daca recipients so i m going to start there i will immediately by executive action reinstate daca status and daca protection to those young people i will further extend protection for deferral of deportation for their parents and for veterans who we have so many who are undocumented and who have served our country and fought for our democracy i will also immediately put in place immediate process for reviewing the cases for asylum i will release children from cages i will get rid of the private detention centers and i will ensure that the this microphone that the president of the united states holds in her hand is use din a way that is about reflecting the values of our country and not about locking children up separating them from their parents and i have to just say that we have to think about this issue in terms of real people a mother who pays a coyote to transport her child through their country of origin through the entire country of mexico facing unknown peril to come here why would that mother do that i will tell you because she has decided for that child to remain where they are is worse but what does donald trump do he says go back to where you came from that is not reflective of our america and our values and it has got to end diaz balart hickenlooper day one if you are day one at the white house how do you respond williamson with these with these children diaz balart let me get to you in in in just a second williamson i m sorry diaz balart governor day one thousands of men women and children cross the border asking for asylum for a better life what do you do one day one hour one hickenlooper certainly the images we ve seen this week just compound the emotional impact that the world is judging us by if you had ever told me any time in my life that this country would sanction federal agents to take children from the arms of their parents put them in cages actually put them up for adoption in colorado we call that kidnapping i i would have called you i would have told you it was unbelievable and the first thing we have to do is recognize the humanitarian crisis on the border for what it is and make sure there are the sufficient facil facilities in place so that women and children are not separated from their families the children are with their families we have to make sure that that ice is completely reformed and they begin looking at their job in a humanitarian way where they are addressing the whole needs of the people that they are engaged with along the border and we have to make sure ultimately that we provide not just shelter but food clothing and access to medical care diaz balart ms williamson williamson yes what donald trump has done to these children and it s not just in colorado governor you re right it is kidnapping and it s extremely important for us to realize that if you forcibly take a child from their parents arms you are kidnapping them and if you take a lot of children and you put them in a detainment center thus inflicting chronic trauma upon them that s called child abuse this is collective child abuse williamson this is collective child abuse and when this is crime both of those things are a crime and if your government does it that doesn t make it less of a crime these are state sponsored crimes and what president and what president trump has done is not only attack these children not only demonize these immigrants he is attacking a basic principle of america s moral core we open our hearts to the stranger this is extremely important and it s also important for all of us remember and i have great respect for everyone who is on this on this on this stage but we are going to talk about what to do about healthcare well where have you been guys because if it s not just the matter of a plan and i haven t heard anybody on this stage who has talked about american foreign policy in latin america and how we might have in the last few decades contributed to something being more helpful sp diaz balart senator gillibrand what would you do as president with a reality gillibrand well one of the worst things about president trump that he has done to this country is he has torn apart the moral fabric of who we are when he started separating children at the border from their parents the fact that seven children have died in his custody the fact that dozens of children have been separated from their parents and they have no plan to reunite them so i would do a few things first i would fight for comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship second i would reform how we treat asylum seekers at the border i would have a community based treatment center where you are doing it within the communities where asylum seekers are given lawyers where there is real immigration judges not employees of the atty gen but appointed for life and have a community based system i would fund borders security but the worst thing president trump has done is he has diverted the funds away from cross border terrorism cross border human trafficking drug trafficking and gun trafficking and he is given that money to the for profit prisons i would not be spending money in for profit prisons diaz balart we had gillibrand to lock up children and asylum seekers diaz balart we had a very spirited debate on this stage last night on the topic of decriminalization of the border if if you would be so kind raise your hand if you think it should be a civil offense rather than a crime to cross the border without documentation can we keep the hands up so we can see them buttigieg let s remember that s not just a theoretical exercise that criminalization that is the basis for family separation you do away with that it is no longer possible of course it wouldn t be possible anyway in my presidency because it is dead wrong we have got to talk about one other thing because the republican party likes to cloak itself in the language of religion now our party doesn t talk about that as much largely for a very good reason which was we are committed to the separation of church and state and we stand for people of any religion and people of no religion but we should call out hypocrisy when we see it in for a party that associates itself with christianity to say that it is okay to suggest that god would smile on the division of families at the hands of federal agents that god would condone putting children in cages has lost all claim to ever use religious language again diaz balart mr vice president i don t know if you raised your hand or word just asking to speak biden look diaz balart would you decriminalize crossing the border without documents biden the first thing i would do is unite families i would surge immediately billions of dollars worth of help to the region the immediately look i talk about foreign policy i am the guy that got a bipartisan agreement at the very end of the campaign at the very end of our term to spend 740 million to deal with the problem and that was to go to the root cause of why people are leaving in the first place it was working we saw as you know a net decrease in the number of children who were coming the crisis was updated and along came this president and he said he immediately discontinued that we all talk about these things i did it i did it 740 now look second thing second thing we have to do the law now requires the reuniting of those families we would reunite those families period and if not we would put those children in a circumstance where they were safe until we could find their parents and lastly the idea that he is in court with his justice department saying children in cages do not need a bed do not need a blanket do not need a toothbrush diaz balart vice president biden that is outrageous diaz balart the obama biden administration was the obama biden administration deported more than three million americans my question to you is if an individual is living in the united states of america without documents and that is his only offense should that person be deported biden depending if they committed a a major crime they should be deported and the president was left in his president obama i think did a heck of a job to compare him to what what this guy is doing is absolutely i find close to immoral but the fact is that look we should not be locking people up we should be making sure we change the circumstance as we did why they would leave in the first place and those who come seeking asylum we should immediately have the capacity to absorb them keep them safe until they can be heard diaz balart a 15 second if you could if you wish to answer should someone who is here without documents and that is his only offense should that person be deported biden that person should not be the focus of deportation we should fundamentally change the way we deal with things diaz balart senator sanders i want to williamson i think it s important sanders suggest that i agree with a lot of what kamala just said and that is on day one we take out our executive order pen and we rescind every damn thing on this issue that trump has done number two number two picking up on the point that joe made we got a look at the root causes and you have a situation where honduras among other things is a failing state massive corruption you got gangs who are telling families that if a 10 year old does not join their gang their family is going to be killed what we have got to do on day one and invite the presidents and the leadership of central america and mexico together this is a hemispheric diaz balart thank you sanders problem that we have got to address diaz balart congressman swalwell what do you do swalwell day one diaz balart no if someone is here without documents and that is their only offense is that person to be deported swalwell no that person can be a part of this great american experience that person can contribute my congressional district is one of the most diverse in america and we see the benefits when people contribute and they become a part of the community and they re not in the shadow economy day one for me families are reunited this president though for immigrants there is nothing he will not do two separate a family cage a child or erase their existence by weaponizing the census and there is nothing that we cannot do in the courts and that i will not do as president to reverse that and to make sure that families always belong together diaz balart senator harris harris well thank you i will say no absolutely not they should not be deported and i actually this was one of the very few issues with which i disagreed with the administration with whom i otherwise had a great relationship and a great deal of respect but on the secure communities issue i was attorney general of california i led the second largest department of justice in the united states second only to the united states department of justice in a state of 40 million people and on this issue i disagreed with my president because the policy was to allow deportation of people who by ice s own definition were non criminals so as attorney general and the chief law officer of the state of california i issued a directive to the sheriffs of my state that they did not have to comply with detainers and instead should make decisions based on the best interest of public safety of their community because what i saw and i was tracking it every day i was tracking it and saw that that parents people who had not committed a crime even by ice s own definition were being deported and but i have to add a point here the problem with this kind of policy and i know it as a prosecutor diaz balart senator harris i want a rape victim to be able to run in the middle diaz balart senator harris of a to run in the middle of the street and waved down a police officer and report the crime against her i want anybody who has been the victim diaz balart senator harris of any real crime diaz balart senator harris to be able to do that diaz balart your time harris and not be afraid that if they do that diaz balart senator harris they will be deported because the abuser diaz balart senator harris will tell them it is they who is the criminal it is wrong holt we re going to turn harris it is wrong holt we re going to turn to the issue of trade now if we can holt last night we ask the candidates on this stage to name the greatest geopolitical threat facing the u s four of them mentioned china u s businesses say china steals our intellectual property and party leaders on both sides accuse china of manipulating their currency to keep the cost of goods artificially low i ll ask this to senator bennet to start off with how would you stand up to china bennet i think that first of all the biggest the biggest threat to our national security right now is russia not china and second on china we ve got comp because of what they ve done with our election in china i think the president s been right to push back on china but he s done it in completely the wrong way we should mobilize the entire rest of the world who all have a shared interest in pushing back on china s mercantilist trade policies and i think we can do that i d like to answer the other question before this as well holt you you have the time bennet when i when i when i see these kids at the border i see my mom because i know she sees herself because she was separated from her parents for years during the holocaust in poland and for donald trump to be doing what he s doing to children and their families at the borders i say this as somebody who wrote the immigration bill in 2013 that created a pathway to citizenship for 11 million people in this country that had the most progressive dream act that s ever been conceived much less passed it got 68 votes in the senate that had 46 billion of border security in it that was sophisticated 21st century border security not a medieval wall that the president has holt senator the time sorry bennet turned the border of the united states into a symbol of nativist hostility that the whole world is looking at when what we should be represented by is holt senator thank you bennet the statue of liberty which has brought my parents to this country to begin with we need to make a change yang and mayor buttigieg on concerns about china holt mr yang let me bring you in on this on the issue of china you ve expressed also of concerns about technology and taking jobs are you worried about china and if so how would you stand up against it yang well i just want to agree that i think russia is our biggest geopolitical threat because they ve been hacking our democracy successfully they ve been laughing their asses off about it for the last couple of years and we should focus on that before we start worrying about other threats now china they do they do inaudible property it s a massive problem but the tariffs and the trade war are just punishing businesses and producers and workers on both sides i met with a farmer in iowa who said he spent six years building up a buying relationship in china that s now disappeared and gone forever and the beneficiaries have not been american workers or or people in china it s been southeast asia and other producers that have then stepped into the void so we need to to crack down on chinese malfeasance in the trade relationship but the tariffs and the trade war are the wrong way to go holt how would you stand up against china buttigieg yeah i mean first of all we ve got to recognize that the china challenge really is a serious one this is not something to dismiss or wave away and if you look at what china is doing they re using technology for the perfection of dictatorship but their fundamental economic model isn t gonna change because of some tariffs i live in the industrial midwest folks who aren t in the shadow of a factory or somewhere near a soy field where i live and manufacturers and especially soy farmers are hurting tariffs are taxes and americans are gonna pay on average 800 more a year because of these tariffs meanwhile china is investing so that they could soon be able to run circles around us in artificial intelligence and this president is fixated on the china relationship as if all that mattered was the export balance on dishwashers we ve got a much bigger issue on our hands but in a moment when their authoritarian model is being held up as an alternative to ours because ours looks so chaotic compared to theirs right now because of our internal divisions the biggest thing we ve got to do is invest in our own domestic competitiveness if we disinvest holt all right mayor thank you buttigieg in our own infrastructure education we are never gonna be able to compete and if we really want to be an alternative a democratic alternative we actually have to demonstrate that we care about democratic values holt mayor thank you thank you for your answer buttigieg at home guthrie so far we re gonna take a quick break here candidates when we come back the questioning continues about college chuck todd and rachel maddow will be here much more with our candidates straight ahead chuck todd and rachel maddow take over without major technical difficulties holt welcome back to the presidential democratic debates at our center in miami guthrie as we bring in the questioning we want to bring in more members of our team diaz balart so let s turn over to chuck todd and rachel maddow todd rachel i had a dream that we ve done this before maddow no todd no maddow no this is definitely the first time todd definitely the first time thank you lester savannah and jose let s recap the rules one more time 20 candidates qualified for this first debate we heard from 10 of them from last night we are hearing from 10 more tonight breakdown for each night was selected at random candidates will have 60 seconds to answer direct questions 30 seconds for follow ups if necessary maddow because of this large field of candidates not every person will be able to comment on everything but the less audience reaction there is the more time they will all get mayor buttigieg speaks out on civil rights and the shooting in his hometown over the course of the next hour we will hear from all of these candidates we are going to begin this hour with mayor buttigieg in the last five years civil rights activists in our country have led a national debate over race and the criminal justice system your community of south bend indiana has recently been in uproar over an officer involved shooting the police force in south bend is now 6 percent black in a city that is 26 percent black why has that not improved over your two terms as mayor buttigieg because i couldn t get it done my community is in anguish right now because of an officer involved shooting a black man eric logan killed by a white officer and i m not allowed to take sides until the investigation comes back the officer says he was attacked with a knife but he didn t have his body camera on it s a mess and we re hurting and i could walk you through all of the things that we have done as a community all of the steps that we took from bias training to de escalation but it didn t save the life of eric logan and when i look into his mother s eyes i have to face the fact and nothing that i say will bring him back this is an issue that is facing our community and so many communities around the country and until we move policing out from the shadow of systemic racism whatever this particular incident teaches us we will be left with the bigger problem of the fact that there is a wall of mistrust put up one racist act at a time not just from what has happened in the past but what s happening around the country in the present it threatens the well being of every community and i am determined to bring about a day when a white person driving a vehicle and a black person driving a vehicle when they see a police officer approaching feels the exact same thing a feeling not of fear but of safety i m determined to bring that day about maddow thank you mr mayor hickenlooper mayor buttigieg mayor buttigieg if i could ask one question because i think maddow governor i ll give you 30 seconds hickenlooper i think that the question they are asking in south bend i think across the country is why is it taking so long we had a shooting when i first became mayor 10 years before ferguson and the community came together and we created an office of the independent monitor civilian oversight commission we diversified the police force in two years we actually did de escalation training i think the real question that america should be asking is why five years after ferguson every city doesn t have this level of police accountability maddow governor hickenlooper thank you hickenlooper we buttigieg i ve got to respond to that look we ve taken so many steps toward police accountability that the fop just denounced me for too much accountability we re obviously not there yet and i accept responsibility for that swalwell inaudible you should fire the chief buttigieg so under indiana law this will be investigated and there will be accountability for the officer involved swalwell but you re the mayor you should fire the chief if that s the policy and someone died williamson all of these issues are extremely important but there are specifics there are symptoms and the underlying cause has to do with deep deep deep realms of racial injustice both in our criminal justice system and in our economic system and the democratic party should be on the side of reparations for slavery for this very reason i do not believe i do not believe that the average american is a racist but the average american is woefully undereducated about the history of race in the united states todd vice president biden we re going to get to you hang on we re going to get harris i would like to say maddow ms williamson thank you very much balart vice president biden i m going to we re going to get to you hang on we re going to get sen harris dramatically confronts biden on his civil rights record harris as we inaudible on this stage i would like to speak harris on the issue of race maddow senator harris harris and so what i will say maddow i will senator harris if i could if i could preface harris is that i agree maddow this we ll give you 30 seconds because we re going to come back to you on on this again in just a moment go for 30 seconds harris okay so on the issue of race i couldn t agree more that this is an issue that is still not being talked about truthfully and honestly i there is not a black man i know be he a relative a friend or a coworker who has not been the subject of some form of profiling or discrimination growing up my sister and i had to deal with the neighbor who told us her parents couldn t play with us because she because we were black and i will say also that that in this campaign we ve also heard and i m going to now direct this to vice president biden i do not believe you are a racist and i agree with you when you commit yourself to the importance of finding common ground biden mm hmm harris but i also believe and it s personal and i i was actually very it was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two united states senators who built their reputations and career on segregation of race in this country and it was not only that but you also worked with them to oppose bussing and you know there was a little girl in california who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools and she was bussed to school every day and that little girl was me so i will tell you that on this subject it cannot be an intellectual debate among democrats we have to take it seriously we have to act swiftly as attorney general of california i was very proud to put in place a a requirement that all my special agents would wear body cameras and keep those cameras on maddow senator harris thank you vice president biden you have been invoked we are going to give you a chance to respond biden that s a mischaracterization of my position across the board i did not praise racists that is not true number one number two if we want to have this campaign litigated on who supports civil rights and whether i did or not i m happy to do that i was a public defender i didn t become a prosecutor i came out and i left a good law firm to become a public defender when in fact when in fact when in fact my city was in flames because of the the assassination of dr king number one now number two as the u s as excuse me as the vice president of the united states i worked with a man who in fact we worked very hard to see to it we dealt with these issues in a major major way the fact is that in terms of busing the busing i never you would ve been able to go to school the same exact way because it was a local decision made by your city council that s fine that s one of the things i argued for that we should not be we should be breaking down these lines but so the bottom line here is look everything i have done in my career i ran because of civil rights i continue to think we have to make fundamental changes in civil rights and those civil rights by the way include not just african americans but the lgbt community they don t harris but vice president biden do you agree today do you agree today that you were wrong to oppose busing in america then biden no harris do you agree biden i did not oppose bussing in america what i opposed is bussing ordered by the department of education that s what i opposed i did not oppose harris well there was a failure of of states to to integrate biden no but harris public schools in america i was part of the second class to integrate berkley california public schools almost two decades after brown v board of education biden because your city council made that decision it was a local decision harris so that s where the federal government must step in biden the the federal government must harris that s why we have the voting rights act and the civil rights act that s why we need to pass the equality act that s why we need to pass the era because there are biden that harris moments in harris history where states fail to preserve the civil rights of all people biden i have supported the era from the very beginning when i ran for inaudible todd vice president biden 30 seconds because i want to bring other people into this biden i i supported the era from the very beginning i am the guy that extended the voting rights act for 25 years we got to the place where we got 98 out of 98 votes in the united states senate doing it i have also argued very strongly that we in fact deal with the notion of denying people access to the ballot box i agree that everybody once they in fact my time is up i m sorry todd thank you vice president harris all of these things inaudible candidates comment on diversity todd senator sanders senator sanders i want to go to you on this you said on the day you launched your campaign that voters should focus on what people stand for not a candidate s race or age or sexual orientation any democrats are very excited by the diversity of this field on this stage and on last night stage and the perspective that diverse city brings to this contest and to these issues are you telling democratic voters that diverse city should it matter when they make this decision sanders no absolutely not unlike the republican party we encourage diverse city we believe in diverse city that is what america is up about but in addition to diversity in terms of having more women more people from the gb l lgbt community we also have to do something else and that is we have to ask ourselves a simple question and that how come to day the worker in the middle of our economy is making no more money than he or she made 45 years ago and that in the last 30 years the top 1 percent has seen a 21 trillion increase in their wealth we need a party that is diverse but we need a party that has the guts to stand up to the powerful special interest who have so much power over the economic and political life of this country todd senator gillibrand i want to give you 30 seconds on this gillibrand well first of all where bernie left off we have heard a lot of good ideas on this stage tonight and a lot of plans but the truth is until you go to the root of the corruption the money in the in politics the fact that washington is run by these special interest you are never going to solve any of these problems i have the most comprehensive approach that experts agree is the most transformative plan to actually take on political corruption to get money out of politics through publicly funded elections to have clean elections if we do that and get money out of politics we can guarantee healthcare as a right not a privilege we can deal with institutional racism we can t take on income inequality and we can take on the corporate corruption that runs washington biden the first constitutional amendment to do that was introduced by me when i was a young senator candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with mitch mcconnell todd thank thank you vice president i want to shift topics here senator bennet the next question is for you on the issue of partisan gridlock president obama promised in 2012 that after his reelection republicans would want to work with democrats fever would break that did not happen now vice president biden is saying the same thing that if he is elected in 2020 both parties will want to work together should voters believe that somehow if there is a democratic president in 2021 that gridlock is going to magically disappear bennet gridlock will not magically disappear as long as mitch mcconnell is there first second second that is why it is so important for us to when not just the presidency to have somebody that can run in all 50 states but to but to win the senate as well and that is why we have to propose policies that can be supported like medicare x ph so that we can build a broad coalition of americans to overcome broken washington dc i agree with what senator gillibrand was saying and share a lot of her views we need to in gerrymandering in wash and we need to end political gerrymandering in washington the court today said they couldn t do anything about it we need to overturn citizens united the court was the one that gave us citizens united and the attack on voting rights in shelby versus holder is something we need to deal with all of those things has happened since vice president biden was in the senate and we face structural problems that we have to overcome with a broad coalition it s the only way we can do it we need to root out the corruption in washington expand people s right to get to the polls todd time is up thank you bennet and i think then we can succeed todd vice president biden biden can i respond todd thirty seconds i want i what it does sound as if you haven t seen what s been happening in the united states senate over the last 12 years it didn t happen why biden i have seen what happened just sense we were vice president we needed three votes to pass an 800 billion recovery act that kept us from going into depression i got three votes changed we needed to be able to keep the government from shutting down and going bankrupt i got mitch mcconnell to raise taxes 600 billion by raising the top rate and as recently as after the president got elected i was able to put together a coalition on the cures act that billions of dollars go into cancer research bipartisan but sometimes you can t do that sometimes you just have to go out and beat them i went into 20 states over 60 candidates todd okay thank you biden and guess what we beat them we won back the senate bennet chuck chuck todd thank you bennet chuck todd thank you mr bennet the problem with what the vice todd go ahead 30 seconds bennet no what todd yeah 30 seconds go ahead bennet we sometimes you do have to beat them but but the deal that he talked about with mitch mcconnell was a complete victory for the tea party it extended the bush tax cuts permanently the democratic party had been running against that for 10 years we ve lost that economic argument because that deal extended almost all those bush tax cuts permanently and put in place the mindless cuts that we still are dealing with today that are called the sequester that was a great deal for mitch mcconnell biden oh come on bennet it was a terrible deal for america todd thank you thank you senator bennet gillibrand and you heard from republicans todd right right gillibrand you heard from the republicans todd go ahead 30 seconds gillibrand that the reason why the trump tax cut had to be passed is because they had to pay back their donors you heard it they actually said those words so the corruption in washington is real and it is something that makes every one of the plans we ve heard about over the last several months impossible and i have the most comprehensive approach to do it with clean elections publicly funded elections so we restore the power of our democracy into the hands of the voters not into the koch brothers we were talking about issues imagine we re in florida imagine the parkland kids having as much power in our democracy todd thank you gillibrand as the koch brothers or the nra todd thank you senator gillibrand thank you gillibrand imagine their voices carrying farther and wider than todd thank you gillibrand anyone else because their voice is needed todd go ahead senator gillibrand i m trying gillibrand and you can and as president todd to get everyone in here gillibrand it s the first thing i m going todd thank you gillibrand to do because nothing else is possible whether it s education or healthcare or ending institutional racism todd thank you very much right candidates on abortion rights maddow senator sanders i d like to put a different question to you roe versus wade has been the law of the land since 1973 now that there is a conservative majority on the supreme court several republican controlled state have passed laws to severely restrict or even ban abortion one of those laws could very well make it to the supreme court during your presidency if you re elected president what is your plan if row is struck down in the court while your president sanders well my plan is somebody who believes for a start that a woman s right to control her own body is a constitutional right that government and politicians should not infringe on that right we will do everything we can to defense our roe versus wade second of all let me make let me make let me make a promise here you asked about litmus test my litmus test is i will never appoint any nominate any justice to the supreme court unless that justice is 100 percent clear he or she will defend roe v wade third of all i do not believe in packing the court sanders right now but i do believe that constitutionally we have the power to rotate judges to other courts and that brings in new blood into the supreme court and a majority i hope that will understand that a woman has the right to control her own body and that corporations cannot run the united states of america maddow senator maddow i m going to give you 10 additional seconds because inaudible what if the court has already overturned roe and roe is gone all of the things you have described would be to try to preserve roe if roe was gone what could you do as president to preserve abortion rights sanders well first of all let me tell you this didn t come up yet but let s face this medicare for all guarantees every woman in this country the right to have an abortion if she wants it maddow thank you senator gillibrand and can i just address this for a second and i and i want to talk directly directly to america s women and to men who love them women s reproductive rights are under assault by president trump and the republican party thirty states are trying to overturn roe v wade right now and it is mind boggling to me that we are debating this on this stage in 2019 among democrats whether women should have access to reproductive rights i think we have to stop playing defense and start playing offense but let me tell you one thing about politics because it goes to the corruption of the deal making when the door is closed negotiations are made there are conversations about women s rights and compromises have been made behind our backs that s how we got to hyde that s how the hyde amendment was created a compromise by leaders of both parties then we have the aca during the aca neg negotiations i had to fight like heck with other women to make sure that contraception wasn t sold down the river or abortion services and so what we need to know is imagine this one question when we beat president trump and mitch mcconnell walks into the oval office god forbid to do negotiations who do you want when that door closes to be sitting behind that desk to fight for women s rights i have been the fiercest advocate for women s reproductive freedom for over a decade maddow thank you gillibrand and i promise you as president todd senator gillibrand when that door closes i will guarantee women s reproductive inaudible no matter what todd thank you thank you candidates on climate todd we re moving to climate we re moving to climate guys senator harris addressing you first on this you live in a state that has been hit by drought wildfires flooding climate change it is a major concern for voters in your state that s pretty obvious obvious of the state as well last night voters heard many of the candidates weigh in on their proposals explain specifically what yours is harris well first of all i don t even call it climate change it s a climate crisis it represents an existential threat to us as a species and the fact that we have a president of the united states who has embraced science fiction over science fact will be to our collective peril i visited while the embers were smoldering the wildfires in california i spoke with firefighters who were in the midst of fighting a fire while their own homes were burning and on this issue it is a it is a critical issue that is about what we must do to confront what is immediate and before us right now that is why i support a green new deal it is why i believe on day one and as president will re enter us in the paris agreement because we have to take these issues seriously and frankly we have a president of the united states we talked about you asked before what is the greatest national security threat to the united states it s donald trump and i m going to tell you why and i m going to tell you why because i agree climate change represents an existential threat he denies the science you want to talk about north korea real threat in terms of nuclear arsenal but what doe she do he embraces kim jong un a dictator harris history where states fail to preserve the civil rights of all people biden i have supported the era from the very beginning when i ran for inaudible todd vice president biden 30 seconds because i want to bring other people into this biden i i supported the era from the very beginning i am the guy that extended the voting rights act for 25 years we got to the place where we got 98 out of 98 votes in the united states senate doing it i have also argued very strongly that we in fact deal with the notion of denying people access to the ballot box i agree that everybody once they in fact my time is up i m sorry todd thank you vice president harris all of these things inaudible todd senator sanders senator sanders i want to go to you on this you said on the day you launched your campaign that voters should focus on what people stand for not a candidate s race or age or sexual orientation any democrats are very excited by the diversity of this field on this stage and on last night stage and the perspective that diverse city brings to this contest and to these issues are you telling democratic voters that diverse city should it matter when they make this decision sanders no absolutely not unlike the republican party we encourage diverse city we believe in diverse city that is what america is up about but in addition to diversity in terms of having more women more people from the gb l lgbt community we also have to do something else and that is we have to ask ourselves a simple question and that how come to day the worker in the middle of our economy is making no more money than he or she made 45 years ago and that in the last 30 years the top 1 percent has seen a 21 trillion increase in their wealth we need a party that is diverse but we need a party that has the guts to stand up to the powerful special interest who have so much power over the economic and political life of this country todd senator gillibrand i want to give you 30 seconds on this gillibrand well first of all where bernie left off we have heard a lot of good ideas on this stage tonight and a lot of plans but the truth is until you go to the root of the corruption the money in the in politics the fact that washington is run by these special interest you are never going to solve any of these problems i have the most comprehensive approach that experts agree is the most transformative plan to actually take on political corruption to get money out of politics through publicly funded elections to have clean elections if we do that and get money out of politics we can guarantee healthcare as a right not a privilege we can deal with institutional racism we can t take on income inequality and we can take on the corporate corruption that runs washington biden the first constitutional amendment to do that was introduced by me when i was a young senator on whether partisan gridlock would disappear todd thank thank you vice president i want to shift topics here sen bennet the next question is for you on the issue of partisan gridlock pres obama promised in 2012 that after his reelection republicans would want to work with democrats fever would break that did not happen now vice president biden is saying the same thing that if he is elected in 2020 both parties will want to work together should voters believe that somehow if there is a democratic pres in 2021 that gridlock is going to magically disappear bennet gridlock will not magically disappear as long as mitch mcconnell is there first second second that is why it is so important for us to when not just the presidency to have somebody that can run in all 50 states but to but to win the senate as well and that is why we have to propose policies that can be supported like medicare x so that we can build a broad coalition of americans to overcome broken washington dc i agree with what senator gillibrand was saying and share a lot of her views we need to in gerrymandering in wash and we need to end political gerrymandering in washington biden and new science and technology to be the exporter not only of the green economy but economy that can create millions of jobs but i would immediately rejoin the paris climate accord i would up the ante in that accord which it calls for because we make up 15 percent of the problem 85 percent of the world makes up the rest and so we have to have someone who knows how to corral the rest of the world bring them together and get something done like we did in our administrator maddow senators senators i want to give you 30 seconds sanders look maddow to follow up but i m going to hold you to 30 seconds sanders look the old ways are no longer relevant the scientists tell us we have 12 years because there s irreparable damage to this planet this is a global issue what the president of the united states should do is not deny the reality of climate change but tell the rest of the world that instead of spending 1 5 trillion on weapons of destruction let us get together for the common enemy and that is to transform the world energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy maddow thank you sanders the future of the planet rests on us doing that swalwell there there s todd before we go swalwell there s todd hang on maddow before we leave this topic swalwell here s a solution pass the torch pass the torch to the generation that s going to feel the effects unknown no sanders of climate change take on the fossil fuel swalwell pass the torch to the generation sanders is crosstalk the solution unknown that s inventive enough gillibrand agreed and maddow before we leave this topic here s something you all want to weigh in on hold on a moment todd just just gillibrand campaign to the republican party maddow hold on moment todd just trust us on this williamson and the fact todd we re going to marianne williamson invokes john f kennedy williamson that somebody has a younger body doesn t mean you don t have old ideas swalwell no we have new ideas williamson and john kennedy john kennedy swalwell we have real new ideas williamson did not say john kennedy did not say i m i have a plan to get a man to the moon and so we re going to do it and i think we can all work together and maybe we can get a man on the moon john kennedy said by the end of this decade we are going to put a man on the moon williamson because john kennedy was back in the day when politics included the people it included imagination and it included great dreams and included great plans maddow ms williamson todd thank you ms williamson williamson and i have a career not making the political plans but i have had a career harnessing the inspiration and the motivation and the excitement of people todd thank you ms williamson williamson masses of people when we know that when we say todd thank you williamson we are going to turn from a dirty economy todd thank you williamson to a clean economy we re going to have a green new deal we re going to create millions of jobs we re going to do this within the next 12 years because i m not interested in just winning the next election we are todd thank you ms williamson williamson inaudible our grandchildren todd all right we got to williamson then you will have it candidates on what their first issue would be if elected todd we re going to sneak in a break in a minute but before we go i m going to go down the line here and i m asking you please for one or two words all right please maddow really todd president obama in his first year wanted to address both healthcare and climate and he could only get one signature issue accomplished it was obviously healthcare he didn t get to do climate change you may only get one shot and your first issue that you re going to push you get one shot that it may be the only thing you get passed what is that first issue for your presidency eric swalwell you re first swalwell for parkland for orlando for every community effected by gun violence ending gun violence todd senator bennet bennet climate change and the lack of economic mobility bernie talks about todd senator gillibrand gillibrand passing a family bill of rights that includes a national paid leave plan universal pre k affordable daycare and making sure that women and families can thrive in the workplace no matter who they are todd all right harris oh i like that todd senator harris harris so passing a middle class and working families tax cut todd that s one harris daca guns todd i ll give you credit for the first thing you said the tax cut senator sanders first thing sanders the premise that there s only one or two issues out there todd i m not saying there s only one or two sanders is enormous crisis todd senator sanders sanders we need a political revolution people have got to stand up and take on the special interests we can transform this country todd vice president biden your first issue mr vice president biden i think you ve so underestimated what barack obama did he s the first man to bring together the entire world 196 nations to commit to deal with climate change immediately i don t i don t buy that the first the first thing i would do is make sure that we defeat donald trump todd okay biden period todd mayor buttigieg your first priority your first issue as president that you are going to block and tackle buttigieg we ve got to fix our democracy before it s too late get that right and climate immigration taxes and every other issue gets better todd mr mr yang yang i would pass a 1 000 freedom dividend for every american adult starting at age 18 which would speed us up on climate change because if you get the boot off of people s throats they re inaudible climate change much more clearly todd okay governor hickenlooper hickenlooper i would do a collaborative approach to climate change and i would pronounce it well before the election to make sure we don t reelect the worst president in american history todd and ms williamson you have the last word williamson my first call is to prime minister of new zealand who said that her role is to make new zealand the place where it s the best place in the world for a child to grow up and i would tell her girlfriend you are so wrong because the united states of america is going to be the best place todd thank you williamson in the world for a child to grow up we are going to have todd thank you you guys were close with the short at least it was shorter maddow no they weren t not at all todd all right c minus candidates on gun control maddow we re gonna take a quick break we ll be right back with these candidates right after this maddow welcome back to the democratic candidates debate in miami we are going to continue the questioning now with lester in the audience we aren t we are in a second going to have a question from lester in the audience that was just a fake out todd we re going to go the issue of guns and maddow congressman swalwell among this field of candidates you have a unique position on gun reform you re proposing that the government should buy back every assault weapon in america and it should be mandator how do you envision that working especially in states where gun rights are a flashpoint swalwell keep your pistols keep your rifles keep your shotguns but we can take the most dangerous weapons from the most dangerous people we have the nra on the ropes because of the moms because the brady group because of giffords because of march for our lives but i m the only candidate on this stage calling for a ban and buyback of every single assault weapon in america i ve seen the plans of the other candidates here they would all leave 15 million assault in our communities they wouldn t do a single thing to save a single life in parkland i will approach this issue as a prosecutor i will approach it as the only person on this stage who has voted and passed background checks but also as a parent of a generation who sends our children to school where we look at what they re wearing so we can remember it in case we have to identify them later a generation who has seen thousands of black children killed in our streets and a generation who goes to the theater and we actually where the fire exits are we don t have to live this way we must be a country who loves our children more than we love our guns maddow senator sanders a vermont newspaper recently released portions of an interview you gave in 2013 in which you said my own view on guns is everything being equal states should make those decisions sanders no maddow has your thinking changed since then do you now think there s a federal role to play sanders mischaracterization of my thinking look maddow it s a quote of you sanders we have a gun we have a gun crisis right now 40 000 people a year are getting killed in 1988 rachel when it wasn t popular i ran on a platform of banning assault weapons and in fact lost that race for congress i have a d minus voting record from the nra and i believe that what we need is comprehensive gun gun legislation that among other things provides universal background we end the gun show loophole we end the straw man provision and i believed in 1988 and i believe today that assault weapons swalwell why would you why would you leave 15 million on the streets sanders assault weapons assault weapons swalwell why would you leave senator sanders are weapons swalwell you leave 15 million on the streets sanders are from the military swalwell though sanders and that they should not be on the streets swalwell why do you leave sanders of america swalwell you would your plan leaves them on the streets you leave 15 million on the streets sanders we ban the sale and we ban the sale and distribution swalwell will you buy them back sanders and that s what i ve believed for many years swalwell will you will you buy them back harris and then and and sanders if people want to buy if the government wants to do that if people want bring it back swalwell but you re going to be the government sanders yes swalwell will you buy them back sanders yeah maddow senator harris we re going to give you 30 seconds here harris thank you i think your idea is a great one congressman swalwell and i will say there are a lot of great idea the problem is congress has not had the courage to act which is why when elected president of the united states i will give the united states congress 100 days to pull their act together bring all these good ideas together and put a bill on my desk for signature and if they do not i will take executive action and i will put in place the most comprehensive background check policy we ve had i will require the atf to take the licenses of gun dealers who violate the law and i will banned by executive order the importation of assault weapons because i m going to tell you as a prosecutor i have seen more autopsy photographs than i care to tell you i have hugged more mothers who are the mothers of homicide victims and i have attended more police officer funerals it is enough it is enough and there have been plenty of good ideas from members of the united states congress there s been no action as president i will take action maddow mayor buttigieg i want to bring you in on this sir a lot of discussion about assault rifles that are often as shorthanded as military style weapons you are the only person on the stage tonight with military experience as a veteran of the afghanistan war will military families does that inform your thinking on this view do you believe that military families or america s veterans will at large have a different take on this than the other americans who we ve been talking about and who congressman swalwell is appealing to with his buyback program buttigieg yeah of course because we trained on some of these kinds of weapons look every part of my life experience informs this being the mayor of a city where the worst part of the job is dealing with violence we we lose a as many as were lost at parkland every two or three years in my city alone and this is tearing communities apart if more guns made us safer we be the safest country on earth it doesn t work that way and commonsense measures like universal background checks can t seem to get delivered by washington even when most republicans let alone most americans agree it s the right thing to do and as somebody who trained on weapons of war i can tell you that there are weapons that have absolutely no place in american cities or neighborhoods in peacetime ever maddow vice president biden 30 seconds biden a real 30 seconds maddow a real 30 seconds biden okay i m the only person that s beaten the nra nationally i m the guy that got the brady bill passed the background checks number one number two we increased that background check when when during the obama biden administration i m also the only guy that got assault weapons banned banned and the number of clips in a gun banned and so folks look and i would buy back those weapons we already started talking about that we tried to get it done i think it can be done and it should be demanded that we do it and that s a good expenditure of money and lastly we should have smart guns no gun should be able to be sold unless your biometric measure could pull that trigger it s within our right to do that we can do that our enemy is the gun manufacturers not the nra the gun manufacturers maddow mr vice president thank you buttigieg but the nra is taking orders from todd all right buttigieg the gun manufacturers that s the problem todd lester holt has our next question lester take it away holt all right chuck this is a question from our viewers we put some suggestions that asked maybe they could share some of here s one that came from kathleen ph from canby oregon who writes many fear the current administration has inflicted irrevocable harm on our governing institutions and norms and in the process on our reputation abroad the question is what do you see as importance early steps in reversing the damage done and will put this one to senator bennet bennet thank you very much what an excellent question first of all we have to restore our democracy at home the rest of the world is looking for us for leadership we have a president who doesn t believe in the role of law he doesn t believe in freedom of the press he doesn t believe in an independent judiciary he believes in the corruption that he s brought to washington d c and that is what we have to change and that s why everybody is up here tonight and i appreciate the fact that there up here for that reason second we ve got to we ve got to restore the relationships that he s destroyed with our allies not just in europe he flew to the g20 last night and attacked japan germany and a third ally of ours without saying anything about north korea or russia and when you ve got a situation where you have a president who says something happens in the straits of hormuz and the whole world doesn t know whether to believe it or not that is a huge problem when it comes to the national security of the united states of america todd this is a perfect time bennet and we need to change that todd thank you senator bennet this is a perfect time for me to do another one of candidates on the first relationship they would reset as president todd thank you senator bennet this is the perfect time for me to do another one of inaudible the line and this is what this question is which is you are going to have to re you are like
here s our summary of key events overnight that affect new zealand with news markets are on tenterhooks over the g20 talks at the g20 summit the us china trade talks haven t yet started between the two leaders but is becoming clear that the best case outcome will only be more talks however the chinese are sending positive signals the americans reported a large soybean sale to china in a surprise deal yesterday but in something of an interesting counter signal apple said it is shifting the production of the only model it makes in the us the macbook pro to china and most americans and by a substantial margin doubt the administration s tariff strategy although it is a highly partisan issue the australians signaled that they will be throwing their weight behind the tpp and the rcep if the americans and chinese can t agree to work together the rcep includes china and india although the tpp doesn t but it does include japan neither include the us the inflation measure the us fed watches closely core pce personal consumption expenditure came in for may at 1 6 unchanged from april analysts had expected a minor dip but that didn t happen in any event it is still below the fed s target and it isn t moving another closely watched index is the chicago purchasing managers survey and that fell into contraction in june for the first time since january 2017 this is just another in the set of regional factory surveys showing american manufacturing is either without any growth or is in contraction the most telling aspect is that new orders are falling these pullbacks haven t yet flowed through to consumers yet although the latest sentiment survey seems to have topped out and it is those on higher incomes who are reporting the most concern about the future the surveyors said and it is more than just the us the trade tensions are generating a global slump in factory activity the latest update of the bank of canada senior loan officers survey paints a picture of a tough lending environment there even if it did ease slightly in june in china the central bank authorities are jawboning banks to be restrained in their mortgage lending despite recently officially easing lending conditions in many smaller cities that easing brought a quick rise in prices in may that is obviously worrying them this latest pullback has seen chinese mortgage rates rise from 4 9 to about 5 15 japan vehicle production has recovered somewhat according to the april data released overnight which showed a 4 7 year on year gain and may industrial production rose more than expected in japan reducing the year on year decline to its lowest level in two years the eu and a group of south american countries have agreed a large multilateral trade deal apparently the largest one the eu has ever done it took 20 years of negotiation in australia new rba data shows that lending to businesses and property buyers grew only marginally in may while the fall in personal loans got deeper in fact australian housing debt grew just 3 7 in the years to may the slowest annual growth rate since records started in 1976 the s p500 looks like it will close today up 0 6 but over the week it will record a small loss of about 0 4 european markets ended their week much more positively however up more than 1 on the day for the week the dax was up 0 7 yesterday asian markets all ended lower on the day as

ten democrats faced off thursday in the dramatic second night of the 2020 democratic debate in miami front runner and former vice president joe biden stood center stage alongside high profile candidates including vermont sen bernie sanders california sen kamala harris and south bend ind mayor pete buttigieg the most dramatic moment of the evening was arguably when harris confronted biden about his opposition to a busing plan to integrate segregated schools noting that the issue impacted her personally as a child the showdown came just one night after the debates kicked off with sen elizabeth warren julián castro sen cory booker and others here is a full transcript of the second night of the first 2020 democratic debate sen sanders get the first question on taxes holt and good evening once again welcome to the candidates and our spirited audience here tonight in the arsht center and across america tonight we continue the spirited debate about the future of the country how to tackle our most pressing problems and getting to the heart of the biggest issues in this democratic primary guthrie tonight we are going to talk about healthcare immigration we re also to dive into the economy jobs climate change as well diaz balart as a quick rules of the road before we begin and they may sound familiar 20 candidates cal qualified for this first debate as we said we heard from 10 last night and we will hear from 10 more tonight the breakdown for each night was selected at random the candidates will have 60 seconds to answer 30 seconds for follow ups holt and because of the large field of candidates not every person is going to be able to weigh in on every topic but over the course of the next two hours we will hear from everyone guthrie and we love our audience but we would like to ask them to keep their reactions to a minimum and we are not going to hold back making sure that candidates stick to time so with that business take care taken care of let s get to it and we are going to start today with senator sanders good evening to you you have called for big new government benefits like universal healthcare and free college in a recent interview you said you suspected that americans would be quote delighted to pay more taxes for things like that my question to you is will taxes go up for the middle class in a sanders administration and if so how do you sell that to voters sanders well you are quite right we have a new vision for america and at a time when we have three people in this country owning more wealth than the bottom half of america while 500 000 people are sleeping out on the streets today we think it is time for change real change and by that i mean that healthcare in my view is a human right and we have got to pass a medicare for all single payer system under that system by the way vast majority of the people in this country will be paying significantly less for healthcare than they are right now i believe that education is the future for this country and that is why i believe that we must make public colleges and universities tuition free and eliminate student debt and we do that by placing a tax on wall street every proposal that i have brought forth is fully paid for guthrie senator sanders i will give you 10 seconds just to ask the answer the very direct question will you raise taxes for the middle class in a sanders administration sanders people who have healthcare under medicare for all will have no premiums no deductibles no copayments no out of expe out of pocket expenses yes they will pay more in taxes but less in healthcare for what they get guthrie thank you senator bennet senator sanders guthrie senator senator bennet we re going to get to everybody biden i d like to say biden addresses income inequality guthrie senator biden promise everyone s going to get in here promise sen vice president biden senator sanders as you know has been calling for revolution recently in remarks to a group of wealthy donors as you were speaking about the problem of income inequality in this country you said we shouldn t quote demonize the rich you said nobody has to be punished no one s standard of living would change nothing would fundamentally change what did you mean by that biden what i meant by that is look donald trump thinks wall street built america ordinary middle class americans built america my dad used to have an expression he said joe a job is about a lot more than a paycheck it s about your dignity it s about respect it s being able to look your kid in the eye and say everything s going to be okay too many people who are in the middle class and poor have had the bottom fall out under this proposal what i am saying is that we ve got to be straightforward we have to make sure we understand that to return dignity to the middle class they have to have insurance that is covered and they can afford it they have to make sure that we inaudible situation where there s continuing education and they are able to pay for it and they have to make sure that they are able to breathe air that is is is clean and they they have water that they can drink look donald trump has put us in a horrible situation we do have enormous income inequality and one thing i agree honestly can make massive cuts in the 1 6 trillion in tax loopholes out there and i would be going about eliminating donald trump s tax cuts for the wealthy guthrie vice president biden thank you sen harris on whether candidates should explain how to pay for their proposals senator harris there s a lot of talk in this primary about new government benefits such as student loan cancellation free college healthcare and more do you think that democrats have a responsibility to explain how they will pay for every proposal guthrie they make along those lines harris well let me tell you something i i hear that question but where was that question when the republicans and donald trump passed a tax bill that that benefits the top 1 percent and the biggest corporations in the this country contributing at least a 1 trillion to the debt of america which middle class families will pay for one way or another working families need support and need to be lifted up and frankly this economy is not working or working people for too long the rules have been written in the favor of the people who have the most and not in favor of the people who work the most which why i am proposing that we change the tax code so for every family that is making less than 100 000 year they will receive a tax credit that they can collect up to 500 a month which will make all the difference between those families being able to get through the end of the month with dignity and was support or not and on day one i will repeal that tax bill that benefits the top 1 percent and the biggest corporations in america candidates are asked about socialism guthrie senator harris thank you governor hickenlooper let me get you in on this you ve warned that democrats will lose in 2020 if they embrace socialism as you put it you were booed at the california democratic convention when you said that only one candidate on this stage senator sanders identifies himself as a democratic socialist what are the policies or positions of your opponents that you think are veering towards socialism hickenlooper well i think that the bottom line is if we don t clearly define that we are not socialists the republicans are going to come at us every way they can and and call us socialists and if you look at the green new deal which i admire the sense of urgency and how important it is to do climate change i m a scientist but we can t promise every american a government job if you want to get universal healthcare coverage i believe that healthcare is a right and not a privilege but you can t expect to eliminate private insurance for 180 million people many of whom don t want to give it up in colorado we brought businesses and nonprofits together we got to near universal healthcare coverage we were the first state in america to to bring the environmental community and the oil and gas industry to address aggressively address methane emissions and we were also the first place to to expand reproductive rights on a scale basis that we reduced teen pregnancy by 54 percent we ve done the big progressive things people said it couldn t be done i ve done what pretty much everyone else up here is still talking about doing guthrie governor thank you senator sanders i ll give you a chance to to weigh in here what is your response to those who say nominating a a socialist would reelect donald trump sanders well i think the responses at the polls last poll i saw had us 10 points ahead of donald trump because the american people understand that trump is a phony that trump is a pathological liar and a racist and then he lied to the american people during his campaign he said he was going to stand up for working families well president trump you re not standing up for working families when you try to throw 32 million people off the healthcare that they have and that 83 percent of your tax benefits go to the top 1 percent that s how we be trump we expose him for the fraud that he is gillibrand in answer guthrie senator gillibrand i want to talk about guthrie senator gillibrand 30 seconds gillibrand i disagree with both their perspectives the debate we re having in our party right now is confusing because the truth is there s a big difference between capitalism on the one hand and greed on the other and so all the things that we re trying to change is when companies care more about profits when they do about people so if you re talking about ending gun violence it s the greed of the nra and the gun manufacturers that make any progress impossible it s the greed of the insurance companies and the drug companies when we want to try to get healthcare as a right and not a privilege guthrie senator gillibrand gillibrand so there may guthrie thank you gillibrand not be disagreement in the party because in truth we want healthy capitalism guthrie senator thank you gillibrand we don t want corrupted capitalism guthrie thank you i want to be fair to all the candidates gillibrand which is the definition of greed guthrie thank you senator bennet you have said it s possible to write policy proposals that have no basis in reality you might as well call them candy were you referring to any candidate or proposal in particular when you said that bennet are you was that directed to me guthrie yes that was your quote bennet well thank you that sounded like me thank you guthrie it was you bennet i appreciate it well gillibrand it definitely wasn t me bennet look first of all i agree completely with bernie about what the fundamental challenge we re facing as a country is 40 years of no economic growth for 90 percent of the american people one hundred and sixty thousand families in the top 1 percent have the same wealth as the bottom 90 percent and we got the worst income inequality that we ve had in 100 years where i disagree is on his solution on medicare for all you know i i have proposed getting to universal healthcare which we need to do it is a right healthcare is a right bennet we need to get to personal healthcare i believe the way to do that is by finishing the work we started with obamacare and creating a public option that every family and every person in america can make a choice for their family about whether they want a public option which for them would be like having medicare for all or whether they want to keep their private insurance i believe we will get there much more quickly if we do that bennet if i could just finish bernie mentioned that the taxes that we would have to pay because of those taxes vermont rejected medicare for all bennet in bernie s bill in bernie s bill i wrote guthrie we are going to talk about healthcare at length senator but at the moment my colleague gillibrand in senator sanders bill i wrote the part in senator sanders bill that is the transition that merges what the two senators said holt senator gillibrand the truth is if you have a buy in over a four or five year period you move us to single payer more quickly diaz balart senator we will get to this we will get to this bennet can i can i just say buttigieg on why he doesn t support free college diaz balart before we do i want to say hello and good evening buenos noches to mayor buttigieg buttigieg untranslated diaz balart untranslated many of your colleagues on stage support free college you do not why not buttigieg sure so college affordability is personal for us chasten and i have six figure student debt i believe in reducing student debt it s logical to me that if you can refinance your house you ought to be able to refinance your student debt i also believe in free college for low and middle income students for whom cost could be a barrier i just don t believe it makes sense to ask working class families to subsidize even the children of billionaires i think the children of the wealthiest americans can pay at least a little bit of tuition and while i want want tuition costs to go down i don t think we can buy down every last penny for that now there s something else that doesn t get talked about in the college affordability debate yes it needs to be more affordable in this country to go to college it also needs to be more affordable in this country to not go to college you should be able to live well afford rent be generous to your children inaudible little league whether you went to college or not that s one of many reasons we need to raise the minimum wage to at least 15 00 an hour rep swalwell and biden on generational change and yang explains his economic plan swalwell i got 100 000 in student loan debt myself i tell you if i count on the people who have been in government for the past 30 years who were around when this problem was created to be the ones to solve it it is going to be the next generation the 40 million of us who can t start a family can t take a good idea and start a business and can t buy our first home this is the generation that s going to be able to solve student loan debt this generation is ready to lead diaz balart mr mr yang your signature policy is to give every adult in the united states 1 000 a month no questions asked yang that s right diaz balart i think that s like 3 2 trillion a a year how would you do that yang i m sorry diaz balart oh so it s difficult to do if you have companies like amazon trillion dollar tech companies paying literally 0 in taxes while they re closing 30 percent of our stores now we need to put the american people in a position to benefit from all of these innovations in other parts of the economy and if we had a value added tax at even half the european level it would generate over 800 billion in new revenue which combined with the money in our hands it would be the trickle up economy from our people families and communities up we would spend the money and circulate through our regional economies and neighborhoods creating millions of jobs making our families stronger and healthier we d save money on things like incarceration homelessness services emergency room healthcare and just the value gains from having a stronger healthier mentally healthier population would increase gdp by 700 billion this is the move we have to make particularly as technology is now automating away millions of american s jobs why donald trump is our president today that we automated away 400 million manufacturing jobs in michigan ohio and pennsylvania and wisconsin and we re about to do the same thing to millions of retail jobs call center jobs fast food jobs truck driving jobs on and on throughout the economy diaz balart so i get to understand you a little better so you re saying 1 000 a month for everyone over 18 but a value added tax so you can spend that 1000 on value added tax yang well the value added tax what it would end up you would still be increasing the buying power of the bottom 94 percent of americans you have to spend a lot of money for a mild value add tax to eat up 12 000 a year per individual so for the average family with two or three adults it would 24 to 36 000 a year diaz balart ok so congressman swalwell want to talk a little bit about what mr yang is talking about and you just actually mentioned it many americans are worried about things like self driving cars robots drones artificial intelligence will cost them their jobs what would you to help people get the skills they need to adapt to this new world swalwell we must always be a country where technology creates more jobs than swalwell displaces and i ve seen the anxiety across america where the manufacturing floors go from 1 000 to 100 to one so we have to modernize our schools value the teachers who prepare our kids wipe the student debt from any teacher that goes into a community that needs it invest in america s communities especially where places where the best exports are people who move away to get skills but jose i was six years old when a presidential candidate came to the california democratic convention and said it s time to pass the torch to a new generation of americans that candidate was then senator joe biden joe biden was right when he said it was time the pass the torch to a new generation of americans 32 years ago he s still right today if we re going to solve the issues of automation ph pass the torch if we re going to solve the issues of climate chaos pass the torch if we re going to solve the issue of student loan debt pass the torch if we re going to end gun violence for families who are fearful of sending their kids to school pass the torch diaz balart vice president would you like to sing a torch song biden i would i m still holding on to that torch i want to make it clear to you look the fact of the matter is what we have to do is make sure that everybody is prepared better to go on to educate for an education the fact is that that s why i propose us focusing on schools that are in distress that s why i think we should triple the amount of money we spend for title i schools that s why i think we should have universal pre k that s why i think every single person who graduates from high school 65 out of 100 now need something beyond high school and we should provide for them to be able to get that education that s why there should be free community college cutting in half the cost of college that s why we should be in the position where we do not have anyone have to pay back the student debt when they get out they re making less than 25 000 a year their debt is frozen no interest payment until they get beyond that we can t put people in a position where they aren t able to go on and move on and so folks there s a lot we can do but we have to make continuing education available for everyone so that everyone can compete in the 21st century we re not doing that now diaz balart senator senator buttigieg as the youngest as the youngest guy on the stage i feel like i probably ought to contribute to the generation gillibrand before before sanders as part of joe s generation gillibrand i m for buttigieg i m all for gillibrand before we move on sanders as part of joe s generation gillibrand before before we move sanders let me respond the issue if i may say harris before we move on from education sanders is not generational diaz balart let s please please unknown yeah diaz balart senators senators unknown yeah harris we forgive crosstalk sanders the issue is who has the guts unknown inaudible comment sanders to take on wall street to take on the fossil fuel industry to take on the big money interest who have unbelievable influence over the economic and political life of this country swalwell these issues inaudible sanders that s the issue diaz balart senator harris senator harris diaz balart senator harris i m so sorry gillibrand can i have a turn diaz balart we will let all of these things senator harris we will let you all speak senator harris unknown been part of the issue unknown wait for evolution on these issues sen harris food fight moment harris hey guys you know what america does not want to witness a food fight they want to know how we re going to put food on their table so on that point part of the issue that is at play in america today and we ve all been traveling around the country i certainly have i m meeting people who are working two and three jobs you know this president walks around talking about and flouting his great economy right my great economy my great economy you ask him well how are you measuring this greatness of this economy of yours and he talks about the stock market well that s fine if you own stocks so many families in america do not you ask him how are you measuring the greatness of this economy of yours and they point to the jobless numbers and the unemployment numbers well yeah people in america are working they re working two and three jobs so when we talk about jobs let s be very clear in our america no one should have to work more than one job to have a roof over their head and food on the table diaz balart thank you very much senator yes holt you have all you ve all expressed an interest in talking about healthcare so let s williamson i d like to say something else candidates weigh in on healthcare holt let s let s talk about healthcare and this is going to be a show of hands question we asked a question about healthcare last night that spurred a lot of discussion as you know we re going to do it again now many people watching at home have health insurance of their employer who here would abolish their private health insurance in favor of a government run plan all right kirsten gill gillibrand senator gillibrand unknown can i gillibrand yeah so now it s my turn holt go ahead gillibrand so this is a very important issue so the plan that senator sanders and i and other support medicare for all is how you get to single payer but it has a buy in transition period which is really important in 2005 when i ran for congress in a two to one republican district i actually ran on medicare for all and i won that two to one republican district twice and the way i formulated it was simple anyone who doesn t have access to insurance they like they could buy it in a percentage of income they could afford so that s what we put into the transition period for our medicare for all plan i believe we need to get to universal healthcare as a right not a privilege to single payer the quickest way you get there is you create competition with the insurers god bless the insurers if they want to compete they can certainly try but they d never put people over their profits and i doubt they ever will so what will happen is people will choose medicare you will transition we would get to medicare for all and then your step to single payer is so short i would make it an earned benefit just like social security so that you buy in your whole life it is always there for you and it s permanent and it s universal holt senator your time is up i want to put that same question to mayor buttigieg buttigieg yeah we ve taught look everybody who says medicare for all every person in politics who allows that phrase to escape their lips has a responsibility to explain how you re actually supposed to get from here to there now here s how i would do it it s very similar i would call it medicare for all who want it you take something like medicare a flavor of that and you make it available on the exchanges it people can buy in and then if people like us are right that that will be not only a more inclusive plan but a more efficient plan than any of the corporate answers out there then it will be a very natural glide path to the single payer environment but let s remember even in countries that have outright socialized medicine like england even there there s still a private sector that s fine it s just that for our primary care we can t be relying on the tender verses of the corporate system this one is very personal for me i started out this year dealing with a terminal illness of my father i make decisions for a living and nothing could have prepared me for the kind of decisions our family faced but the thing we had going for us was that we never had to make those decisions based on whether it was gonna bankrupt our family because of medicare and i want every holt time buttigieg and i want every family to have that same freedom to do what is medically right not inaudible holt your time is complete vice president biden i want to put the question to you you were an ar one of the architects of obama care so where do we go from here biden look this is a very personal to me when my wife and daughter were killed in an automobile accident my two boys were really very badly injured i couldn t imagine what it d be like had i not had adequate healthcare available immediately and then when my son came home from iraq after a year he was diagnosed with terminal cancer and he was given months to live i can t fathom what would have happened if in fact they said by the way the last six months of your life you re on your own we re cutting off you ve used up your time the fact of the matter is that the quickest fastest way to do it is build on obama care to build on what we did and secondly secondly to make sure that everyone does have an option everyone whether they have private insurance employer insurance or no insurance they in fact can buy into the exchange to a medicare like plan and the way you do that you can do it quicker look urgency matters there s people right now facing what i ve faced and what we ve faced without any of the help i had we must move now i m against any democrat who opposes in fact holt vice president biden your time is biden takes down obama care and any republican who wants to get rid of it holt let me let me turn to senator sanders senator sanders you have basically you basically want to scrap the private health insurance system as we know it and replace it with a government run plan none of the states that have tried something like that california vermont new york has struggled with it have been successful if politicians can t make it work in those states how would you implement it on a national level how does this work sanders lester i find it hard to believe that every other major country on earth including my neighbor 50 miles north of me canada somehow has figured out a way to provide healthcare to every man woman and child and in most cases they re spending 50 percent per capita of what we are spending let s be clear let us be very clear the function of healthcare today from the insurance and drug company perspective is not to provide quality care to all in a cost effective way the function of the healthcare system today is to make billions in profits for the insurance companies and last year if you could believe it while we paid the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs and i will lower prescription drug prices in half in this country top ten companies made 69 billion in profit they will spend 100 s of millions of dollars lying to the american people telling us why we cannot have a holt senator sanders medicare for all holt i just have to follow up there how do you implement it on a national level sanders i m sorry holt how do you implement it on a national level given the fact that it s not succeeded in other states that have tried sanders i will tell you how we ll do it we ll do it the way real change has always taken place whether it was the labor movement the civil rights movement or the women s movement sanders we will have medicare for all when tens of millions of people are prepared to stand up and tell the insurance companies and the drug companies that their day is gone that healthcare is a human right not something to make huge profits off of holt all right ms williamson ms williamson this is a question for you holt excuse me excuse me i am addressing the question to ms williamson we have been talking a lot about access to health insurance but for many americans their most pressing concern is the high cost of healthcare how would you lower the cost of prescription drugs williamson well first of all the government should never have made the deal with the big farm at that they couldn t negotiate that was just part of the regular corruption by which multinational corporations have their way with us you know i wanted to say that while i agree with i i m with senator bennet and others but i agree with almost everything here i will tell you one thing it s really nice if we got all these plans but if you think we are going to beat donald trump by just having all of these plans you ve got another thing coming because he didn t when by saying he had a plan he won by simply saying make america great again we ve got to get deeper than just the superficial fixes as important as they are even if we are just talking about the superficial fixes ladies and gentlemen we don t have a health care system in the united states we have a sickness care system in the united states we just wait until somebody gets sick and then we talk about who s going to pay for the treatment and how they are going to be treated what we need to talk about is why so many americans have unnecessary chronic illnesses so many more compared to other countries and that gets back into not just the big pharma not just health insurance companies it has to do with chemical policies it has to do with environmental policies holt all right ms williamson your time williamson it has to do with food policies it has to do with drug policies holt thank you williamson it even has to do with environmental policies holt thank you senator senator bennet a question for you do you want to keep a system that we have in place with obamacare and build on it you mentioned that a moment ago is that enough to get us to universal coverage bennet i believe that will get us the quickest way there and i bought the vice president was very moving about this and mayor pete as well i had prostate cancer recently as you may know and that is why i was a little late getting in the race these same week my kid had her appendectomy out and i feel very strongly that families ought to be able to have this choice i think that is what the american people want i believe it will get us there quickly there are millions of people in america that do not have health insurance today because they can t they are too wealthy wealthy they make too much money to be on medicaid they can t afford health insurance when senator sanders says that canada is single payer there are 35 million people in canada there are 330 million people in the united states easily the number of people on a public option it could easily be 35 million and for them it would be medicare for all as mayor buttigieg says but for others that want to keep it they should be able to keep it and i think that will be the fastest way to get where we need to go also i will say bernie is a very honest person he has said over and over again unlike others that have supported this legislation over and over again that this will band making it illegal all insurance except cosmetic except insurance for i guess that s where plastic surgery everything else is banned under the medicare for all proposal holt i i let i let you go a little long there but i want but obviously senator sanders you have got a response harris i would like to add a point here holt senator sanders inaudible sanders just very briefly you know mike medicare is the most popular bennet i agree sanders health insurance program in the country people don t like their private insurance companies they like their doctors and hospitals under our plan people go to any doctor they want any hospital they want we will substantially lower the cost of healthcare in this country because we will stop the greed of the insurance companies and the drug companies harris on this issue on this issue we have to think about how this affects real people unknown inaudible lifetime inaudible for all and today harris the reality of how this affects real people is captured in a story that many of us heard and i will para paraphrase there is in the unite america a parent who is seeing that their child has a temperature that is out of control calls 911 what should i do and they say take the child to the emergency room and so they get in their car and they drive and there sitting in the parking lot outside of the emergency room looking at those sliding glass doors while they have the hand on the four head of their child knowing that if they walk through those sliding glass doors even though they have insurance they will be out 5000 deductible 5000 deductible when they walk through those doors holt senator senator harris that is what insurance companies are doing in america today guthrie we re going to continue this discussion swalwell i m one of those parents guthrie i wanted to put it in guthrie candidates please swalwell i m one of those parents i was just in the emergency room with my eight month old guthrie candidates please swalwell i m one of those parents i was just in the emergency room and i m telling you guthrie congressman thank you swalwell we fight health insurance companies every single week guthrie thank you swalwell we stand in line and pay expensive prescription drugs we have to have a healthcare guarantee if you re sick you re seen it and in america you never go broke because of it guthrie okay gillibrand with all due respect guthrie a lot of you have been talking tonight about these government healthcare plans that you proposed in one form or another this is a show of hands question and hold them up for a moment so people can see raise your hand if if your government plan would provide coverage for undocumented immigrants guthrie okay let me start with you mayor buttigieg why mayor buttigieg why buttigieg because our country is healthier when everybody is healthier and remember we re talking about something people are getting a given a chance to buy into in the same way that there are undocumented immigrants in my community who pay they pay sales taxes they pay property taxes directly or indirectly this is not about a handout this is an insurance program and we do ourselves no favor by having 11 million undocumented people in our country be unable to access healthcare but of course the real problem is we shouldn t have 11 million undocumented people with no pathway to citizenship it makes no sense and the american people the american people agree on what to do this is the crazy thing if leadership consists of of forming a consensus around a divisive issue this white house has divided us around a consensus issue the american people want a pathway to citizenship they wanted protections for dreamers we need to clean up the lawful immigration system like how my father immigrated to this country and as part of a compromise we can do whatever commonsense measures are needed at the border guthrie mayor buttigieg but washington can t deliver on something the american people want what does that tell you about the system we re living in it tells you it needs profound guthrie mayor thank you buttigieg structural reform guthrie vice president biden i believe you said that your health care plan would not cover undocumented immigrants could you explain your position biden i m sorry i beg your pardon i didn t hear guthrie i believe at the show of hands you did not raise her hand did you raise your hand biden oh no i did i but guthrie okay sorry sorry i so you said that they would be covered under your plan biden yes guthrie which is different than obama care biden yes but here here s the thing guthrie can you explain that change biden yes you cannot let as the mayor said you cannot let people who are sick no matter where they come from no matter what their status go uncovered you can t do that it s just going to be taking care of period you have to it s the humane thing to do but here s the deal the deal is that he s right about three things number one they in fact contribute to the well being of the country but they also for example they ve increased the lifespan of social security because they re they have a job they re paying the social security tax that s what they re doing it s increase the lifespan they would do the same thing in terms of reducing the overall cost of healthcare by them being able to be treated and not wait until there in extremis the other thing is folks look we can deal with these insurance companies we can deal with insurance companies by number one putting insurance executives in jail for their misleading their misleading advertising what they re doing on opioids what they re doing paying doctors to prescribe we should we could be doing this by making sure everyone who is on medicare that the government should be able to negotiate the price for what whatever the drug costs are we can do this by making sure that we re in a position that we in fact allow people you mean time s up williamson i just want to address guthrie your time s up vice president biden thank you holt actually you can hold off a minute we need to take a short break here we got a lot more we need to talk to all of you about so stick with us we re just getting started we ll be back with more from miami right after this candidates on how they would address undocumented immigrants diaz balart thank you very much senator harris last month more than 130 000 migrants were apprehended at the southern border many of them are being detained including small children in private detention centers in florida and throughout our countries most of the candidates on this stage say the conditions in these facilities are abhorrent on january 20th 2021 if you are president what specifically would you do with the thousands of people harris yeah diaz balart who try to reach the united states every day and want a better life through asylum harris immediately on january 20th of 2021 i will first of all we cannot forget our daca recipients so i m going to start there i will immediately by executive action reinstate daca status and daca protection to those young people i will further extend protection for deferral of deportation for their parents and for veterans who we have so many who are undocumented and who have served our country and fought for our democracy i will also immediately put in place immediate process for reviewing the cases for asylum i will release children from cages i will get rid of the private detention centers and i will ensure that the this microphone that the president of the united states holds in her hand is use din a way that is about reflecting the values of our country and not about locking children up separating them from their parents and i have to just say that we have to think about this issue in terms of real people a mother who pays a coyote to transport her child through their country of origin through the entire country of mexico facing unknown peril to come here why would that mother do that i will tell you because she has decided for that child to remain where they are is worse but what does donald trump do he says go back to where you came from that is not reflective of our america and our values and it has got to end diaz balart hickenlooper day one if you are day one at the white house how do you respond williamson with these with these children diaz balart let me get to you in in in just a second williamson i m sorry diaz balart governor day one thousands of men women and children cross the border asking for asylum for a better life what do you do one day one hour one hickenlooper certainly the images we ve seen this week just compound the emotional impact that the world is judging us by if you had ever told me any time in my life that this country would sanction federal agents to take children from the arms of their parents put them in cages actually put them up for adoption in colorado we call that kidnapping i i would have called you i would have told you it was unbelievable and the first thing we have to do is recognize the humanitarian crisis on the border for what it is and make sure there are the sufficient facil facilities in place so that women and children are not separated from their families the children are with their families we have to make sure that that ice is completely reformed and they begin looking at their job in a humanitarian way where they are addressing the whole needs of the people that they are engaged with along the border and we have to make sure ultimately that we provide not just shelter but food clothing and access to medical care diaz balart ms williamson williamson yes what donald trump has done to these children and it s not just in colorado governor you re right it is kidnapping and it s extremely important for us to realize that if you forcibly take a child from their parents arms you are kidnapping them and if you take a lot of children and you put them in a detainment center thus inflicting chronic trauma upon them that s called child abuse this is collective child abuse williamson this is collective child abuse and when this is crime both of those things are a crime and if your government does it that doesn t make it less of a crime these are state sponsored crimes and what president and what president trump has done is not only attack these children not only demonize these immigrants he is attacking a basic principle of america s moral core we open our hearts to the stranger this is extremely important and it s also important for all of us remember and i have great respect for everyone who is on this on this on this stage but we are going to talk about what to do about healthcare well where have you been guys because if it s not just the matter of a plan and i haven t heard anybody on this stage who has talked about american foreign policy in latin america and how we might have in the last few decades contributed to something being more helpful sp diaz balart senator gillibrand what would you do as president with a reality gillibrand well one of the worst things about president trump that he has done to this country is he has torn apart the moral fabric of who we are when he started separating children at the border from their parents the fact that seven children have died in his custody the fact that dozens of children have been separated from their parents and they have no plan to reunite them so i would do a few things first i would fight for comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship second i would reform how we treat asylum seekers at the border i would have a community based treatment center where you are doing it within the communities where asylum seekers are given lawyers where there is real immigration judges not employees of the atty gen but appointed for life and have a community based system i would fund borders security but the worst thing president trump has done is he has diverted the funds away from cross border terrorism cross border human trafficking drug trafficking and gun trafficking and he is given that money to the for profit prisons i would not be spending money in for profit prisons diaz balart we had gillibrand to lock up children and asylum seekers diaz balart we had a very spirited debate on this stage last night on the topic of decriminalization of the border if if you would be so kind raise your hand if you think it should be a civil offense rather than a crime to cross the border without documentation can we keep the hands up so we can see them buttigieg let s remember that s not just a theoretical exercise that criminalization that is the basis for family separation you do away with that it is no longer possible of course it wouldn t be possible anyway in my presidency because it is dead wrong we have got to talk about one other thing because the republican party likes to cloak itself in the language of religion now our party doesn t talk about that as much largely for a very good reason which was we are committed to the separation of church and state and we stand for people of any religion and people of no religion but we should call out hypocrisy when we see it in for a party that associates itself with christianity to say that it is okay to suggest that god would smile on the division of families at the hands of federal agents that god would condone putting children in cages has lost all claim to ever use religious language again diaz balart mr vice president i don t know if you raised your hand or word just asking to speak biden look diaz balart would you decriminalize crossing the border without documents biden the first thing i would do is unite families i would surge immediately billions of dollars worth of help to the region the immediately look i talk about foreign policy i am the guy that got a bipartisan agreement at the very end of the campaign at the very end of our term to spend 740 million to deal with the problem and that was to go to the root cause of why people are leaving in the first place it was working we saw as you know a net decrease in the number of children who were coming the crisis was updated and along came this president and he said he immediately discontinued that we all talk about these things i did it i did it 740 now look second thing second thing we have to do the law now requires the reuniting of those families we would reunite those families period and if not we would put those children in a circumstance where they were safe until we could find their parents and lastly the idea that he is in court with his justice department saying children in cages do not need a bed do not need a blanket do not need a toothbrush diaz balart vice president biden that is outrageous diaz balart the obama biden administration was the obama biden administration deported more than three million americans my question to you is if an individual is living in the united states of america without documents and that is his only offense should that person be deported biden depending if they committed a a major crime they should be deported and the president was left in his president obama i think did a heck of a job to compare him to what what this guy is doing is absolutely i find close to immoral but the fact is that look we should not be locking people up we should be making sure we change the circumstance as we did why they would leave in the first place and those who come seeking asylum we should immediately have the capacity to absorb them keep them safe until they can be heard diaz balart a 15 second if you could if you wish to answer should someone who is here without documents and that is his only offense should that person be deported biden that person should not be the focus of deportation we should fundamentally change the way we deal with things diaz balart senator sanders i want to williamson i think it s important sanders suggest that i agree with a lot of what kamala just said and that is on day one we take out our executive order pen and we rescind every damn thing on this issue that trump has done number two number two picking up on the point that joe made we got a look at the root causes and you have a situation where honduras among other things is a failing state massive corruption you got gangs who are telling families that if a 10 year old does not join their gang their family is going to be killed what we have got to do on day one and invite the presidents and the leadership of central america and mexico together this is a hemispheric diaz balart thank you sanders problem that we have got to address diaz balart congressman swalwell what do you do swalwell day one diaz balart no if someone is here without documents and that is their only offense is that person to be deported swalwell no that person can be a part of this great american experience that person can contribute my congressional district is one of the most diverse in america and we see the benefits when people contribute and they become a part of the community and they re not in the shadow economy day one for me families are reunited this president though for immigrants there is nothing he will not do two separate a family cage a child or erase their existence by weaponizing the census and there is nothing that we cannot do in the courts and that i will not do as president to reverse that and to make sure that families always belong together diaz balart senator harris harris well thank you i will say no absolutely not they should not be deported and i actually this was one of the very few issues with which i disagreed with the administration with whom i otherwise had a great relationship and a great deal of respect but on the secure communities issue i was attorney general of california i led the second largest department of justice in the united states second only to the united states department of justice in a state of 40 million people and on this issue i disagreed with my president because the policy was to allow deportation of people who by ice s own definition were non criminals so as attorney general and the chief law officer of the state of california i issued a directive to the sheriffs of my state that they did not have to comply with detainers and instead should make decisions based on the best interest of public safety of their community because what i saw and i was tracking it every day i was tracking it and saw that that parents people who had not committed a crime even by ice s own definition were being deported and but i have to add a point here the problem with this kind of policy and i know it as a prosecutor diaz balart senator harris i want a rape victim to be able to run in the middle diaz balart senator harris of a to run in the middle of the street and waved down a police officer and report the crime against her i want anybody who has been the victim diaz balart senator harris of any real crime diaz balart senator harris to be able to do that diaz balart your time harris and not be afraid that if they do that diaz balart senator harris they will be deported because the abuser diaz balart senator harris will tell them it is they who is the criminal it is wrong holt we re going to turn harris it is wrong holt we re going to turn to the issue of trade now if we can holt last night we ask the candidates on this stage to name the greatest geopolitical threat facing the u s four of them mentioned china u s businesses say china steals our intellectual property and party leaders on both sides accuse china of manipulating their currency to keep the cost of goods artificially low i ll ask this to senator bennet to start off with how would you stand up to china bennet i think that first of all the biggest the biggest threat to our national security right now is russia not china and second on china we ve got comp because of what they ve done with our election in china i think the president s been right to push back on china but he s done it in completely the wrong way we should mobilize the entire rest of the world who all have a shared interest in pushing back on china s mercantilist trade policies and i think we can do that i d like to answer the other question before this as well holt you you have the time bennet when i when i when i see these kids at the border i see my mom because i know she sees herself because she was separated from her parents for years during the holocaust in poland and for donald trump to be doing what he s doing to children and their families at the borders i say this as somebody who wrote the immigration bill in 2013 that created a pathway to citizenship for 11 million people in this country that had the most progressive dream act that s ever been conceived much less passed it got 68 votes in the senate that had 46 billion of border security in it that was sophisticated 21st century border security not a medieval wall that the president has holt senator the time sorry bennet turned the border of the united states into a symbol of nativist hostility that the whole world is looking at when what we should be represented by is holt senator thank you bennet the statue of liberty which has brought my parents to this country to begin with we need to make a change yang and mayor buttigieg on concerns about china holt mr yang let me bring you in on this on the issue of china you ve expressed also of concerns about technology and taking jobs are you worried about china and if so how would you stand up against it yang well i just want to agree that i think russia is our biggest geopolitical threat because they ve been hacking our democracy successfully they ve been laughing their asses off about it for the last couple of years and we should focus on that before we start worrying about other threats now china they do they do inaudible property it s a massive problem but the tariffs and the trade war are just punishing businesses and producers and workers on both sides i met with a farmer in iowa who said he spent six years building up a buying relationship in china that s now disappeared and gone forever and the beneficiaries have not been american workers or or people in china it s been southeast asia and other producers that have then stepped into the void so we need to to crack down on chinese malfeasance in the trade relationship but the tariffs and the trade war are the wrong way to go holt how would you stand up against china buttigieg yeah i mean first of all we ve got to recognize that the china challenge really is a serious one this is not something to dismiss or wave away and if you look at what china is doing they re using technology for the perfection of dictatorship but their fundamental economic model isn t gonna change because of some tariffs i live in the industrial midwest folks who aren t in the shadow of a factory or somewhere near a soy field where i live and manufacturers and especially soy farmers are hurting tariffs are taxes and americans are gonna pay on average 800 more a year because of these tariffs meanwhile china is investing so that they could soon be able to run circles around us in artificial intelligence and this president is fixated on the china relationship as if all that mattered was the export balance on dishwashers we ve got a much bigger issue on our hands but in a moment when their authoritarian model is being held up as an alternative to ours because ours looks so chaotic compared to theirs right now because of our internal divisions the biggest thing we ve got to do is invest in our own domestic competitiveness if we disinvest holt all right mayor thank you buttigieg in our own infrastructure education we are never gonna be able to compete and if we really want to be an alternative a democratic alternative we actually have to demonstrate that we care about democratic values holt mayor thank you thank you for your answer buttigieg at home guthrie so far we re gonna take a quick break here candidates when we come back the questioning continues about college chuck todd and rachel maddow will be here much more with our candidates straight ahead chuck todd and rachel maddow take over without major technical difficulties holt welcome back to the presidential democratic debates at our center in miami guthrie as we bring in the questioning we want to bring in more members of our team diaz balart so let s turn over to chuck todd and rachel maddow todd rachel i had a dream that we ve done this before maddow no todd no maddow no this is definitely the first time todd definitely the first time thank you lester savannah and jose let s recap the rules one more time 20 candidates qualified for this first debate we heard from 10 of them from last night we are hearing from 10 more tonight breakdown for each night was selected at random candidates will have 60 seconds to answer direct questions 30 seconds for follow ups if necessary maddow because of this large field of candidates not every person will be able to comment on everything but the less audience reaction there is the more time they will all get mayor buttigieg speaks out on civil rights and the shooting in his hometown over the course of the next hour we will hear from all of these candidates we are going to begin this hour with mayor buttigieg in the last five years civil rights activists in our country have led a national debate over race and the criminal justice system your community of south bend indiana has recently been in uproar over an officer involved shooting the police force in south bend is now 6 percent black in a city that is 26 percent black why has that not improved over your two terms as mayor buttigieg because i couldn t get it done my community is in anguish right now because of an officer involved shooting a black man eric logan killed by a white officer and i m not allowed to take sides until the investigation comes back the officer says he was attacked with a knife but he didn t have his body camera on it s a mess and we re hurting and i could walk you through all of the things that we have done as a community all of the steps that we took from bias training to de escalation but it didn t save the life of eric logan and when i look into his mother s eyes i have to face the fact and nothing that i say will bring him back this is an issue that is facing our community and so many communities around the country and until we move policing out from the shadow of systemic racism whatever this particular incident teaches us we will be left with the bigger problem of the fact that there is a wall of mistrust put up one racist act at a time not just from what has happened in the past but what s happening around the country in the present it threatens the well being of every community and i am determined to bring about a day when a white person driving a vehicle and a black person driving a vehicle when they see a police officer approaching feels the exact same thing a feeling not of fear but of safety i m determined to bring that day about maddow thank you mr mayor hickenlooper mayor buttigieg mayor buttigieg if i could ask one question because i think maddow governor i ll give you 30 seconds hickenlooper i think that the question they are asking in south bend i think across the country is why is it taking so long we had a shooting when i first became mayor 10 years before ferguson and the community came together and we created an office of the independent monitor civilian oversight commission we diversified the police force in two years we actually did de escalation training i think the real question that america should be asking is why five years after ferguson every city doesn t have this level of police accountability maddow governor hickenlooper thank you hickenlooper we buttigieg i ve got to respond to that look we ve taken so many steps toward police accountability that the fop just denounced me for too much accountability we re obviously not there yet and i accept responsibility for that swalwell inaudible you should fire the chief buttigieg so under indiana law this will be investigated and there will be accountability for the officer involved swalwell but you re the mayor you should fire the chief if that s the policy and someone died williamson all of these issues are extremely important but there are specifics there are symptoms and the underlying cause has to do with deep deep deep realms of racial injustice both in our criminal justice system and in our economic system and the democratic party should be on the side of reparations for slavery for this very reason i do not believe i do not believe that the average american is a racist but the average american is woefully undereducated about the history of race in the united states todd vice president biden we re going to get to you hang on we re going to get harris i would like to say maddow ms williamson thank you very much balart vice president biden i m going to we re going to get to you hang on we re going to get sen harris dramatically confronts biden on his civil rights record harris as we inaudible on this stage i would like to speak harris on the issue of race maddow senator harris harris and so what i will say maddow i will senator harris if i could if i could preface harris is that i agree maddow this we ll give you 30 seconds because we re going to come back to you on on this again in just a moment go for 30 seconds harris okay so on the issue of race i couldn t agree more that this is an issue that is still not being talked about truthfully and honestly i there is not a black man i know be he a relative a friend or a coworker who has not been the subject of some form of profiling or discrimination growing up my sister and i had to deal with the neighbor who told us her parents couldn t play with us because she because we were black and i will say also that that in this campaign we ve also heard and i m going to now direct this to vice president biden i do not believe you are a racist and i agree with you when you commit yourself to the importance of finding common ground biden mm hmm harris but i also believe and it s personal and i i was actually very it was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two united states senators who built their reputations and career on segregation of race in this country and it was not only that but you also worked with them to oppose bussing and you know there was a little girl in california who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools and she was bussed to school every day and that little girl was me so i will tell you that on this subject it cannot be an intellectual debate among democrats we have to take it seriously we have to act swiftly as attorney general of california i was very proud to put in place a a requirement that all my special agents would wear body cameras and keep those cameras on maddow senator harris thank you vice president biden you have been invoked we are going to give you a chance to respond biden that s a mischaracterization of my position across the board i did not praise racists that is not true number one number two if we want to have this campaign litigated on who supports civil rights and whether i did or not i m happy to do that i was a public defender i didn t become a prosecutor i came out and i left a good law firm to become a public defender when in fact when in fact when in fact my city was in flames because of the the assassination of dr king number one now number two as the u s as excuse me as the vice president of the united states i worked with a man who in fact we worked very hard to see to it we dealt with these issues in a major major way the fact is that in terms of busing the busing i never you would ve been able to go to school the same exact way because it was a local decision made by your city council that s fine that s one of the things i argued for that we should not be we should be breaking down these lines but so the bottom line here is look everything i have done in my career i ran because of civil rights i continue to think we have to make fundamental changes in civil rights and those civil rights by the way include not just african americans but the lgbt community they don t harris but vice president biden do you agree today do you agree today that you were wrong to oppose busing in america then biden no harris do you agree biden i did not oppose bussing in america what i opposed is bussing ordered by the department of education that s what i opposed i did not oppose harris well there was a failure of of states to to integrate biden no but harris public schools in america i was part of the second class to integrate berkley california public schools almost two decades after brown v board of education biden because your city council made that decision it was a local decision harris so that s where the federal government must step in biden the the federal government must harris that s why we have the voting rights act and the civil rights act that s why we need to pass the equality act that s why we need to pass the era because there are biden that harris moments in harris history where states fail to preserve the civil rights of all people biden i have supported the era from the very beginning when i ran for inaudible todd vice president biden 30 seconds because i want to bring other people into this biden i i supported the era from the very beginning i am the guy that extended the voting rights act for 25 years we got to the place where we got 98 out of 98 votes in the united states senate doing it i have also argued very strongly that we in fact deal with the notion of denying people access to the ballot box i agree that everybody once they in fact my time is up i m sorry todd thank you vice president harris all of these things inaudible candidates comment on diversity todd senator sanders senator sanders i want to go to you on this you said on the day you launched your campaign that voters should focus on what people stand for not a candidate s race or age or sexual orientation any democrats are very excited by the diversity of this field on this stage and on last night stage and the perspective that diverse city brings to this contest and to these issues are you telling democratic voters that diverse city should it matter when they make this decision sanders no absolutely not unlike the republican party we encourage diverse city we believe in diverse city that is what america is up about but in addition to diversity in terms of having more women more people from the gb l lgbt community we also have to do something else and that is we have to ask ourselves a simple question and that how come to day the worker in the middle of our economy is making no more money than he or she made 45 years ago and that in the last 30 years the top 1 percent has seen a 21 trillion increase in their wealth we need a party that is diverse but we need a party that has the guts to stand up to the powerful special interest who have so much power over the economic and political life of this country todd senator gillibrand i want to give you 30 seconds on this gillibrand well first of all where bernie left off we have heard a lot of good ideas on this stage tonight and a lot of plans but the truth is until you go to the root of the corruption the money in the in politics the fact that washington is run by these special interest you are never going to solve any of these problems i have the most comprehensive approach that experts agree is the most transformative plan to actually take on political corruption to get money out of politics through publicly funded elections to have clean elections if we do that and get money out of politics we can guarantee healthcare as a right not a privilege we can deal with institutional racism we can t take on income inequality and we can take on the corporate corruption that runs washington biden the first constitutional amendment to do that was introduced by me when i was a young senator candidates on bridging the partisan divide and working with mitch mcconnell todd thank thank you vice president i want to shift topics here senator bennet the next question is for you on the issue of partisan gridlock president obama promised in 2012 that after his reelection republicans would want to work with democrats fever would break that did not happen now vice president biden is saying the same thing that if he is elected in 2020 both parties will want to work together should voters believe that somehow if there is a democratic president in 2021 that gridlock is going to magically disappear bennet gridlock will not magically disappear as long as mitch mcconnell is there first second second that is why it is so important for us to when not just the presidency to have somebody that can run in all 50 states but to but to win the senate as well and that is why we have to propose policies that can be supported like medicare x ph so that we can build a broad coalition of americans to overcome broken washington dc i agree with what senator gillibrand was saying and share a lot of her views we need to in gerrymandering in wash and we need to end political gerrymandering in washington the court today said they couldn t do anything about it we need to overturn citizens united the court was the one that gave us citizens united and the attack on voting rights in shelby versus holder is something we need to deal with all of those things has happened since vice president biden was in the senate and we face structural problems that we have to overcome with a broad coalition it s the only way we can do it we need to root out the corruption in washington expand people s right to get to the polls todd time is up thank you bennet and i think then we can succeed todd vice president biden biden can i respond todd thirty seconds i want i what it does sound as if you haven t seen what s been happening in the united states senate over the last 12 years it didn t happen why biden i have seen what happened just sense we were vice president we needed three votes to pass an 800 billion recovery act that kept us from going into depression i got three votes changed we needed to be able to keep the government from shutting down and going bankrupt i got mitch mcconnell to raise taxes 600 billion by raising the top rate and as recently as after the president got elected i was able to put together a coalition on the cures act that billions of dollars go into cancer research bipartisan but sometimes you can t do that sometimes you just have to go out and beat them i went into 20 states over 60 candidates todd okay thank you biden and guess what we beat them we won back the senate bennet chuck chuck todd thank you bennet chuck todd thank you mr bennet the problem with what the vice todd go ahead 30 seconds bennet no what todd yeah 30 seconds go ahead bennet we sometimes you do have to beat them but but the deal that he talked about with mitch mcconnell was a complete victory for the tea party it extended the bush tax cuts permanently the democratic party had been running against that for 10 years we ve lost that economic argument because that deal extended almost all those bush tax cuts permanently and put in place the mindless cuts that we still are dealing with today that are called the sequester that was a great deal for mitch mcconnell biden oh come on bennet it was a terrible deal for america todd thank you thank you senator bennet gillibrand and you heard from republicans todd right right gillibrand you heard from the republicans todd go ahead 30 seconds gillibrand that the reason why the trump tax cut had to be passed is because they had to pay back their donors you heard it they actually said those words so the corruption in washington is real and it is something that makes every one of the plans we ve heard about over the last several months impossible and i have the most comprehensive approach to do it with clean elections publicly funded elections so we restore the power of our democracy into the hands of the voters not into the koch brothers we were talking about issues imagine we re in florida imagine the parkland kids having as much power in our democracy todd thank you gillibrand as the koch brothers or the nra todd thank you senator gillibrand thank you gillibrand imagine their voices carrying farther and wider than todd thank you gillibrand anyone else because their voice is needed todd go ahead senator gillibrand i m trying gillibrand and you can and as president todd to get everyone in here gillibrand it s the first thing i m going todd thank you gillibrand to do because nothing else is possible whether it s education or healthcare or ending institutional racism todd thank you very much right candidates on abortion rights maddow senator sanders i d like to put a different question to you roe versus wade has been the law of the land since 1973 now that there is a conservative majority on the supreme court several republican controlled state have passed laws to severely restrict or even ban abortion one of those laws could very well make it to the supreme court during your presidency if you re elected president what is your plan if row is struck down in the court while your president sanders well my plan is somebody who believes for a start that a woman s right to control her own body is a constitutional right that government and politicians should not infringe on that right we will do everything we can to defense our roe versus wade second of all let me make let me make let me make a promise here you asked about litmus test my litmus test is i will never appoint any nominate any justice to the supreme court unless that justice is 100 percent clear he or she will defend roe v wade third of all i do not believe in packing the court sanders right now but i do believe that constitutionally we have the power to rotate judges to other courts and that brings in new blood into the supreme court and a majority i hope that will understand that a woman has the right to control her own body and that corporations cannot run the united states of america maddow senator maddow i m going to give you 10 additional seconds because inaudible what if the court has already overturned roe and roe is gone all of the things you have described would be to try to preserve roe if roe was gone what could you do as president to preserve abortion rights sanders well first of all let me tell you this didn t come up yet but let s face this medicare for all guarantees every woman in this country the right to have an abortion if she wants it maddow thank you senator gillibrand and can i just address this for a second and i and i want to talk directly directly to america s women and to men who love them women s reproductive rights are under assault by president trump and the republican party thirty states are trying to overturn roe v wade right now and it is mind boggling to me that we are debating this on this stage in 2019 among democrats whether women should have access to reproductive rights i think we have to stop playing defense and start playing offense but let me tell you one thing about politics because it goes to the corruption of the deal making when the door is closed negotiations are made there are conversations about women s rights and compromises have been made behind our backs that s how we got to hyde that s how the hyde amendment was created a compromise by leaders of both parties then we have the aca during the aca neg negotiations i had to fight like heck with other women to make sure that contraception wasn t sold down the river or abortion services and so what we need to know is imagine this one question when we beat president trump and mitch mcconnell walks into the oval office god forbid to do negotiations who do you want when that door closes to be sitting behind that desk to fight for women s rights i have been the fiercest advocate for women s reproductive freedom for over a decade maddow thank you gillibrand and i promise you as president todd senator gillibrand when that door closes i will guarantee women s reproductive inaudible no matter what todd thank you thank you candidates on climate todd we re moving to climate we re moving to climate guys senator harris addressing you first on this you live in a state that has been hit by drought wildfires flooding climate change it is a major concern for voters in your state that s pretty obvious obvious of the state as well last night voters heard many of the candidates weigh in on their proposals explain specifically what yours is harris well first of all i don t even call it climate change it s a climate crisis it represents an existential threat to us as a species and the fact that we have a president of the united states who has embraced science fiction over science fact will be to our collective peril i visited while the embers were smoldering the wildfires in california i spoke with firefighters who were in the midst of fighting a fire while their own homes were burning and on this issue it is a it is a critical issue that is about what we must do to confront what is immediate and before us right now that is why i support a green new deal it is why i believe on day one and as president will re enter us in the paris agreement because we have to take these issues seriously and frankly we have a president of the united states we talked about you asked before what is the greatest national security threat to the united states it s donald trump and i m going to tell you why and i m going to tell you why because i agree climate change represents an existential threat he denies the science you want to talk about north korea real threat in terms of nuclear arsenal but what doe she do he embraces kim jong un a dictator harris history where states fail to preserve the civil rights of all people biden i have supported the era from the very beginning when i ran for inaudible todd vice president biden 30 seconds because i want to bring other people into this biden i i supported the era from the very beginning i am the guy that extended the voting rights act for 25 years we got to the place where we got 98 out of 98 votes in the united states senate doing it i have

the same thing that if he is elected in 2020 both parties will want to work together should voters believe that somehow if there is a democratic pres in 2021 that gridlock is going to magically disappear bennet gridlock will not magically disappear as long as mitch mcconnell is there first second second that is why it is so important for us to when not just the presidency to have somebody that can run in all 50 states but to but to win the senate as well and that is why we have to propose policies that can be supported like medicare x so that we can build a broad coalition of americans to overcome broken washington dc i agree with what senator gillibrand was saying and share a lot of her views we need to in gerrymandering in wash and we need to end political gerrymandering in washington biden and new science and technology to be the exporter not only of the green economy but economy that can create millions of jobs but i would immediately rejoin the paris climate accord i would up the ante in that accord which it calls for because we make up 15 percent of the problem 85 percent of the world makes up the rest and so we have to have someone who knows how to corral the rest of the world bring them together and get something done like we did in our administrator maddow senators senators i want to give you 30 seconds sanders look maddow to follow up but i m going to hold you to 30 seconds sanders look the old ways are no longer relevant the scientists tell us we have 12 years because there s irreparable damage to this planet this is a global issue what the president of the united states should do is not deny the reality of climate change but tell the rest of the world that instead of spending 1 5 trillion on weapons of destruction let us get together for the common enemy and that is to transform the world energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy maddow thank you sanders the future of the planet rests on us doing that swalwell there there s todd before we go swalwell there s todd hang on maddow before we leave this topic swalwell here s a solution pass the torch pass the torch to the generation that s going to feel the effects unknown no sanders of climate change take on the fossil fuel swalwell pass the torch to the generation sanders is crosstalk the solution unknown that s inventive enough gillibrand agreed and maddow before we leave this topic here s something you all want to weigh in on hold on a moment todd just just gillibrand campaign to the republican party maddow hold on moment todd just trust us on this williamson and the fact todd we re going to marianne williamson invokes john f kennedy williamson that somebody has a younger body doesn t mean you don t have old ideas swalwell no we have new ideas williamson and john kennedy john kennedy swalwell we have real new ideas williamson did not say john kennedy did not say i m i have a plan to get a man to the moon and so we re going to do it and i think we can all work together and maybe we can get a man on the moon john kennedy said by the end of this decade we are going to put a man on the moon williamson because john kennedy was back in the day when politics included the people it included imagination and it included great dreams and included great plans maddow ms williamson todd thank you ms williamson williamson and i have a career not making the political plans but i have had a career harnessing the inspiration and the motivation and the excitement of people todd thank you ms williamson williamson masses of people when we know that when we say todd thank you williamson we are going to turn from a dirty economy todd thank you williamson to a clean economy we re going to have a green new deal we re going to create millions of jobs we re going to do this within the next 12 years because i m not interested in just winning the next election we are todd thank you ms williamson williamson inaudible our grandchildren todd all right we got to williamson then you will have it candidates on what their first issue would be if elected todd we re going to sneak in a break in a minute but before we go i m going to go down the line here and i m asking you please for one or two words all right please maddow really todd president obama in his first year wanted to address both healthcare and climate and he could only get one signature issue accomplished it was obviously healthcare he didn t get to do climate change you may only get one shot and your first issue that you re going to push you get one shot that it may be the only thing you get passed what is that first issue for your presidency eric swalwell you re first swalwell for parkland for orlando for every community effected by gun violence ending gun violence todd senator bennet bennet climate change and the lack of economic mobility bernie talks about todd senator gillibrand gillibrand passing a family bill of rights that includes a national paid leave plan universal pre k affordable daycare and making sure that women and families can thrive in the workplace no matter who they are todd all right harris oh i like that todd senator harris harris so passing a middle class and working families tax cut todd that s one harris daca guns todd i ll give you credit for the first thing you said the tax cut senator sanders first thing sanders the premise that there s only one or two issues out there todd i m not saying there s only one or two sanders is enormous crisis todd senator sanders sanders we need a political revolution people have got to stand up and take on the special interests we can transform this country todd vice president biden your first issue mr vice president biden i think you ve so underestimated what barack obama did he s the first man to bring together the entire world 196 nations to commit to deal with climate change immediately i don t i don t buy that the first the first thing i would do is make sure that we defeat donald trump todd okay biden period todd mayor buttigieg your first priority your first issue as president that you are going to block and tackle buttigieg we ve got to fix our democracy before it s too late get that right and climate immigration taxes and every other issue gets better todd mr mr yang yang i would pass a 1 000 freedom dividend for every american adult starting at age 18 which would speed us up on climate change because if you get the boot off of people s throats they re inaudible climate change much more clearly todd okay governor hickenlooper hickenlooper i would do a collaborative approach to climate change and i would pronounce it well before the election to make sure we don t reelect the worst president in american history todd and ms williamson you have the last word williamson my first call is to prime minister of new zealand who said that her role is to make new zealand the place where it s the best place in the world for a child to grow up and i would tell her girlfriend you are so wrong because the united states of america is going to be the best place todd thank you williamson in the world for a child to grow up we are going to have todd thank you you guys were close with the short at least it was shorter maddow no they weren t not at all todd all right c minus candidates on gun control maddow we re gonna take a quick break we ll be right back with these candidates right after this maddow welcome back to the democratic candidates debate in miami we are going to continue the questioning now with lester in the audience we aren t we are in a second going to have a question from lester in the audience that was just a fake out todd we re going to go the issue of guns and maddow congressman swalwell among this field of candidates you have a unique position on gun reform you re proposing that the government should buy back every assault weapon in america and it should be mandator how do you envision that working especially in states where gun rights are a flashpoint swalwell keep your pistols keep your rifles keep your shotguns but we can take the most dangerous weapons from the most dangerous people we have the nra on the ropes because of the moms because the brady group because of giffords because of march for our lives but i m the only candidate on this stage calling for a ban and buyback of every single assault weapon in america i ve seen the plans of the other candidates here they would all leave 15 million assault in our communities they wouldn t do a single thing to save a single life in parkland i will approach this issue as a prosecutor i will approach it as the only person on this stage who has voted and passed background checks but also as a parent of a generation who sends our children to school where we look at what they re wearing so we can remember it in case we have to identify them later a generation who has seen thousands of black children killed in our streets and a generation who goes to the theater and we actually where the fire exits are we don t have to live this way we must be a country who loves our children more than we love our guns maddow senator sanders a vermont newspaper recently released portions of an interview you gave in 2013 in which you said my own view on guns is everything being equal states should make those decisions sanders no maddow has your thinking changed since then do you now think there s a federal role to play sanders mischaracterization of my thinking look maddow it s a quote of you sanders we have a gun we have a gun crisis right now 40 000 people a year are getting killed in 1988 rachel when it wasn t popular i ran on a platform of banning assault weapons and in fact lost that race for congress i have a d minus voting record from the nra and i believe that what we need is comprehensive gun gun legislation that among other things provides universal background we end the gun show loophole we end the straw man provision and i believed in 1988 and i believe today that assault weapons swalwell why would you why would you leave 15 million on the streets sanders assault weapons assault weapons swalwell why would you leave senator sanders are weapons swalwell you leave 15 million on the streets sanders are from the military swalwell though sanders and that they should not be on the streets swalwell why do you leave sanders of america swalwell you would your plan leaves them on the streets you leave 15 million on the streets sanders we ban the sale and we ban the sale and distribution swalwell will you buy them back sanders and that s what i ve believed for many years swalwell will you will you buy them back harris and then and and sanders if people want to buy if the government wants to do that if people want bring it back swalwell but you re going to be the government sanders yes swalwell will you buy them back sanders yeah maddow senator harris we re going to give you 30 seconds here harris thank you i think your idea is a great one congressman swalwell and i will say there are a lot of great idea the problem is congress has not had the courage to act which is why when elected president of the united states i will give the united states congress 100 days to pull their act together bring all these good ideas together and put a bill on my desk for signature and if they do not i will take executive action and i will put in place the most comprehensive background check policy we ve had i will require the atf to take the licenses of gun dealers who violate the law and i will banned by executive order the importation of assault weapons because i m going to tell you as a prosecutor i have seen more autopsy photographs than i care to tell you i have hugged more mothers who are the mothers of homicide victims and i have attended more police officer funerals it is enough it is enough and there have been plenty of good ideas from members of the united states congress there s been no action as president i will take action maddow mayor buttigieg i want to bring you in on this sir a lot of discussion about assault rifles that are often as shorthanded as military style weapons you are the only person on the stage tonight with military experience as a veteran of the afghanistan war will military families does that inform your thinking on this view do you believe that military families or america s veterans will at large have a different take on this than the other americans who we ve been talking about and who congressman swalwell is appealing to with his buyback program buttigieg yeah of course because we trained on some of these kinds of weapons look every part of my life experience informs this being the mayor of a city where the worst part of the job is dealing with violence we we lose a as many as were lost at parkland every two or three years in my city alone and this is tearing communities apart if more guns made us safer we be the safest country on earth it doesn t work that way and commonsense measures like universal background checks can t seem to get delivered by washington even when most republicans let alone most americans agree it s the right thing to do and as somebody who trained on weapons of war i can tell you that there are weapons that have absolutely no place in american cities or neighborhoods in peacetime ever maddow vice president biden 30 seconds biden a real 30 seconds maddow a real 30 seconds biden okay i m the only person that s beaten the nra nationally i m the guy that got the brady bill passed the background checks number one number two we increased that background check when when during the obama biden administration i m also the only guy that got assault weapons banned banned and the number of clips in a gun banned and so folks look and i would buy back those weapons we already started talking about that we tried to get it done i think it can be done and it should be demanded that we do it and that s a good expenditure of money and lastly we should have smart guns no gun should be able to be sold unless your biometric measure could pull that trigger it s within our right to do that we can do that our enemy is the gun manufacturers not the nra the gun manufacturers maddow mr vice president thank you buttigieg but the nra is taking orders from todd all right buttigieg the gun manufacturers that s the problem todd lester holt has our next question lester take it away holt all right chuck this is a question from our viewers we put some suggestions that asked maybe they could share some of here s one that came from kathleen ph from canby oregon who writes many fear the current administration has inflicted irrevocable harm on our governing institutions and norms and in the process on our reputation abroad the question is what do you see as importance early steps in reversing the damage done and will put this one to senator bennet bennet thank you very much what an excellent question first of all we have to restore our democracy at home the rest of the world is looking for us for leadership we have a president who doesn t believe in the role of law he doesn t believe in freedom of the press he doesn t believe in an independent judiciary he believes in the corruption that he s brought to washington d c and that is what we have to change and that s why everybody is up here tonight and i appreciate the fact that there up here for that reason second we ve got to we ve got to restore the relationships that he s destroyed with our allies not just in europe he flew to the g20 last night and attacked japan germany and a third ally of ours without saying anything about north korea or russia and when you ve got a situation where you have a president who says something happens in the straits of hormuz and the whole world doesn t know whether to believe it or not that is a huge problem when it comes to the national security of the united states of america todd this is a perfect time bennet and we need to change that todd thank you senator bennet this is a perfect time for me to do another one of candidates on the first relationship they would reset as president todd thank you senator bennet this is the perfect time for me to do another one of inaudible the line and this is what this question is which is you are going to have to re you are likel

editor s note this story was originally published by occrp a kyiv post partner kypros chrysostomides is one of cyprus s most elite lawyers a wine connoisseur who boasts he was decorated by the french government and received the grand cross of the order of the phoenix from greece one of that country s highest honors but to disgraced american political operative paul manafort he was known as dr k the fix it man chrysostomides set up more than a dozen shell companies in cyprus for manafort and manafort s former associate rick gates through those companies the two american lobbyists received payments for political consultancy work in ukraine and wired more than 30 million some of which was used to make various purchases in the united states while avoiding u s taxes overall manafort s companies shifted more than 75 million through offshore accounts ank accounts for the shell companies that chrysostomides created funneled payments to the united states from offshore businesses of political allies of ex ukrainian president viktor yanukovych whom manafort and gates referred to as big guy or bg the transfer requests were sent directly to chrysostomides law firm in nicosia an address that was also the headquarters for all of the shell companies according to gates testimony at manafort s august 2018 trial in u s federal court on charges of fraud and financial crimes special counsel robert mueller homed in on manafort a former campaign manager for u s president donald trump in his probe of russian interference in the 2016 u s presidential election which shed light on manafort s business activities dr k however appears to have suffered no more than some bad publicity and occrp hasn t uncovered any evidence suggesting he ran afoul of the law he remains one of the most powerful and respected figures among a large group of cypriot lawyers who wittingly or unwittingly enable powerful people to commit crimes and then hide behind a law firm neither i nor any member or associate of our firm have ever advised any client to commit any breach of any rules of national or international law chrysostomides said in a statement responding to questions any such insinuation is nothing but a malicious statement without any support whatsoever manafort s and gates actions were aired in the u s media in the months leading up to manafort being sentenced to seven and a half years in prison manafort subsequently lost his license to practice law as well dr k s role is less well known american media have occasionally referred to him as a middleman lawyer and used his nickname chrysostomides is a veteran politician who served as spokesman for a government known to be friendly to kremlin hardliners and other russian business interests he was even briefly cyprus s justice and public order minister he also heads his own fringe political party the movement to restructure the center mrc for which manafort consulted about a decade ago lawyers serving in multiple roles including as leaders of political parties aren t rare in cyprus president nicos anastasiades was a partner in a law firm that served russian oligarchs while he headed his political party until he was elected president in 2013 chrysostomides also personifies the contradictions at play in cyprus a center of international finance and a european union member that has come again under the kremlin s sway even as it aims to improve ties to the united states and u s allies and his career is a prime example of how cyprus s corporate services industry frequently has aligned with various eastern european political factions serving the interests of oligarchs from russia or ukraine while remaining deeply linked to the highest levels of the republic of cyprus s government murky financial deals cyprus became a major destination for russian capital after the fall of the soviet union largely thanks to a double tax treaty signed in 1982 the island state which allows non eu citizens to open companies purchase real estate and acquire citizenship via a fast track golden visa program became even more attractive to wealthy russians when cyprus joined the eu in 2004 and adopted the euro in 2008 a senior fellow at the alliance for securing democracy asd a bipartisan group affiliated with the german marshall fund of the united states gmf and established in response to russian interference in the 2016 u s presidential elections said cyprus has undergone state capture by its offshore financial sector the system includes law firms with ties to politicians like chrysostomides and the one anastasiades established the firms that provide assistance to people with criminal intentions are often said to be part of the criminal services industry and some of the biggest corruption scandals in europe end in a cypriot law firm which invariably refuses to identify its clients offshore financial services have a very large role in the economy which gives them a lot of influence said asd s joshua kirschenbaum who formerly oversaw international money laundering probes as an official with the u s treasury department s financial crimes enforcement network that influence is enhanced by the strong political connections of the banks and the other service providers to current and former government officials law firms are one of the ways that that influence is channeled the too cozy relationships hurt cyprus reputation its international business relationships and its interactions with the u s government and other western governments kirschenbaum said a divided island kypros chrysostomides was born in 1942 to an ethnically greek family in the village of kathikas a wine producing community on the west coast of cyprus with fewer than 500 inhabitants as of 2011 at the time the strategically located mediterranean island was still a british colony populated for centuries by ethnic greeks and turks the nation gained independence in 1960 based on a power sharing agreement between the two communities the first post independence leader archbishop makarios was a greek with nationalist ambitions his efforts to drive the turkish cypriot community out of cyprus destabilized the island and led to a greek coup against him in 1974 and a turkish invasion in response this is the defining event of post independence cyprus a nation that finds itself 45 years later still ethnically divided a cease fire line runs directly through the capital nicosia separating the turks in the north and the greeks in the south cyprus became an open wound for the west to russia s benefit said makarios drousiotis a cypriot historian and author of several books about the country s post independence history chrysostomides studied law in athens luxembourg and bonn where he obtained a doctorate in the subject he also married well his wife eleni chrysostomides is the sister of prominent lawyer polys polyviou whose law office employs relatives of supreme court judges and represents the bank of cyprus the island s largest banking and financial services group that union gave chrysostomides entree into the lawyer elite one of the most influential forces in cyprus drousiotis said the island s politics are dominated by lawyers four of the nation s presidents since independence have been attorneys in 1981 chrysostomides established his own firm dr k chrysostomides co llc he also began building a reputation as one of cyprus s leading experts in international law writing a book on the topic and representing clients at the european court of human rights in cases involving displaced greek cypriots and others affected by turkey s 1974 invasion like many local cypriot lawyers he also took on clients with links to russia and ukraine the former law firm of current president anastasiades for example provided services to vladimir strzhalkovsky who media has identified as a former kgb officer and who served as deputy minister for economic development in russia he also co chaired the bank of cyprus for a short period before departing under hazy circumstances in 2015 the president s former firm also reportedly provided servicesfor energy and movie producing businessman leonid lebedev and a previous cypriot president tassos papadopoulos has been linked to the laundering of hundreds of millions in deutsche marks by former serbian leader slobodan milosevic u s commerce secretary wilbur ross formerly served as vice chairman of the bank of cyprus as for chrysostomides his clients include not only manafort but also former ukrainian president petro poroshenko and russian billionaire oleg deripaska whose business survived and prospered after he came out of the 1990s so called aluminum wars in control of rusal the world s second largest aluminum company recently deripaska has been under u s sanctions for more than a year in connection to russia s annexation of ukraine s crimea peninsula sanctions against his businesses were lifted in january the panama papers revealed that chrysostomides also provided corporate services to ruslan baisarov now the chairman of the board of ooo stroygazconsulting an energy infrastructure construction firm with the help of the panamanian law firm mossack fonseca and chrysostomides baisarov partnered with russian copper tycoon igor altushkin to acquire rodton international company assets inc a british virgin islands company at about the same time they acquired one of the world s largest coal reserves in the south central russian republic of tuva chrysostomides firm helped establish and later liquidate rodton legal eagle several factors make cyprus a popular destination for company registration it offers a low 12 5 percent corporate tax rate exempts non residents from dividend taxes and is party to an extensive list of treaties that help companies avoid double taxation the country is also a member of the eu and english is widely used for business these advantages have made the island an appealing place to set up convoluted financial structures and more than 218 000 companies are registered on the island today that s one for every four residents though the number is down from its all time peak of 272 157 in 2013 when the country experienced its worst ever banking crisis many of the companies used in criminal schemes are fronted by these omnipresent cypriot law firms demand for financial and company formation services has pushed the number of lawyers in cyprus to more than 3 900 for a population of less than 900 000 one of the highest densities in the eu the financial sector business combined with a relatively low crime rate has meant that some cypriot lawyers rely on tax advisory and company formation services more than on litigation and court cases for business according to floris alexander a dutch financial crime lawyer who previously provided fund recovery services in cyprus and advises danske bank investors starting in 1980 when the nation s offshore sector was still in its infancy chrysostomides began creating a constellation of companies known collectively as inter jura inter jura wasn t and isn t formally affiliated with chrysostomides law firm but almost all its companies share the firm s headquarters on lampousas street in nicosia inter jura cy services ltd inter jura cy nominees ltd and inter jura cy publishers ltd were established in 1980 these were followed three years later by inter jura cy holdings ltd inter jura cy management ltd and inter jura cy trust ltd most of the shares in inter jura holdings are held by chrysostomides wife eleni and a daughter georgia both of whom work at his firm in 2007 when chrysostomides was a member of parliament and simultaneously offering services to manafort and deripaska he established five more companies inter jura cy accounts ltd now named acs accountserve ltd inter jura cy directors ltd inter jura cy estates ltd inter jura cy global ltd and inter jura cy secretaries ltd the directors of the various inter jura companies frequently overlap with the names of lawyers at chrysostomides firm it s unclear what all of these companies do though rick gates has testified that inter jura acts as director for the companies it sets up hundreds of businesses list at least one individual associated with inter jura as a director or secretary suggesting inter jura provides nominee directors secretaries or shareholders that allow entrepreneurs to conduct almost all aspects of their business without their identities being public providing such corporate services is legal and setting up shell companies using nominee shareholders or directors is a common practice among those who seek to conceal the sources of their wealth or hide how they do business ukraine s former president poroshenko for example hired chrysostomides to set up a complex network of offshore companies that would allow him to keep controlling his candy business roshen though he had publicly promised to divest after being elected occrp revealed in 2016 oleg deripaska also relied on chrysostomides services to expand his aluminum mining and construction empire and his en group is still a client of inter jura cy services ltd this did not however deter the russian oligarch from going to court to compel it to disclose documents related to a lawsuit he filed against gates and manafort in which he accused the americans of embezzling funds that rightfully belonged to him manafort also appears to remain a client of chrysostomides there are more than five dozen other companies registered at 1 lampousas street or otherwise linked to the chrysostomides law firm or affiliated companies including agroton public ltd the eighth largest agricultural landholder in ukraine according to corporate records revealed in the panama papers and paradise papers leaks agroton s main shareholder is also a chrysostomides customer it is not surprising that oligarchs such as deripaska vekselberg and other wealthy people find cyprus attractive said alexander the dutch financial crime lawyer it was not a surprise to see manafort doing business in cyprus yet as part of cyprus s efforts to clean up its reputation last year its central bank told banks to avoid doing business with shell companies the move unsettled enough russian entrepreneurs that it prompted a public complaint from the russian ambassador cycling through cyprus manafort was led to cyprus by a cadre of wealthy ukrainian businessmen allied with former ukrainian president viktor yanukovych with yanukovych president and his party of the regions regaining power in ukraine manafort was at the pinnacle of his international political consulting career between 2007 and 2012 chrysostomides law firm and inter jura set up or administered at least 13 new shell companies with manafort or gates or both as their primary beneficiary all were headquartered at 1 lampousas st according to gates testimony in manafort s trial yanukovych s political allies directed manafort to buy pre registered shelf companies in cyprus a tactic they themselves were already using wiring funds from cyprus to cyprus would be the simplest way for the ukrainians to pay him an unnamed business associate put manafort in touch with chrysostomides to help out with political work according to gates wealthy leading members from yanukovych s party of regions and other allies among them rinat akhmetov serhiy lovochkin serhiy tihipko borys kolesnikov and andriy klyuyev all wired funds from accounts of companies they maintained in cyprus to companies set up by chrysostomides on manafort s behalf as the money flowed in manafort was wiring millions of dollars from cyprus to the united states to pay for antique rugs expensive men s clothing range rovers and other luxury items according to court documents he also purchased a 3 million brownstone and a 1 5 million condominium in new york city with money wired from the cyprus accounts manafort later directed gates to disguise income from his ukraine business as loans to reduce his taxable income this makes it difficult to determine whether manafort was actually in debt to ukrainian interests as some media outlets have reported or if the debt was just on paper manafort s companies had become a complex web of more than a dozen entities that transferred millions of dollars among them in loans payments and fees according to a july 2017 article in the new york times some political election work manafort didn t confine himself to just handling his finances in cyprus after all it was political work that led him to dr k we worked on some political election work for a candidate and that individual was also our attorney in cyprus for our business matters gates testified in proceedings against manafort a reference to chrysostomides in 2008 cyprus was having a presidential election mr manafort had been contacted by a business associate and asked us to meet with them and assess whether or not he had a prospect of not only running in the race but potentially winning gates said in 2008 chrysostomides didn t run for president but joined the cabinet of president demetris christofias then the leader of the communist party akel gates didn t name the business associate who had asked for the assessment however court records show that when manafort and chrysostomides did produce a memo on dr k s political prospects it was addressed to deripaska the putin crony and fellow client of chrysostomides at the time who has been under u s sanctions for more than a year deripaska s name surfaced repeatedly in the mueller probe due to his long association with manafort whom the oligarch had hired as an adviser to improve his reputation especially in the united states the 2009 memo on dr k drafted by manafort and chrysostomides briefly laid out how manafort s consulting firm davis manafort would work with chrysostomides to raise the fledgling politician s international profile especially within the eu and u s additionally as we have discussed we need to access your network to position kc properly both in europe and how it is portrayed in cyprus the memo said it proposed scheduling meetings between chrysostomides and various eu commissioners high profile members of the eu political elite and introducing him to similar persons of interest outside the eu as well as promoting the lawyer as a speaker at conferences and think tank events there was no information to suggest that deripaska responded to the memo or provided assistance in raising chrysostomides political profile at that time the global financial meltdown was also hitting deripaska s assets and his relationship with putin was temporarily souring although the memo proposed that candidates of chrysostomides s mrc party run in the may 2009 eu elections and cyprus s 2011 parliamentary elections this never occurred the memo also exaggerated the size of the party s membership as well as cyprus s electorate as a whole while manafort s plan to aid his cypriot lawyer in politics doesn t appear to have borne fruit the relationship of manafort and deripaska with dr k persisted around 2012 chrysostomides helped manafort move his offshore accounts out of cyprus according to gates it was just in time precisely that year the cyprus popular bank where manafort maintained accounts was nationalized even before the bank went out of business in march 2013 it shut down several of manafort s accounts citing his failure to comply with anti money laundering regulations at some point chrysostomides helped the consultant establish new accounts in st vincent and the grenadines an offshore tax haven in the caribbean gates testified he also assisted manafort in removing his name from his cypriot accounts as the u s lobbyist feared that a lawsuit he was engaged in with an unnamed ukrainian would expose information about him and the ukrainian businessmen from whom he had been receiving payments chrysostomides who responded to requests for comment for this story via a statement forwarded by his lawyer said that his law firm is bound by strict professional rules of confidentiality and etiquette and that he couldn t respond regarding his client s affairs any comment he added would require the client s consent or a court order of course i should state most categorically that neither i nor any member or associate of our firm have ever advised any client to commit any breach of any rules of national or international law he said any such insinuation is nothing but a malicious statement without any support whatsoever indicative is the fact that a number of the names mentioned as our firm s clients are names not known to us chrysostomides in the statement sent by his lawyer said that while he had long ago retired from politics it is the right of every citizen of cyprus to engage in political activities chrysostomides recently has been an adviser to president anastasiades on the issue of solving the island s longstanding divide the cypriot president s press office didn t respond to a request for comment nor did the law firm nicos chr anastasiades partners llc named after president anastasiades deripaska contacted via the media relations company that spoke on his behalf last year and manafort contacted via his lawyer also didn t respond end of an era in recent years amid increasing geopolitical tensions between russia and the west cyprus has come under pressure from the eu and the u s to step up anti money laundering efforts and ensure compliance with individual and corporate sanctions against oligarchs and their businesses in connection with for example human rights abuses and the annexation of crimea about a year ago cyprus launched a public relations campaign to inform stakeholders abroad about changes introduced after 2013 in its anti money laundering framework the measures stem partly from pressure by international creditors and the u s and are an attempt to improve cyprus reputation as a haven for money laundering the country also announced additional action against shell companies at the same time the island s government is courting u s french and other oil interests to help develop hydrocarbon reserves discovered in its exclusive economic zone the increasing alignment with the u s in the area of sanctions and anti money laundering has earned the island s government recognition from the u s and negatively affected its relationship with russia whose ambassador has complained about the impact on russian businesses russian bank deposits in cyprus fell sharply from 11 76 billion euros at the end of 2013 to 4 95 billion euros in january of this year according to a local news outlet which cited central bank data in the last two years alone russian deposits declined by 2 44 billion euros still cyprus s corporate services industry may not have to entirely give up its lucrative russian business according to a former banker and financial markets supervisor the balance cyprus has to maintain is delicate because of the interests of both the americans and the russians said marios clerides a former hellenic bank group and cyprus cooperative bank executive and former chairman of the cyprus securities and exchange commission the americans are not supporting us because they like our looks he said adding that the relationship has more to do with growing geopolitical tensions between the u s and turkey indeed both deripaska and manafort still maintain companies registered in cyprus and viktor vekselberg another u s sanctioned russian billionaire and putin associate remains the largest shareholder of the bank of cyprus
getty as the s p 500 index tests all time highs with an extraordinarily high valuation by most measures how can the ten year treasury bond yields be declining towards a generational low usually stocks go up when investors are increasingly bullish about the economy and treasury bond yields typically fall when investors are increasingly bearish about the economy but these two effects are happening simultaneously today the apparent contradiction is difficult to reconcile it may well be that we are witnessing a temporary anomaly which occasionally surfaces in the financial markets for example oil prices skyrocketed to 144 per barrel in 2008 at the same time that the housing bust and financial crisis were starting to accelerate how could oil prices have risen to record highs just as aggregate demand was falling off a cliff that anomaly corrected a few months later when oil prices declined by more than 75 to 34 per barrel similar to the oil price surge in 2008 the conflicting signals in the stock and bond markets today may simply be a short term anomaly if so then either the stock market is correct and the bond market is mistaken in which case we should see yields increase soon or the bond market is correct and the stock market is mistaken in which case investors should be experiencing a sharp correction in the stock market soon let s look at the stock market and the bond market individually to better understand why we have these seemingly conflicting signals with the bond market it s important to remember that when bond prices increase bond yields decline similarly when bond prices fall bond yields expand this relationship is somewhat counter intuitive but essential to understand from november 2018 until june 2019 u s treasury yields declined from 3 23 to 1 99 which is the lowest yield for ten year treasuries since 2016 a year in which treasury yields hit a new generational low of 1 36 why would the ten year treasury yield already relatively low decline so much during the past eight months increasing recession concerns investors like to buy u s treasuries when they think a recession is likely to arrive soon the treasury yield curve which is currently inverted is warning that a recession might be coming the new york fed uses this indicator to estimate that the chance of a recession within the next twelve months is as high as 30 see chart below the longer the yield curve remains inverted the more likely it is that a recession is soon coming besides the inverted yield curve other signals are also suggesting that the u s economy is at the very least slowing down if not approaching a recession david rosenberg a former economist of merrill lynch believes we are already in a recession because the index of aggregate hours worked and real business sales peaked in march while real personal income excluding government transfers and industrial production peaked in december with growth slowing and the increasing possibility of a recession ahead investors might be increasing their allocation to u s treasuries driving bond prices up and yields down pekin hardy strauss wealth management increasing pool of retiree investors as the u s population ages and 10 000 new baby boomers enter retirement daily demand for safety and yield among u s households should continue to increase retiree investors are going to be less inclined to own an oversized allocation to volatile stocks opting instead for u s treasuries in the chart below you can see how domestic investors have been purchasing an increasing percentage of u s treasury auctions it s possible that the strength in bonds recently is partly attributable to increasing demand by domestic investors who are aging and seeking a safe haven although it is difficult to understand why the domestic demand for treasuries would be discernably different today than it was eight months ago pekin hardy strauss wealth management federal reserve as a treasury buyer last year the federal reserve was reducing the size of its balance sheet by aggressively selling its u s treasury holdings this incremental supply increase pushed down treasury bond prices and pushed up treasury yields however with the stock market correction that took place in q4 and with economic numbers weakening the federal reserve is signaling that it will soon cease its sale of u s treasury bonds and soon begin to buy u s treasury bonds once again whether it s to fund the u s budget deficit or to push investors back into riskier assets the federal reserve is communicating to investors that large scale asset purchases of u s treasuries will soon begin again investors may be buying u s treasuries now to front run the federal reserve and enjoy the price appreciation that could take

a negative yield and that yield is generally becoming more negative as the global economy continues to weaken and as central banks communicate their willingness to do whatever it takes to provide additional monetary stimulus while u s treasury yields might appear to be low relative to what investors could earn twenty years ago treasury yields are high compared to most other countries in the developed world such as japan switzerland germany and sweden it may make sense for some bond investors to sell their negative yielding foreign bonds and increase their allocation to u s treasuries perhaps then the bond market is making sense with the economy slowing baby boomers aging and the federal reserve increasingly inclined to become a treasury buyer why not buy bonds however if that s the case why is the s p 500 index testing all time highs right now corporate buybacks with bond yields so low it remains inexpensive for companies to issue bonds and use those bond proceeds to buy back their own stock while corporate buybacks create weaker corporate balance sheets and increase long term stock market risk they nevertheless create incremental short term demand for shares and boost equity prices this trend has been driving the u s stock market for the past five years and this trend is driving the u s stock market today also with corporate bond yields so low private equity funds can more easily finance the acquisition of publicly traded companies with cheap debt while baby boomers might be reallocating their investments towards bonds other investors namely corporations

using leverage to buy stocks stocks as bond substitutes with the 10 year treasury yield at 2 0 doesn t it seem like a good idea to buy a utility company like exelon which provides investors with a dividend yield of 3 1 many investors have been pursuing higher yielding bond substitutes and seeking out dividend paying stocks as a result the utility sector has been the best performing sector of the market during the past twelve months even though utility stocks are egregiously overvalued trading at twice the twenty year average for the sector s multiple of sales moreover the reach for yield

sight at the same time an emerging consensus is developing that the dollar is too strong relative to other currencies making it difficult for u s manufacturers to compete president trump and elizabeth warren have both remarked recently that a depreciated dollar is a critical factor to america s future economic competitiveness and economists like carmen reinhart advocate that the federal reserve keep bonds yields well below the inflation rate to reflate the economy while seemingly overvalued stocks may be an attractive hedge for those investors looking for inflation protection with this backdrop it seems more likely than not that stocks could struggle for the rest of the year and that the federal reserve will if anything be more aggressive in providing monetary stimulus than most people expect unlike 2008 when the federal reserve appeared to be asleep at the switch central banks around the world are alert today for better or for worse and stand ready to provide markets with liquidity to avoid another debt crisis if and when the federal reserve floods the economy with additional liquidity the dollar would likely depreciate and the u s stock market would likely react favorably with that said the u s stock market is still overvalued and even at 2 the yield on ten year treasuries is hardly compensating investors for future inflation expectations it may be worth considering alternative asset classes with better risk reward profiles compared to u s stocks foreign stocks look more attractive from a valuation standpoint and emerging market stocks look far more attractive stocks outside the united states have more reasonable valuation ratios and there are good reasons to expect that stocks outside the united states could outperform if the u s dollar does depreciate versus foreign currencies in the coming years also compared to ten year treasury bonds short term treasury bonds look more attractive treasury bonds that mature in a year also pay 2 so investors would be generating the same level of yield while taking far less duration risk gold too looks attractive relative to treasury bonds as the real inflation adjusted yield on long term

chrysostomides also personifies the contradictions at play in cyprus a center of international finance and a european union member that has come again under the kremlin s sway even as it aims to improve ties to the united states and u s allies and his career is a prime example of how cyprus s corporate services industry frequently has aligned with various eastern european political factions serving the interests of oligarchs from russia or ukraine while remaining deeply linked to the highest levels of the republic of cyprus s government lawyers serving in multiple roles including as leaders of political parties aren t rare in cyprus president nicos anastasiades was a partner in a law firm that served russian oligarchs while he headed his political party until he was elected

testimony cyprus became a major destination for russian capital after the fall of the soviet union largely thanks to a double tax treaty signed in 1982 the island state which allows non eu citizens to open companies purchase real estate and acquire citizenship via a fast track golden visa program became even more attractive to wealthy russians when cyprus joined the eu in 2004 and adopted the euro in 2008 a senior fellow at the alliance for securing democracy asd a bipartisan group affiliated with the german marshall fund of the united states gmf and established in response to russian interference in the 2016 u s presidential elections said cyprus has undergone state capture by its offshore financial sector the system includes law firms with ties to politicians like chrysostomides and the one anastasiades established the firms that provide assistance to people with criminal intentions are often said to be part of the criminal services industry and some of the biggest corruption scandals in europe end in a cypriot law firm which invariably refuses to identify its clients offshore financial services have a very large role in the economy which gives them a lot of influence said asd s joshua kirschenbaum who formerly oversaw international money laundering probes as an official with the u s treasury department s financial crimes enforcement network that influence is enhanced by the strong political connections of the banks and the other service providers to current and former government officials law firms are one of the ways that that influence is channeled the too cozy relationships hurt cyprus reputation its international business relationships and its interactions with the u s government and other western governments kirschenbaum said a divided island kypros chrysostomides was born in 1942 to an ethnically greek family in the village of kathikas a wine producing community on the west coast of cyprus with fewer than 500 inhabitants as of 2011 at the time the strategically located mediterranean island was still a british colony populated for centuries by ethnic greeks and turks the nation gained independence in 1960 based on a power sharing agreement between the two communities the first post independence leader archbishop makarios was a greek with nationalist ambitions his efforts to drive the turkish cypriot community out of cyprus destabilized the island and led to a greek coup against him in 1974 and a turkish invasion in response this is the defining event of post independence cyprus a nation that finds itself 45 years later still ethnically divided a cease fire line runs directly through the capital nicosia separating the turks in the north and the greeks in the south cyprus became an open wound for the west to russia s

court judges and represents the bank of cyprus the island s largest banking and financial services group that union gave chrysostomides entree into the lawyer elite one of the most influential forces

development in russia he also co chaired the bank of cyprus for a short period before departing under hazy circumstances in 2015 the president s former firm also reportedly provided services for energy and movie producing businessman leonid lebedev and a previous cypriot president tassos papadopoulos has been linked to the laundering of hundreds of millions in deutsche marks by former serbian leader slobodan milosevic u s commerce secretary wilbur ross formerly served as vice chairman of the bank of cyprus as for chrysostomides his clients include not only manafort but also former ukrainian president petro poroshenko and russian billionaire oleg deripaska whose business survived and prospered after he came out of the 1990s so called aluminum wars in control of rusal the world s second largest aluminum company recently deripaska has been under u s sanctions for more than a year in connection to russia s annexation of ukraine s crimea peninsula sanctions against his businesses were lifted in january the panama papers documents obtained by süddeutsche zeitung and shared with the international consortium of investigative journalists icij revealed that chrysostomides also provided corporate services to ruslan baisarov now the chairman of the board of ooo stroygazconsulting an energy infrastructure construction firm with the help of the panamanian law firm mossack fonseca and chrysostomides baisarov partnered with russian copper tycoon igor altushkin to acquire rodton international company assets inc a british virgin islands company at about the same time they acquired one of the world s largest coal reserves in the south central russian republic of tuva chrysostomides firm helped establish and later liquidate rodton legal eagle several factors make cyprus a popular destination for company registration it offers a low 12 5 percent corporate tax rate exempts non residents from dividend taxes and is party to an extensive list of treaties that help companies avoid double taxation the country is also a member of the eu and english is widely used for business these advantages have made the island an appealing place to set up convoluted financial structures and more than 218 000 companies are registered on the island today that s one for every four residents though the number is down from its all time peak of 272 157 in 2013 when the country experienced its worst ever banking crisis many of the companies used in criminal schemes are fronted by these omnipresent cypriot law firms demand for financial and company formation services has pushed the number of lawyers in cyprus to more than 3 900 for a population of less than 900 000 one of the highest densities in the eu the financial sector business combined with a relatively low crime rate has meant that some cypriot lawyers rely on tax advisory and company formation services more than on litigation and court cases for business according to floris alexander a dutch financial crime lawyer who previously provided fund recovery services in cyprus and advises danske bank investors starting in 1980 when the nation s offshore sector was still in its infancy chrysostomides began creating a constellation of companies known collectively as inter jura inter jura wasn t and isn t formally affiliated with chrysostomides law firm but almost all its companies share the firm s headquarters on lampousas street in nicosia inter jura cy services ltd inter jura cy nominees ltd and inter jura cy publishers ltd were established in 1980 these were followed three years later by inter jura cy holdings ltd inter jura cy management ltd and inter jura cy trust ltd most of the shares in inter jura holdings are held by chrysostomides wife eleni and a daughter georgia both of whom work at his firm in 2007 when chrysostomides was a member of parliament and simultaneously offering services to manafort and deripaska he established five more companies inter jura cy accounts ltd now named acs accountserve ltd inter jura cy directors ltd inter jura cy estates ltd inter jura cy global ltd and inter jura cy secretaries ltd the directors of the various inter jura companies frequently overlap with the names of lawyers at chrysostomides firm credit flora alexandrou before cyprus popular bank trading as laiki bank went out of business in 2013 it shut down several of manafort s accounts citing a failure to comply with anti money laundering regulations it s unclear what all of these companies do though rick gates has testified that inter jura acts as director for the companies it sets up hundreds of businesses list at least one individual associated with inter jura as a director or secretary suggesting inter jura provides nominee directors secretaries or shareholders that allow entrepreneurs to conduct almost all aspects of their business without their identities being public providing such corporate services is legal and setting up shell companies using nominee shareholders or directors is a common practice among those who seek to conceal the sources of their wealth or hide how they do business ukraine s former president poroshenko for example hired chrysostomides to set up a complex network of offshore companies that would allow him to keep controlling his candy business roshen though he had publicly promised to divest after being elected occrp revealed in 2016 oleg deripaska also relied on chrysostomides services to expand his aluminum mining and construction empire and his en group is still a client of inter jura cy services ltd this did not however deter the russian oligarch from going to court to compel it to disclose documents related to a lawsuit he filed against gates and manafort in which he accused the americans of embezzling funds that rightfully belonged to him manafort also appears to remain a client of chrysostomides there are more than five dozen other companies registered at 1 lampousas street or otherwise linked to the chrysostomides law firm or affiliated companies including agroton public ltd the eighth largest agricultural landholder in ukraine according to corporate records revealed in the panama papers and paradise papers leaks agroton s main shareholder is also a chrysostomides customer it is not surprising that oligarchs such as deripaska vekselberg and other wealthy people find cyprus attractive said alexander the dutch financial crime lawyer it was not a surprise to see manafort doing business in cyprus yet as part of cyprus s efforts to clean up its reputation last year its central bank told banks to avoid doing business with shell companies the move unsettled enough russian entrepreneurs that it prompted a public complaint from the russian ambassador cycling through cyprus manafort was led to cyprus by a cadre of wealthy ukrainian businessmen allied with former ukrainian president viktor yanukovych with yanukovych president and his party of the regions regaining power in ukraine manafort was at the pinnacle of his international political consulting career between 2007 and 2012 chrysostomides law firm and inter jura set up or administered at least 13 new shell companies with manafort or gates or both as their primary beneficiary all were headquartered at 1 lampousas st according to gates testimony in manafort s trial yanukovych s political allies directed manafort to buy pre registered shelf companies in cyprus a tactic they themselves were already using wiring funds from cyprus to cyprus would be the simplest way for the ukrainians to pay him an unnamed business associate put manafort in touch with chrysostomides to help out with political work credit mark reinstein alamy stock photo rick gates and donald trump at the 2016 republican national convention according to gates wealthy leading members from yanukovych s party of regions and other allies among them rinat akhmetov serhiy lovochkin serhiy tihipko borys kolesnikov and andriy klyuyev all wired funds from accounts of companies they maintained in cyprus to companies set up by chrysostomides on manafort s behalf as the money flowed in manafort was wiring millions of dollars from cyprus to the united states to pay for antique rugs expensive men s clothing range rovers and other luxury items according to court documents he also purchased a 3 million brownstone and a 1 5 million condominium in new york city with money wired from the cyprus accounts manafort later directed gates to disguise income from his ukraine business as loans to reduce his taxable income this makes it difficult to determine whether manafort was actually in debt to ukrainian interests as some media outlets have reported or if the debt was just on paper manafort s companies had become a complex web of more than a dozen entities that transferred millions of dollars among them in loans payments and fees according to a july 2017 article in the new york times some political election work manafort didn t confine himself to just handling his finances in cyprus after all it was political work that led him to dr k we worked on some political election work for a candidate and that individual was also our attorney in cyprus for our business matters gates testified in proceedings against manafort a reference to chrysostomides in 2008 cyprus was having a presidential election mr manafort had been contacted by a business associate and asked us to meet with them and assess whether or not he had a prospect of not only running in the race but potentially winning gates said in 2008 chrysostomides didn t run for president but joined the cabinet of president demetris christofias then the leader of the communist party akel gates didn t name the business associate who had asked for the assessment however court records show that when manafort and chrysostomides did produce a memo on dr k s political prospects it was addressed to deripaska the putin crony and fellow client of chrysostomides at the time who has been under u s sanctions for more than a year credit kremlin ru oleg deripaska confers with russian president vladimir putin at a meeting in 2006 deripaska s name surfaced repeatedly in the mueller probe due to his long association with manafort whom the oligarch had hired as an adviser to improve his reputation especially in the united states the 2009 memo on dr k drafted by manafort and chrysostomides briefly laid out how manafort s consulting firm davis manafort would work with chrysostomides to raise the fledgling politician s international profile especially within the eu and u s additionally as we have discussed we need to access your network to position kc properly both in europe and how it is portrayed in cyprus the memo said it proposed scheduling meetings between chrysostomides and various eu commissioners high profile members of the eu political elite and introducing him to similar persons of interest outside the eu as well as promoting the lawyer as a speaker at conferences and think tank events there was no information to suggest that deripaska responded to the memo or provided assistance in raising chrysostomides political profile at that time the global financial meltdown was also hitting deripaska s assets and his relationship with putin was temporarily souring although the memo proposed that candidates of chrysostomides s mrc party run in the may 2009 eu elections and cyprus s 2011 parliamentary elections this never occurred the memo also exaggerated the size of the party s membership as well as cyprus s electorate as a whole while manafort s plan to aid his cypriot lawyer in politics doesn t appear to have borne fruit the relationship of manafort and deripaska with dr k persisted around 2012 chrysostomides helped manafort move his offshore accounts out of cyprus according to gates it was just in time precisely that year the cyprus popular bank where manafort maintained accounts was nationalized even before the bank went out of business in march 2013 it shut down several of manafort s accounts citing his failure to comply with anti money laundering regulations at some point chrysostomides helped the consultant establish new accounts in st vincent and the grenadines an offshore tax haven in the caribbean gates testified he also assisted manafort in removing his name from his cypriot accounts as the u s lobbyist feared that a lawsuit he was engaged in with an unnamed ukrainian would expose information about him and the ukrainian businessmen from whom he had been receiving payments chrysostomides who responded to requests for comment for this story via a statement forwarded by his lawyer said that his law firm is bound by strict professional rules of confidentiality and etiquette and that he couldn t respond regarding his client s affairs any comment he added would require the client s consent or a court order of course i should state most categorically that neither i nor any member or associate of our firm have ever advised any client to commit any breach of any rules of national or international law he said any such insinuation is nothing but a malicious statement without any support whatsoever indicative is the fact that a number of the names mentioned as our firm s clients are names not known to us chrysostomides in the statement sent by his lawyer said that while he had long ago retired from politics it is the right of every citizen of cyprus to engage in political activities chrysostomides recently has been an adviser to president anastasiades on the issue of solving the island s longstanding divide the cypriot president s press office didn t respond to a request for comment nor did the law firm nicos chr anastasiades partners llc named after president anastasiades deripaska contacted via the media relations company that spoke on his behalf last year and manafort contacted via his lawyer also didn t respond end of an era in recent years amid increasing geopolitical tensions between russia and the west cyprus has come under pressure from the eu and the u s to step up anti money laundering efforts and ensure compliance with individual and corporate sanctions against oligarchs and their businesses in connection with for example human rights abuses and the annexation of crimea about a year ago cyprus launched a public relations campaign to inform stakeholders abroad about changes introduced after 2013 in its anti money laundering framework the measures stem partly from pressure by international creditors and the u s and are an attempt to improve cyprus reputation as a haven for money laundering the country also announced additional action against shell companies at the same time the island s government is courting u s french and other oil interests to help develop hydrocarbon reserves discovered in its exclusive economic zone the increasing alignment with the u s in the area of sanctions and anti money laundering has earned the island s government recognition from the u s and negatively affected its relationship with russia whose ambassador has complained about the impact on russian businesses russian bank deposits in cyprus fell sharply from 11 76 billion euros at the end of 2013 to 4 95 billion euros in january of this year according to a local news outlet which cited central bank data in the last two years alone russian deposits declined by 2 44 billion euros still cyprus s corporate services industry may not have to entirely give up its lucrative russian business according to a former banker and financial markets supervisor the balance cyprus has to maintain is delicate because of the interests of both the americans and the russians said marios clerides a former hellenic bank group and cyprus cooperative bank executive and former chairman of the cyprus securities and exchange commission the americans are not supporting us because they like our looks he said adding that the relationship has more to do with growing geopolitical tensions between the u s and turkey indeed both deripaska and manafort still maintain companies registered in cyprus and viktor vekselberg another u s sanctioned russian billionaire and putin associate remains the largest shareholder of the bank of cyprus

president donald trump has long been convinced that the united states is locked in an unfair trading relationship with china the u s has lost 500 billion a year for many years he has said several times in a possible reference to the balance of trade that showed the nation bought 420 billion more goods from china in 2018 than it sold trump has long touted china s huge exports to the u s as a sign that beijing has been taking advantage of american businesses for decades his determination to redress what he sees as an imbalance has resulted in an escalating trade war with stringent tariffs affecting not only the two countries economic outlooks but also the entire global economy and when he sits down with xi jinping on the sidelines of the g 20 summit being held june 28 and 29 in osaka japan all eyes will be on whether they can restart trade talks that collapsed amid a war of words in may while both sides have good economic incentives to return to free trade experts say the two superpowers also have good political reasons to hold firm and back up the tough rhetoric with action on the u s side the mood music was good with treasury secretary steven mnuchin saying wednesday that washington and beijing were almost done with their trade deal whatever happens next the u s china spat threatens to overshadow the meeting of some of the world s leading economies and crucial topics such as climate change and urgent reform of the world trade organization in may trump doubled u s tariffs on 200 billion of chinese goods to 25 percent and said he was prepared to slap the same tariff on the remaining 300 billion if there was no progress in talks the effect of this would be huge goldman sachs has warned it would cause global equity markets to fall by 4 percent the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd predicts that renewed tensions between the two countries could see global gross domestic product gdp drop by as much as 0 6 percent the chief economist of the international monetary fund imf gita gopinath said in a blog post in may that the trade war could significantly dent business and financial market sentiment disrupt global supply chains and jeopardize the projected recovery in global growth in 2019 low income households in the u s would be chief among those to suffer from increased prices if the tariff regime was extended she added that s why the mood music coming out of osaka the first official meeting between the two sides in months matters so much why has the dispute become so intense trump spoke so much about u s china trade on the campaign trail in 2015 that a three minute compilation video of him saying china went viral on social media and has since been viewed more than 15 million times a sign for the g 20 summit at a train station in osaka japan tomohiro ohsumi getty images and as promised he has delivered an anti globalization protectionist america first trade agenda billed as a policy that protects u s workers and businesses from unfair chinese practices not everyone believes trump s bold rhetoric will be met by further action there is a real question over whether the u s administration would really be willing to impose all of those i m dubious because this would involve putting tariffs on almost all of the rest of chinese imports said mike jakeman a senior economist at pwc the accountancy and consultancy company in london that would lead to domestic inflation and suddenly you ve got consumers who are quite angry as to why the cost of buying a new iphone has gone up appreciably he said and in an election year when trump has already talked about the economy extensively in his campaign he probably won t want that risk trump s twitter account hails u s economic success on a daily basis from record jobs numbers to stock market highs and it s this economic good fortune that allows him to treat china in terms of foreign policy not just economics jakeman added it s remarkable that trump has gone almost three quarters of the way through his term without really having a difficult decision to make about the economy he has enjoyed a really solid spell that s allowed him to pursue his foreign policy strategy he said national pride as for china the dispute is also about national pride as well as economic success posturing goes both ways and according to james mcgregor an american author journalist and businessman who has lived in china for more than 25 years and is currently chairman of the consulting firm apco worldwide china may have more time to spare despite its domestic economic slowdown the bremen express cargo ship prepares to dock at florida s portmiami which saw china as its top trading country in 2018 joe raedle getty images file i think we have to remember xi jinping does not have to get re elected in 2020 donald trump does and when there s more tariffs coming and they really hit the u s economy and the stock market takes a dive trump will want the stock market to go back up before his election he said so i do think china can be more patient than the u s on this because it s now wrapped up in chinese nationalism very tightly because of huawei he said referring to the huge chinese communications firm that in may was banned from doing business in the u s on whether china is being unfair to u s companies seeking to do business in the country as trump and others allege the picture is more complex the trump administration has made chinese compliance with ip laws a priority for any agreement on reducing or eliminating tariffs between the two countries and it has become a protectionist issue that underscores national pride for both leaders all the more so after trump banned huawei china s leading communications firm from doing business in the u s vicky pryce a former senior u k government economist and now a board member at the centre for economics and business research a london based consultancy said that while american consumers would ultimately be the ones to pay the price for higher tariffs the u s had been justified in taking china to task on various fronts president donald trump greets china s president xi jinping during a business leaders event at the great hall of the people in beijing on nov 8 2017 nicolas asfouri afp getty images file for one thing the government helps chinese companies in a variety of ways such as widespread hidden subsidies she said china has been opening up and so on but it has used all sorts of tricks that make it hard for anyone to see if they have been dumping goods and so on she said you can t say whether in an economic sense it s been wrong but the question is whether you go about it this way the issue of ip theft has long been a bone of contention for trump and for american businesses one third of whom say chinese firms have stolen from them at some point in the past decade at a cost of between 225 billion and 600 billion annually according to the office of the u s trade representative china needs to step up efforts in reform and opening up and carry out more policies in respecting and treating foreign companies and chinese companies as equal to create a better business environment said wei jianguo a former vice minister of commerce and the vice president of china international economic exchange center a government think tank the escalation of tariffs comes as the global economy faces the possibility of a downturn after picking up in 2016 and 2017 with investment and manufacturing stagnating economists generally define a global recession as when growth falls below 2 percent the imf is forecasting 3 6 percent for 2020 which is out of the danger zone but significantly below the 4 percent seen in 2017 so an economic cease fire between the two sides could be a much needed boost if there is suddenly a resolution of the trade problem then you could see a very substantial improvement pryce said i don t think it s a very happy environment at the moment

and a decrease of 16 1 sequentially our gross margin was 16 6 up from 14 7 sequentially and 14 4 year over year as we increasingly benefit from a higher proportion of sales being generated by our self produced high efficiency mono products and further reductions in production cost we continue to see strong demand from overseas markets and have secured the vast majority of our order book for the rest of the year the global solar market continues to generate rapid and sustainable growth momentum as grid parity approaches in particular for our high efficiency mono products which are continuously in short supply our global distribution network allowed us to quickly meet growing demand for our high efficiency mono products over the past few quarters as the market transitioned we are accelerating the expansion of our high efficiency mono production capacity and estimate they will account for over 60 of our total shipments for the year on the domestic front policies recently laid out by china s national energy administration are expected to create a strong demand during the second half of the year china is expected to install 40 gw this year european markets continue to perform very well following the cancellation of the minimum import price policy resulting in a surge in demand from price sensitive projects we expect european installations to hit 17 gw this year in the u s recent policy changes exempting bifacial solar modules from section 201 tariffs are expected to further accelerate medium and long term demand and significantly increase the application of bifacial modules the u s is expected to install 12 gw to 15 gw this year we successfully raised us 160 million last month in a follow on offering of adss and concurrent private placement of convertible senior notes which is being deployed to expand our mono wafer and perc cell capacities our new 5 gw mono wafer production facility in leshan sichuan province began trial production this

launched the latest addition to our premium cheetah products the swan bifacial module with a new dupont clear dupont tedlar based backsheet this module uses lightweight materials which alleviate a number of problems during the installation process and lower cost per kilowatt hour of electricity produced for our customers we believe that demand for bifacial transparent backsheet products will grow rapidly as they become more mainstream going forward i am pleased with the progress we made during the quarter in reinforcing our competitive strengths and favorably positioning ourselves for the

key overseas markets module shipments during the first quarter were 3 037 megawatts an increase of 50 7 year over year and a decrease of 16 1 sequentially our gross margin was 16 6 up from 14 7 sequentially and 14 4 year over year as we increasingly benefit from a higher proportion of sales being generated by our self produced high efficiency mono products and further reductions in production cost we continue to see strong demand from overseas markets and have secured the vast majority of our order book for the rest of the year the global solar market continues to generate rapid and sustainable growth momentum as grid parity approaches in particular for our high efficiency mono products which are continuously in short supply our global distribution network allowed us to quickly meet growing demand for our high efficiency mono products over the past few quarters as the market transitioned we are accelerating the expansion of our high efficiency mono production capacity and estimate they will account for over 60 of our total shipments for the year on the domestic front policies recently laid out by china s national energy administration are expected to create a strong demand during the second half of the year china is expected to install 40 gw this year european markets continue to perform very well following the cancellation of the minimum import price policy resulting in a surge in demand from price sensitive projects we expect european installations to hit 17 gw this year in the u s recent policy changes exempting bifacial solar modules from section 201 tariffs are expected to further accelerate medium and long term demand and significantly increase the application of bifacial modules the u s is expected to install 12 gw to 15 gw this year we successfully raised us 160 million last month in a follow on offering of adss and concurrent private placement of convertible senior notes which is being deployed to expand our mono wafer and perc cell capacities our new 5 gw mono wafer production facility in leshan sichuan province began trial production this month and will ramp up to full capacity by the fourth quarter of this year this new production facility will serve as a benchmark for the industry with its cutting edge technology and industry leading cost structure the additional mono wafer capacity will allow us to significantly increase the proportion of self produced high efficiency products and improve overall profitability this year we also launched the latest addition to our premium cheetah products the swan bifacial module with a new dupont clear dupont tedlar based backsheet this module uses lightweight materials which alleviate a number of problems during the installation process and lower cost per kilowatt hour of electricity produced for our customers we believe that demand for bifacial transparent backsheet products will grow rapidly as they become more mainstream going forward i am pleased with the progress we made during the quarter in reinforcing our competitive strengths and favorably positioning ourselves for the future we will continue to expand our market share in china and overseas ramp up production of high efficiency mono products and leverage our strong brand recognition and reputation for quality to meet global demand first quarter 2019 financial results total

available information suggests that the world economy decelerated during the second quarter of the year this situation was due to moderation of growth in some of the main advanced and emerging economies although job creation has slightly decreased unemployment rates in the main advanced economies remain at low levels and wages continue recovering gradually in turn headline and core inflation in these economies have remained at low levels and their expectations have decreased the aforementioned environment has increased the possibility that central banks of the major economies will adopt more accommodative monetary policy stances in its june meeting the us federal reserve left unchanged the target range for the federal funds rate in its policy statement it mentioned that the uncertainty faced by the us economy has increased under conditions where there is absence of inflationary pressures and that hence it will follow closely the economic developments it added that it would take the appropriate measures in order to sustain the economic expansion with a strong labor market and inflation at levels close to its symmetric 2 objective this led to a decline in interest rates throughout the entire yield curve and to an increase in risk appetite levels in international financial markets nevertheless risks to the global economy persist a further escalation of trade tensions between the united states and its main trade partners the weakness of some of the major economies extending longer than foreseen new episodes of volatility arising in international financial markets and the intensification of certain political and geopolitical risks for this reason the balance of risks for the global economy remains biased to the downside since the last monetary policy decision domestic financial markets underwent episodes of volatility due to the threat of tariffs on mexican imports by the u s and to the revisions to the outlook or the credit rating of sovereign debt and of pemex s debt by some rating agencies given the agreement reached between the governments of mexico and the united states and the greater risk appetite among investors in view of the outlook for more accommodative monetary policies the peso exchange rate reverted its previously observed depreciation and government securities long and medium term nominal and real interest rates decreased significantly risks that may deteriorate the performance of financial assets in mexico are still present in particular although domestic financial markets have been adjusting to this environment uncertainty regarding the bilateral relationship between mexico and the united states and the credit outlook both for pemex s debt and for mexico s sovereign debt persists the current environment continues to pose significant medium and long term risks that could affect the country s macroeconomic conditions its potential growth and the economy s price formation process in this regard it is particularly important that in addition to a prudent and firm monetary policy measures 2 to foster an environment of confidence and certainty for investment and higher productivity are adopted and public finances are consolidated in a sustainable way in this context addressing the deterioration of both the sovereign s and pemex s credit ratings and achieving the fiscal targets set in the economic package for 2019 are necessary available information suggests that in april economic activity increased marginally on a month to month basis below market expectations standing out a slowdown of the services sectors after the contraction exhibited in the previous quarter and that most components of aggregate demand especially those related to domestic demand remain weak slack conditions in the economy have loosened even further than expected the balance of risks for growth has become more uncertain and its downside bias has increased between april and the first fortnight of june headline inflation fell from 4 41 to 4 00 due to the significant decline of the non core component which went from 6 08 to 4 34 reflecting the lower increases observed in the prices of fruits and vegetables as well as in energy products the latter partly due to the fall in their international references the lower increases of both of these components more than offset the increases registered in livestock product prices as for core inflation it was 3 87 both in april and in the first fortnight of june such result is due to the fact that although the rate of change of food merchandise prices continued to increase that of services decreased during the period between may and mid june short medium and long term headline and core inflation expectations did not register significant adjustments albeit in all cases they remained above the 3 target regarding information drawn from market instruments medium and long term breakeven inflation expectations remain at high levels as for inflation risks some have diminished and others have gained relevance to the upside the possibility that the peso exchange rate comes under pressure stemming from external or domestic factors stands out should the economy require adjustments either to the real exchange rate or to medium and long term interest rates banco de méxico will contribute to orderly adjustments in an effort to prevent second round effects on the economy s price formation process the threat by the united states to impose tariffs on mexican imports and the adoption of compensatory measures also deserves mention although this risk has decreased as a result of the recent agreement other risks are that energy prices revert their downward trend or that agricultural and livestock product prices exhibit increases that public finances deteriorate that core inflation s persistence influences medium and long term inflation expectations by making them show a greater resistance to decline and that global protectionist measures escalate in addition given the magnitude of several wage revisions that cost related pressures arise insofar as such revisions exceed productivity gains to the downside that the peso exchange rate appreciates possibly associated with a context of more accommodative monetary policy stances and lower interest rates worldwide or in case greater certainty regarding the trade relation with the united states is achieved another downside risk is that the prices of certain goods included in the non core subindex register lower rates of change as observed in the case of energy goods due to the greater weakness exhibited by the world economy in addition that slack conditions widen more than anticipated as suggested by the latest information on economic activity which might influence the behavior of core inflation given the aforementioned high uncertainty persists regarding the risks that might affect inflation to guide its monetary policy actions banco de méxico s governing board follows closely the development of inflation vis à vis its forecasted trajectory taking into account the monetary policy stance and the time frame in which monetary policy operates in this process it uses available information on all inflation determinants as well as on medium and long term inflation expectations including the balance of risks for such factors monetary policy must also respond prudently if for any reason the 3 uncertainty faced by the economy increases considerably in this context considering that the current monetary policy is consistent with the convergence of inflation to its target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates banco de méxico s governing board has decided by majority to maintain the target for the overnight interbank interest rate at 8 25

results in 2019 our successful execution of our strategies and engagement of employees around the world have driven sales operating profit and adjusted eps growth as well as operating margin expansion in both the second quarter and year to date starting on slide 4 our broad and advantaged global flavor portfolio continues to position us to meet the demand for flavor around the world to grow our business among our second quarter highlights across our portfolio we drove growth in our consumer segment base business and through new products in all regions including zatarain s meal solutions and frozen entrées and u k rapid recipe mixes in the americas frank s redhot sauce continues its strong performance and we are also gaining momentum with frank s internationally in our flavor solutions

quarter performance as seen on slide 5 as well as provide some business comments before turning it over to mike who will go more in depth on the quarter end results and discuss our 2019 financial guidance starting with our top line for the second quarter second quarter sales were comparable to the year ago period including a 3 unfavorable impact from currency in constant currency sales grew 3 for the total company with both segments growing sales in each of our three regions this growth was attributable to higher volume and product mix as well as pricing and was entirely organic driven by the base business and new products as we had no acquisition impact in the quarter in our consumer segment sales declined 1 including a 3 unfavorable impact from currency in constant currency sales grew 2 in our flavor solutions segment sales grew 1 and in constant currency grew 4 in addition to our top line growth we grew adjusted operating income and expanded our adjusted operating margin with our higher sales and cost savings led by our comprehensive continuous improvement program cci we grew the second quarter s adjusted operating income 5 or 8 in constant currency and expanded our adjusted operating margin 80 basis points at the bottom line our second quarter adjusted earnings per share of 1 16 was 14 higher than 1 02 in the second quarter of 2018 driven primarily by our adjusted operating income growth and the lower adjusted tax rate and this 14 adjusted earnings per share growth includes an unfavorable impact from currency our second quarter results were solid and we continue to expect another year of strong performance in 2019 we re reaffirming our sales outlook and as mike will explain in detail we are updating our operating profit outlook and increasing our earnings per share outlook i d like to turn now to some business updates with a focus this morning on highlights from our consumer and flavor solutions segments and update on our business transformation activity and our business momentum that reinforces our confidence in the remainder of the year turning on slide 6 with our consumer segment as i just mentioned we grew constant currency sales 2 with increases in each of our three regions in the americas we grew constant currency sales 2 driven by higher volume and product mix a late easter which delayed the start of grilling season tempered sales growth for the quarter we estimate our consumption growth for the quarter including both measured and unmeasured channels was 2 our iri data indicates u s spice and seasoning scanner sales for multi outlets grew 2 for the category and 1 for mccormick branded while the late grilling start slowed the category growth it had a greater impact on our consumption we again had strong growth in unmeasured channels including club e commerce and hispanic retail chains our category management initiatives effective marketing support merchandising execution expanded distribution and new products contributed to drive consumption growth across our americas consumer portfolio mccormick branded dry recipe mixes and stubb s barbecue continued their momentum of consumption and share growth zatarain s frozen items both base business and new products drove growth frank s redhot sauce continued strong performance with distribution gains with total distribution points hitting a record high and with our category management initiatives and focused marketing support french s mustard grew consumption and share we believe these actions will continue to drive consumption and sales growth in the second half of the year now turning to europe middle east and africa the emea region constant currency growth was driven by very strong promotional programs and targeted brand marketing across the region expanded distribution and new products were also growth drivers we had broad based growth across most of the region including strength in eastern europe we re excited by our continued momentum on new product launches and the successes we ve realized to date with more flavors and varieties to come as well as further distribution expansion in the asia pacific region we built further momentum of frank s and french s particularly in china india and australia the foundation we continue to establish while still early days is driving results although growth in the region has been partially impacted by recent macroeconomic pressures in china our fundamentals across the region remain strong turning now to slide 7 in our flavor solutions segment our sales performance was strong our constant currency sales growth was 4 driven by higher volume and product mix on base business as well as new products we re continuing to win with our customers through new products expanded distribution and promotional activities in the americas we drove constant currency sales growth of 3 we had strong sales growth to quick service restaurants as well as in our flavor product category our flavor sales were driven by snack seasonings partially due to new products and our customers promotions and by products that deliver the clean label and better for you attributes our customers are seeking we also had strong branded foodservice growth driven by increased distribution with national and regional customers promotional activity with operators and expansion in emerging channels in branded foodservice we continue to realize the benefit of leveraging our full portfolio of mccormick spices and seasonings and frank s french s and cattlemen s products across operators our strong momentum in emea was once again reflected in our second quarter results sales growth was outstanding 9 in constant currency and was broad based across the portfolio both from a product category and customer perspective we drove sales growth to quick service restaurants partially due to their strong promotional activity and to packaged food companies with new products being a key driver turning now to slide 8 as we previously discussed most recently at cagny we are making investments to build the mccormick of the future including in our global enablement organization to transform mccormick through globally aligned innovative services enabling the business to grow as technology provides the backbone for this greater process alignment information sharing and scalability we re also making investments in our information systems we have progressed our erp replacement program and accelerated the transformation of our ways of working this will enable us to realize the benefits of a scalable platform for growth sooner we have estimated the total cost of our erp investment to range between 150 million and 200 million from 2019 through the anticipated completion of our global rollout in fiscal 2021 the capital spend portion is estimated to be 90 million to 120 million and program expenses 60 million to 80 million mike will discuss this further in his remarks next as we are at the midpoint of the year i d like to share a few comments about the momentum we are carrying into the balance of the year our largest quarters are ahead of us and as we have remarked previously our operating profit growth is weighted toward the second half of our year as seen on slide 9 our confidence for the second half has bolstered first by our plans for a strong americas fall and holiday season partially driven by a significant increase in brand marketing we continue to optimize our brand marketing spend both in terms of working and nonworking mix as well as in timing increasing our effectiveness and getting more value out of each marketing dollar we have intentionally skewed our brand marketing spend to be heavier later in the year to maximize our roi and support the key holiday period additionally we have robust brand marketing investments planned in support of the significant array of new products we ve launched across all regions during our first half and are now gaining momentum in distribution and we have exciting additional new product launches in our second half this new product lineup includes in the u s street tacos following the successful u k street food launch complete meal seasonings a package of complementary seasonings for our consumers protein vegetables and starch and thai kitchen coconut milk in a resealable tetra package in emea in addition to flavor and geographic extensions we ll be launching premium grinders and in china we re launching a full range of thick texture salad dressings and light meal sauces our confidence is also driven by new distribution we ve successfully secured realizing the benefits of distribution gained throughout the first half of the year across both our consumer and flavor solutions segments and in flavor solutions we expect continued momentum and wins with our customers through new products and promotional activities finally as we ve mentioned previously we will be lapping several onetime items which impacted us unfavorably in late 2018 such as the unusual fourth quarter impacts we had in the americas consumer business and our move to a new global headquarters we re excited about our plans and confident in delivering strong sales growth in our second half as well as significant profit realization while continuing to invest in the business now i d like to provide a few summary comments as seen on slide 10 before turning it over to mike at the foundation of our sales growth is the rising consumer demand for flavor we are aligned with the consumers increased interest in bolder flavors demand for convenience and focus on fresh natural ingredients as well as with emerging purchase drivers such as greater transparency around the sourcing and quality of food with this increased interest flavor continues to be an advantaged global category which combined with our execution against effective strategies will drive strong results we have a solid foundation and in an environment that continues to be dynamic and fast paced we are ensuring we remain agile relevant and focused on sustainable growth our experienced leaders and employees are executing against our strategies which are designed to build long term value for our shareholders our second quarter financial results across both our consumer and flavor solutions segments contributed to a great first half of the fiscal year our fundamentals are strong and we re confident the initiatives we have under way position us to continue our growth trajectory we re balancing our resources and efforts to drive sales with a work to lower costs to build fuel for growth and higher margin while making the investments in our future we have confidence in our updated fiscal year outlook and we are well positioned to deliver another strong year in 2019 we remain excited as we enter our second half and continue to drive results around the world mccormick employees are driving our momentum and success and i thank them for their efforts and engagement thank you for your attention and it is now my pleasure to turn it over to mike for additional remarks on our second quarter financial results and our updated 2019 outlook mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks lawrence and good morning everyone as lawrence indicated we delivered solid second quarter results in line with our expectations i ll begin with a discussion of our results and then follow with details of our full year 2019 financial outlook turning on slide 12 we grew sales 3 in constant currency and as lawrence mentioned earlier this was entirely organic growth driven by the base business and new products as we had no acquisition impact in the quarter both our consumer and flavor solutions segments delivered top line constant currency growth in each of our three regions the consumer segment grew sales 2 in constant currency this growth was driven by all three regions and was attributable to expanded distribution new products and pricing on slide 13 consumer segment sales in the americas rose 2 in constant currency versus the second quarter of 2018 this increase was driven by higher volume and product mix including zatarain s products frank s redhot sauces branded extracts and our branded hispanic products partially tempered by the delayed grilling season start in emea constant currency consumer sales were up 1 from a year ago higher volume and product mix were driven by new products distribution gains and promotional activities this growth was partially offset by a decline in private label as well as pricing actions including those related to planned trade promotional activity for new products we grew consumer sales in the asia pacific region 3 with growth in india and australia driven by our marketing programs as well as expanded distribution additionally china pricing actions were partially offset by related volume impacts as well as the macroeconomic pressures lawrence mentioned earlier turning to our flavors solutions segment on slide 16 we grew second quarter constant currency sales 4 with growth in all three regions led by strength in emea in the americas flavor solutions constant currency sales increased 3 with broad based growth across the portfolio excluding a decline in bulk ingredients new products expanded distribution and our customer promotional activities all contributed to the sales increase in emea we grew flavor solutions sales 9 in constant currency across both packaged food companies and quick service restaurants partially due to their promotional activity this growth was driven by new products pricing and base business volume growth and spanned all categories in the asia pacific region flavor solutions sales in constant currency grew 2 versus the year ago period as higher sales to quick service restaurants were partially driven by the timing of the promotional activities across both segments adjusted operating income which excludes special charges and for 2018 the transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition of our frank s and french s brands rose 5 in the second quarter versus the year ago period and excluding the impact of unfavorable currency rose 8 adjusted operating income in the consumer segment rose to 138 million a 7 increase adjusted operating income in the flavor solutions segment rose to 77 million a 2 increase in constant currency adjusted operating income increased 9 in consumer segment and 5 in the flavor solutions segment in both segments the increase was primarily driven by cci led cost savings higher sales and lower brand marketing expenses the impact of these drivers in the flavor solutions segment was partially offset by an unfavorable transactional impact of foreign currency exchange rates as well as unfavorable mix related to a sales shift in quick service restaurants from limited time offers to core menu items as seen on slide 21 in the second quarter we increased gross profit margin 30 basis points year on year driven by cci led cost savings our selling general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales decreased by 50 basis points from the second quarter of 2018 this decrease was primarily driven by lower brand marketing investments which as lawrence mentioned earlier is partially driven by timing and through our new marketing excellence organization we are increasing our efficiency and speed as well as realizing brand marketing cci through the creation of in house services and consolidated media buys as a reminder while our first half brand marketing is lower than last year we are planning to spend brand marketing comparable to 2018 partially by reinvesting our continued marketing excellence cost savings and nonworking media spend reductions into working media therefore we are planning brand marketing increases in our second half sg a leverage gained from cci led cost savings initiatives and onetime global benefit plan alignment was offset by business transformation expenses driven by our erp platform replacement in fiscal year 2019 we expect the erp expenses to be concentrated in our second and third quarters the combination of the gross margin expansion and the overall sg a leverage resulted in an adjusted operating margin expansion of 80 basis points for the second quarter of 2019 turning to income taxes on slide 22 our second quarter adjusted effective income tax rate was 18 9 as compared to 22 2 in the year ago period our second quarter adjusted rate was favorably impacted by discrete tax items principally due to stock option exercises as we have discussed in previous quarters favorable tax rate impacts of option exercises are partially offset by payroll and social related taxes which unfavorably impact operating profit considering the year to date favorable impact from discrete items we now expect our full year 2019 adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 21 there can be volatility in that rate quarter to quarter due to the unpredictability of discrete items changes to our forecasted mix of earnings and interpretation of regulations continuing to be released clarifying the impacts of the 2017 u s tax act income from unconsolidated operations was 10 million compared to 7 million in the second quarter of 2018 a 28 increase driven by excellent performance by our mccormick de mexico joint venture for 2019 we now expect a high single digit increase in our income from unconsolidated operations at the bottom line as shown on slide 24 second quarter 2019 adjusted earnings per share was 1 16 up 14 from 1 02 for the year ago period primarily due to growth in our operating performance including from our joint ventures and a lower adjusted income tax rate and this increase included an unfavorable impact from currency the company continues to generate strong cash flow on slide 25 we ve summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter end balance sheet our cash flow provided from operations was 314 million through the second quarter of 2019 compared to 235 million from the first half of 2018 our strong operating cash flow was driven by higher operating income and our continued working capital initiatives as we execute against programs to achieve working capital reductions including inventory management programs we continue to see improvements in our cash conversion cycle finishing the second quarter down six days versus our fiscal year end a portion of this cash was used to pay down 88 million of acquisition debt as the company continues to focus on paying down debt as we have maintained our disciplined acquisition strategy with a focus on paying down debt we finished the second quarter with a debt to adjusted ebitda ratio below four times which is pacing us ahead of our target of three times by the end of 2020 so as lawrence mentioned during the first quarter earnings call while our priority is paying down debt it is also time for us to start exploring acquisition opportunities which represent a key part of our long term growth strategy for the first half of fiscal 2019 we returned 151 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and used 54 million for capital expenditures this period we expect 2019 to be another year of strong cash flow driven by profit and working capital initiatives and our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash making investments to drive growth returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and to pay down debt let s now move to our current financial outlook for 2019 on slide 26 we continue to expect another year of strong performance in 2019 with our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio effective growth strategies and focus on profit realization we are reaffirming our sales outlook and updating our operating profit and earnings per share outlook we continue to estimate based on prevailing rates a two percentage point unfavorable impact from currency rates on net sales adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share we also continue to expect the unfavorable currency will be greater in the first half of the year than in the second half at the top line we reaffirm our guidance to grow sales 1 to 3 which in constant currency is a 3 to 5 projected growth rate as a reminder this will be entirely organic growth driven primarily by higher volume and product mix as well as the impact of pricing to offset an anticipated low single digit cost increase we continue to project our 2019 gross profit margin to be 25 to 75 basis points higher than in 2018 in part driven by our cci led cost savings we re now expecting our adjusted operating income growth to be 6 to 8 from 930 million in 2018 which in constant currency is an 8 to 10 projected growth rate remaining above our long term objective and reflects our continued focus on profit realization our cost savings target remains approximately 110 million and we expect brand marketing to be comparable to 2018 our updated adjusted operating income growth rate continues to reflect expected strong performance the decrease from the outlook last year during our march earnings call reflects the impacts of a classification shift in our erp spending the operating expense headwind related to option exercises which partially offset the tax benefit and global developments including trade and economic conditions in selected countries as lawrence mentioned we are progressing our erp replacement program and while our estimated total 2019 project investment related to this business transformation has remained unchanged we now expect a lower 2019 capital spend component and higher operating expenses than we had originally expected for 2019 resulting from this classification shift we are lowering our 2019 capital spend outlook to approximately 200 million and our 2019 updated operating profit outlook reflects the increased expense we are excited about this investment to enable us to transform our ways of working and realize the benefits of a scalable growth platform we are increasing our guidance for 2019 adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of 5 20 to 5 30 which compares to 4 97 of adjusted earnings per share in 2018 and represents a 5 to 7 increase or in constant currency 7 to 9 this increase reflects the impact of changes i previously mentioned our updated adjusted operating income outlook the expected increase in income from unconsolidated operations and the projected lower adjusted effective tax rate in summary we continue to project strong growth in our 2019 constant currency outlook for sales adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share following record double digit performance across each objective in 2018 and while continuing to invest for future growth i d like to now turn it back to lawrence for some additional remarks before we move to your questions lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer thank you mike now that mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more detail i d like to recap the key takeaways as seen on slide 27 we re delivering against our plans both for sales and profit realization and are confident in the momentum of our business with our year to date results we have a strong start to the year moving into our second half we re confident in our plans including brand marketing support new product launches and new distribution which will drive further growth our 2019 outlook continues to reflect strong operating performance and finally we are sustainably positioned for growth and are continuing to deliver differentiated results while also investing to build the mccormick of the future now let s turn to your questions questions answers operator our first question comes from the line of andrew lazar with barclays andrew lazar barclays analyst hi good morning everybody lawrence i know that last quarter was one of the first in probably a couple of years where mccormick actually gained share in the core spices and seasonings business in the u s and i know that s something that obviously you ve been narrowing the gap quite a bit with the category and then flipped to gaining some share i think your comment in 2q was that the delayed the easter delay around grilling season i think you worded it it hit mccormick or affected mccormick at a greater rate than let s say the category and so it looked like there was a little bit of a share loss i m just trying to get a sense of why that dynamic would ve played out for mccormick differently than let s say the category and if there s any change in sort of the cadence of continuing to feel better about share gains going forward lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer right sure andrew well first of all it s not easter it s the grilling season that was the issue easter fell later in the calendar we actually had a great easter season but the late easter did compress the grilling season and that compression of the grilling season impacted our grilling products and seasonally our grilling season items particularly our grill mates seasoning blends are a big part of our business at this time of year we didn t mention it in our prepared remarks but it was also an exceptionally wet season so the quarter was i think the fifth wettest on record and may was the second wettest on record and just the combination of the slow the late grilling season that compression of the grilling season and some unfavorable weather was a headwind to our grill mates range so that caused us to pace behind the category i think the whole category was somewhat depressed by the compression of that grilling season we re not the only ones to have a grilling range so but we re the market leader in the grill mates range it s a big part of our business at this time of the year so category was only up about 2 we were only up about 1 in terms of spices and seasonings for the quarter and we lost about 30 basis points of share although we re getting into a stronger position from a share gain standpoint there are going to be some moving parts i d say that 30 basis points is not something that we are concerned about that we ve had a good strong underlying trend and i also want to point out that the unmeasured channels are not captured in that and we continue to have very strong growth in the unmeasured channel area that does not come through that consumption data i ll also point out that private label also lost share so while there had been a lot of concerns about private label in the market private label is becoming less and less of a factor so that s not that came in operator our next question comes from the line of david driscoll with citi research david driscoll citi research analyst thank you and good morning two questions for me just on the operating profit guide down can you just talk about the environment outside the united states and the impact to your operating profit guidance and then just a longer term question lawrence wanted to get your sense as to the in home cooking trends i just i think they are quite positive right now but wanted to get your sense as to as the u s unemployment rate remains very very low how do you see those in home trends continuing over the course of kind of medium term do you think that the low unemployment will drive the people out to the restaurants or do you really see in home cooking as a sustainable driver even with this very very low unemployment rate lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer i m going to let mike take the front end of that mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i ll talk about the change in operating profit guidance was really driven primarily by the shift from capital to expense in the erp side of things in the global economic environment as you mentioned was a small piece of that but i would just characterize things as volatile right now we ve talked about how we ve had mitigation plans for brexit and emea that s on again off again it s been longer than we would have thought at this point we had the mexico scare about a month ago we have significant business down there and we have the china slowdown china had the slowest growth from a gdp perspective in 20 years in their first quarter so it s really volatile now and we kind of consider that for our ongoing operating profit guidance for this year but the real change versus our previous guidance is due to just a classification shift on erp lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer and as far as eating out trends this is a long term trend unemployment has been very low for quite a long time i think that this cooking at home trend is more a characteristic of the millennial generation and is not being driven by economic factors it s being more driven by a desire for more fresh food and a different kind of lifestyle and so i think that the unemployment rate i think that that trend continues intact in the short medium and long term operator our next question comes from the line of ken goldman with jp morgan ken goldman j p morgan analyst thanks good morning everybody two questions for me and if you addressed this forgive me i have a couple earnings this morning but number one you re looking for a very big jump in the tax rate in the second half but historically you ve consistently i would i think it s fair to say over guided when it comes to taxes just to be conservative perhaps and which is great but just to be aligned with history why shouldn t we model a little bit of a lower tax rate than what you ve guided to for the second half and then my second question is i wanted to get a sense the economic conditions you mentioned in china was that more on the foodservice side on the retail side i just wanted to get a little bit more color on exactly what the headwind is there mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer it s mike i ll talk about the taxes i mean we talked about this in the past i mean you re right generally we guide to an underlying tax rate based on regulations and things it has gotten a bit volatile the last couple of years when the accounting rules changed around stock option discrete items stock option exercises what we try to do is lay out the underlying and if there s discrete items like that that happen that is a favorable to us and we ve seen that through the first half of the year i mean one of the things with our stock appreciation over the last couple of years there s been significant stock option exercises a lot by retirees and that does also drive some unfavorable from an operating profit perspective and it puts more shares out there too so it isn t all something to drop to the bottom line from a tax perspective but second half if you do the squeeze there s 24 to 25 that is the underlying tax rate and as we know with the gilti tax and other things that are still uncertain from the federal government it could go either way but i d look to the past a bit but we ve had in the last year real significant discrete items from stock options which may or may not continue lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer and that s retiree stock option exercises i ll add some color to that the so on china that s a really good question ken the slowdown there is an economic slowdown in china as we all know we suspect that the official figures are probably optimistic and that maybe the slowdown in china is even greater than would appear from the government statistics that are released i m saying that as nicely as i can and it is the case that we re seeing the biggest impact in the restaurant sector in china our consumer business includes a foodservice component because they share a common distribution channel particularly in the traditional trade and in the smaller markets and that those foodservice related items are where we re seeing some impact and anecdotally we re certainly getting a lot of feedback from our organization in china that foodservice and restaurant sales that are slow over in our flavor solutions side of the business our customers are more focused on core products as a result because they re trying to drive value to the restaurant and bring people in so i think that the economic conditions are having a greater impact on foodservice and restaurant consumption than on the true retail part of the business where our retails related items continue to show very strong growth and our e commerce business which is consumer oriented continues to show really strong growth in that area there is another compounding factor and that is this african swine fever this caused starting to show up as a meat shortage and rising meat prices in china which puts cost pressure on the whole foodservice sector there of course that bleeds over to all the alternative meats as well and with the resulting price impacted the consumer who s going through different foodservice outlets so that s a little bit of a longish answer but it is more foodservice than retail operator our next question comes from the line of alexia howard with bernstein alexia howard sanford c bernstein analyst good morning everyone so two questions the first one on the consumer americas business and the fact that it was i guess negatively affected by the shorter grilling season maybe the wet weather hit things a little hard this time as well does that mean we would expect to go back to a more normal level of sales growth starting next quarter is there anything sort of out there that would say it wouldn t sort of start to get back to a more normal level next time and then a more specific question on the emea flavor solutions business obviously very strong this time around was that largely based on you mentioned the qsr promotions but were there also new contract wins i just wanted to get an idea of whether that strength is likely to be sustainable lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer ok those thanks alexia we did you started your question before we could say hi the consumer americas specifically first of all i don t want to apologize too much for the organic growth that we re having there some of our peers are reporting right around us see quite a differential between what we re reporting and what they are i think that we did have solid organic sales growth and i don t want us to lose the thread of thought on that but we are expecting a stronger second half to the year than the first half and i think that we ve been trying to signal that all year long right from the guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year and even in our remarks at the end of first quarter our marketing spend is deliberately skewed to the second half of the year whereas the strongest roi our new product launches in the first half we get the benefit of that in the second half we have more new products that we re launching in the second half of the year as well we are going to be lapping some americas anomalies in the fourth quarter that we don t expect to repeat so overall we are expecting higher organic sales growth in the americas as we go through the second half if i could shift gears over to the emea flavor solutions business it s both so this is a continuation of the strong trend that we saw in the first quarter in that business in terms of the constant currency growth it s actually exactly the same as it was in the first quarter and it s driven by the same factors we have we do have some new customer wins but we also have strong growth with our existing customer base there operator our next question comes from the line of robert moskow with credit suisse robert moskow credit suisse analyst so the guidance for the year has always involved or required a lot of operating leverage a little bit less now with the operating income down 1 can you talk a little bit more detail about the transformation spending that you re doing the erp and how can you give us some specific details on how that can release more cost savings going forward you mentioned some efficiencies but are there any headcount implications heading into the next two years from what you re doing with erp mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer this is mike i mean this is a three year initiative and we re in year one of the three years and we laid out the capital and the expense portions of that that we ll realize over the three years we did talk about the shift and it s really primarily a lot of our expenses happening in the second and third quarter of this year that will shift to more of the capital side of things but really we re focusing on this business transformation of erp as really a growth initiative and it will give us efficiencies no question as we standardize processes around the world as we do things one way around the world it s really to make sure we can focus our resources on growing the business bringing in acquisitions much easier we in the past as we brought in acquisitions it s been tough and it takes a lot of effort from the organization so i think that s something i d focus from a growth perspective as we continue to get more and more scale to be a bigger company this is really an investment in our business to get us to the next level lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer i ll add to that a little bit rob and that is that this is linked also to our global enablement program where we re simplifying our processes aligning them globally so we can centralize them and that definitely both enables us to be more agile and grow and it also does absolutely result in cost savings because we get we do get a benefit from that scale so this is a technology enabling part of that global enablement project as part of this we are also as a technology upgrade we are making the migration to the next generation of sap s 4hana the whole industry is going to have to go to that most some of us have but most of us have not yet started that journey it is if you are doing it on a pretty brisk pace as we are minimum of a 3 year project sap goes out of service in 2025 we want to be well ahead of that curve and we see this as an opportunity rather than as a cost that we have to bear down the road robert moskow credit suisse analyst ok a quick follow up though i thought i heard you say that you re in a better position to make acquisitions now can you did i hear that correctly and if so what capabilities are you focused on acquiring mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer as we move down toward the three times debt to ebitda i think that was what we were saying as we get closer to our commitment that allows us to start looking at acquisitions lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer exactly we re not and the kind of acquisitions that we would look for will be consistent with what we ve done and messaged in the past great flavor businesses great consumer brands that build our consumer flavor business flavor solutions businesses that add flavor capability and capacity and those will be the main areas mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer and businesses that grow lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer and of course businesses mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer we obviously don t do without growth robert moskow credit suisse analyst got it so three times is really the trigger mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer no lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer you can say that s a trigger but we ve said we ve always committed to that is that we re going to get to three times by the end of 2020 and as we get as we re closing in on that we re not going to start working on deals once we get to three right now we ve got a debt to ebitda ratio that starts with three and we re on track to end up with mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer yes the back end of the year rob is all heavy cash flow by the end of the year we will be in sight robert moskow credit suisse analyst yes yes i thought ok thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of adam samuelson with goldman sachs adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst yes thanks good morning everyone so a question on the flavor solutions business and really centered on the margin side can you quantify the transactional fx headwind that you re facing there i m just and the spirit of the question is the first half organic growth from the business is a little bit north of 5 and margin on a year on year basis are up 10 20 basis points and i m just trying to think about the operating leverage within that mix doesn t seem like it s a headwind especially when you talk about the bulk ingredients business being down so i m just trying to make sure i m understanding kind of some of the costs or margin pressures that are hitting you there and how to think about that going forward mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer so i think you can think about it in a couple of factors that are actually hitting us in the flavor solutions side the transactional fx as you said which has been hitting us the last six months of last year and the first six months of this year we ll get into a more favorable fx comparison in the second 6 so that should be an acceleration there we re also as lawrence mentioned in asia particularly in china as we kind of have a negative mix issue right now as the qsrs are focused more on their core products versus the ltos or limited time offers we make more margin obviously on limited time offers so but we see that again that ebbs and flows and as the economies recover we think we ll go back to more ltos and we re actually seeing a little bit of that in some of the areas so i see an acceleration of our operating margin on the flavor solutions side in the second half as those clouds go away lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer yes particularly that fx is going to be less unfavorable in the second half now we ll i ll temper both of our remarks with the caveat that this has really been a volatile environment and we re but the fx outlook that we have right now we should be getting into comparisons that are pretty close year on year adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst ok and then just quickly on the jv you took up the range for earnings growth in that line item is that just a reflection of the first half performance where you re above the high end of the kind of upper single digit growth or is the full year is the back half actually improving there too lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer yes if i can jump in on that so we re having really strong sales growth in our mix jv and that s falling through to profitability so the performance year to date there has been really good we have positive outcomes and so originally our outlook on our jvs as a group was flat we re in this pretty strong place right now and so we have a it s a little bit of both we have great results here to date and we expect that to continue and i also wanted to really call this out because we don t talk about the unconsolidated operations but those are real operating results we are not passive operators of our unconsolidated jvs and just in the last few weeks both mike and i have been down there multiple times these are businesses that we re actively engaged in mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer and doing very well lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer and doing very well operator our next question comes from the line of chris growe with stifel chris growe stifel financial corp analyst all right i just had two questions if i could i want to follow up on an earlier discussion of obviously a bit of a delay in the grilling season i guess i wanted to be clear is that something if you get back you get those sales back say starting in q3 that this sort of pent up demand by consumers that got pushed out of it is that the way to look at it or is it more of potential for loss sales given promotional changes there lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer no i think that if i could i know you said you had two parts i m going to just jump in and answer i think the consumption that didn t happen didn t happen it was that compression is also something that we ve had discussions about with our customers as well so and so there was lost merchandising activity the customers couldn t get their easter promotions down fast enough to get the grilling promotion display materials up and what the consumers didn t consume because remember we talked about through the scanner that the grill mates the grilling part of our seasoning business is the part that was slow and that s consumption that is that s really lost mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer but it s something we planned internally everyone knows when easter was going to hit we move some advertising into the third quarter you re going to see a nice up spend in the third quarter which hopefully will continue to drive good consumption chris growe stifel financial corp analyst ok great and then in relation to the gross margin how would you characterize cost inflation and pricing are those two roughly estimates i know you did mention that cci was the main driver of your gross margin improvement and maybe related to that in terms of the cci savings are they more gross margin focused this year versus sg a or if you have any color there just would be interested in that mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i wouldn t say from a cci perspective we haven t seen a large shift between cost of goods sold cci or sg a cci i think from a pricing perspective and a cost perspective as we said at the beginning of the year this is a relatively benign environment for us low single digit cost inflation and we take up some pricing where we needed to do that this year but it s a relatively benign size so the cci is able to work for us better to drop through to the operating profit margin lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer and we have some ongoing discussions on price on specific items as well that are always in progress operator our next question comes from the line of rob dickerson with deutsche bank rob dickerson deutsche bank analyst just kind of an overview question on guidance in the back half given all the questions that have already been asked so it seems like what you re saying and kind of what i m hearing is there was maybe a little bit extra spend on the erp system upgrade i guess right i guess the shift to mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer it s a shift rob it s going from capital to expense if you noticed we talked about it in the script our capital range was 200 million to 220 million we ve shifted that down to 200 million now for the year so capital is down expense is up think about it that way lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer it s the same money mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer same cash lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer on the fixed notes right mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer right rob dickerson deutsche bank analyst right so and i mean at times i actually am very ignorant i do admit that so could you just explain that simplistically so everybody on the call can understand mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer yes ok that s fine i mean i can talk for hours about the accounting around this but i won t but it s one of the things when we came into the year and as lawrence talked about in the january call we were starting to engage our system integrator to look at the scope of the project the timing and we had an estimate of what the total cost would be over this couple of years and based on what we knew at the time based on the phases of the project and what is capital what is expense from an accounting perspective we took our best crack at it once the system integrator got in and put the plan together we realized that ok there s a little bit more expense upfront than we thought a little less capital based on the work that they re doing on the erp design the implementation all that sort of stuff so that s where what you see here total cost is going to be about the same it s just a shift between the two based on the accounting rules and better in preparing right now rob dickerson deutsche bank analyst ok good answer and then just secondly and simplistically it sounds like what you re saying is in the back half right given i guess sounds like there s been a little margin mix pressure is not a lot but like you said it kind of restaurants relative to kind of base core retail in asia let s ignore the erp piece for a second but then in the back half maybe some of that loose ends we ll see but it s also there s fx reversal not a full reversal but less of a headwind and then it also sounds like maybe that you re coming out of this kind of late wet post easter grilling season that maybe with marketing dollars you can improve velocities and hopefully also improve some margin mix because when i just look at the guide right and you talked about some of the shift in the grilling season in the quarter or what happened in china but quite frankly your top line is actually still pretty strong and you re exactly in line for the most part where you were relative to q1 on a tier stack basis so it is it seems like it s more of a margin expansion expectation in the back half versus a big top line acceleration relative to the first half is that a fair summary mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i think you got that right robin you remember the fourth quarter some of the challenges we re going to have a really favorable mix in the back half compared to 2018 based on what we saw last year and the other thing someone mentioned cci before cci built during the year so that does help margin also lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer right and rob i m glad you made a point about the sales growth being solid and look take just a step back on the whole overall picture because like last quarter this was really a solid no drama quarter we put together two pretty undramatic solid performances year over year we had solid sales growth in this quarter nearly 3 in constant currency which compares very strongly to our peers through the first half a little over 3 5 on all of sales growth constant currency all of it organic and as we ve signaled all year we expect a stronger second half we ve had good operating profit growth and margin expansion it s actually in line with our algorithm and quarter by quarter we re putting together a strong 2019 we re very confident in our outlook on the second half and i think that so it s a some really good points you raised operator thank you and ladies and gentlemen this concludes our question and answer session i ll turn the floor back to mr kurzius for any final

ap fact check trump s misfires on iran trade and that wall washington ap in president donald trump s reckoning an iran tamed by him no longer cries death to america the border wall with mexico is proceeding apace the estate tax has been lifted off the backs of farmers the remains of u s soldiers from north korea are coming home and china is opening its wallet to the u s treasury for the first time in history these statements range from flatly false to mostly so here s a week of political rhetoric in review iran trump speaking about iranians screaming death to america when barack obama was in the white house they haven t screamed death to america lately fox news interview friday the facts yes they have the death to america chant is heard routinely president donald trump speaks in the rose garden of the white house friday june 14 2019 in washington ap photo jacquelyn martin the chant marg bar amreeka in farsi dates back even before iran s 1979 islamic revolution once used by communists it was popularized by ayatollah ruhollah khomeini the revolution s figurehead and iran s first supreme leader after the u s embassy takeover by militants it remains a staple of hard line demonstrations meetings with current supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei official ceremonies parliamentary sessions and main friday prayer services in tehran and across the country some masters of ceremonies ask audiences to tone it down but it was heard for example from the crowd this month when khamenei exhorted thousands to stand up against u s bullying in one variation a demonstrator at tehran s quds rally last month held a sign with three versions of the slogan death to america in farsi death to america in arabic down with u s a in english ___ wages and taxes trump wages are growing and they are growing at the fastest rate for this is something so wonderful for blue collar workers the biggest percentage increase blue collar workers remarks tuesday in council bluffs iowa the facts he s claiming credit for a trend of rising wages for lower income blue collar workers that predates his presidency some of the gains also reflect higher minimum wages passed at the state and local level the trump administration opposes an increase to the federal minimum wage with the unemployment rate at 3 6 the lowest since december 1969 employers are struggling to fill jobs despite all the talk of robots and automation thousands of restaurants warehouses and retail stores still need workers they are offering higher wages and have pushed up pay for the lowest paid one quarter of workers more quickly than for everyone else since 2015 in april the poorest 25 saw their paychecks increase 4 4 from a year earlier compared with 3 1 for the richest one quarter those gains are not necessarily flowing to the blue collar workers trump cited instead when measured by industry wages are rising more quickly for lower paid service workers hourly pay for retail workers has risen 4 1 in the past year and 3 8 for hotel and restaurant employees manufacturing workers the blue collars have seen pay rise just 2 2 and construction workers 3 2 ___ trump and to keep your family farms and ranches in the family we eliminated the estate tax also known as the death tax on the small farms and ranches and other businesses that was a big one people were having a farm they loved their children and they want to leave it to their children and the estate tax was so much the children would have to go out and borrow a lot of money from unfriendly bankers in many cases and they d end up losing the farm and it was a horrible situation remarks in council bluffs the facts there still is an estate tax more small farms may be off the hook for it as a result of changes by the republican controlled congress in 2017 but very few farms or small businesses were subject to the tax even before that happened congress increased the tax exemption temporarily so fewer people will be subject to those taxes previously any assets from estates valued at more than 5 49 million or nearly 11 million for couples were subject to the estate tax in 2017 the new law doubled that minimum for 2018 to 11 2 million or 22 4 million for couples for 2019 the minimums rose to 11 4 million or 22 8 million for couples those increased minimums will expire at the end of 2025 according to an analysis by the nonpartisan tax policy center only about 80 small farms and closely held businesses were subject to the estate tax in 2017 those estates represent about 1 percent of all taxable estate tax returns ___ north korea trump i think we re going to do very well with north korea over a period of time i m in no rush our remains are coming back you saw the beautiful ceremony in hawaii with mike pence we re getting the remains back joint news conference wednesday with poland s president the facts the u s is not currently getting additional remains of american service members killed during the korean war with u s north korea relations souring the pentagon said last month it had suspended its efforts to arrange negotiations this year on recovering additional remains of american service members the pentagon said it hoped to reach agreement for recovery operations in 2020 the defense pow mia accounting agency said it has had no communication with north korean authorities since the vietnam summit between trump and north korean leader kim jong un in february that meeting focused on the north s nuclear weapons and followed a june 2018 summit where kim committed to permitting a resumption of u s remains recovery that effort had been suspended by the u s in 2005 the agency said it had reached the point where we can no longer effectively plan coordinate and conduct field operations with the north during this budget year which ends sept 30 last summer in line with the first trump kim summit in june the north turned over 55 boxes of what it said were the remains of an undetermined number of u s service members killed in the north during the 1950 53 war so far six americans have been identified from the 55 boxes u s officials have said the north has suggested in recent years that it holds perhaps 200 sets of american war remains thousands more are unrecovered from battlefields and former pow camps the pentagon estimates that about 5 300 americans were lost in north korea ___ border wall trump we re building a wall and by next year at the end of the year we re going to have close to 500 miles of wall remarks tuesday at the republican party of iowa annual dinner trump we re going to have close to 500 miles of wall built by the end of next year that s a lot and we re moving along very rapidly we won the big court case as you know the other day and that was a big victory for us remarks monday with indianapolis 500 champions the facts he s being overly optimistic it s unclear how trump arrives at 500 miles 800 km but he would have to prevail in legal challenges to his declaration of a national emergency or get congress to cough up more money to get anywhere close those are big assumptions and by far the majority of the wall he s talking about is replacement barrier not new miles of construction so far the administration has awarded contracts for 247 miles 395 km of wall construction but more than half comes from defense department money available under trump s feb 15 emergency declaration on may 24 a federal judge in california who was appointed by obama blocked trump from building key sections of the wall with that money in a separate case a federal judge in the nation s capital who was appointed by trump sided with the administration but that ruling has no effect while the california injunction is in place even if trump prevails in court all but 17 miles 27 km of his awarded contracts replace existing barriers the white house says it has identified up to 8 1 billion in potential money under the national emergency mostly from the defense department customs and border protection officials say the administration wants congress to finance 206 miles 330 km next year the chances of the democratic controlled house backing that are between slim and none ___ trade trump right now we re getting 25 on 250 billion worth of goods that s a lot of money that s pouring into our treasury we ve never gotten 10 cents from china now we re getting a lot of money from china remarks monday trump we re taking in right now billions and billions of dollars in tariffs and they re subsidizing product remarks tuesday in council bluffs the facts he s incorrect the tariffs he s raised on imports from china are primarily if not entirely a tax on u s consumers and businesses not a source of significant revenue coming into the country a study in march by economists from the federal reserve bank of new york columbia university and princeton university before the latest escalation found that the public and u s companies were paying 3 billion a month in higher taxes from the trade dispute with china suffering 1 4 billion a month in lost efficiency and absorbing the entire impact it s also false that the u s never collected a dime in tariffs before he took action tariffs on goods from china are not remotely new they are simply higher in some cases than they were before tariffs go back to the beginning of the u s and were once a leading source of revenue for the government not in modern times they equate to less than 1 of federal spending ___ trump look without tariffs we would be captive to every country and we have been for many years that s why we have an 800 billion trading deficit for years we lose a fortune with virtually every country they take advantage of us in every way possible cnbc interview monday the facts trump isn t telling the whole story about trade deficits when he refers to 800 billion trade gaps he s only talking about the deficit in goods such as cars and aircraft he leaves out services such as banking tourism and education in which the u s runs substantial trade surpluses that partially offset persistent deficits in goods the goods and services deficit peaked at 762 billion in 2006 last year the united states ran a record 887 billion deficit in goods and a 260 billion surplus in services which added up to an overall deficit of more than 627 billion the u s does tend to run trade deficits with most other major economies but there are exceptions such as canada a nearly 4 billion surplus last year singapore 18 billion and britain 19 billion mainstream economists reject trump s argument that the deficits arise from other countries taking advantage of the united states they see the trade gaps as the result of an economic reality that probably won t bend to tariffs and other changes in trade policy americans buy more than they produce and imports fill the gap u s exports are also hurt by the american dollar s status as the world s currency the dollar is usually in high demand because it is used in so many global transactions that means the dollar is persistently strong raising prices of u s products and putting american companies at a disadvantage in foreign markets ___ trump you know france charges us a lot for the wine and yet we charge them little for french wine so the wineries come to me and they say the california guys they come to me sir we are paying a lot of money to put our products into france and you re letting meaning this country is allowing this french wine which is great we have great wine too allowing it to come in for nothing it is not fair interview monday with cnbc the facts trump who s been in the wine business is technically wrong about france applying tariffs the european union does he s right about a disparity in wine duties tariffs vary by alcohol content and other factors a bottle of white american wine with 13 percent alcohol content imported into the eu carries a customs duty of 10 euro cents just over 11 u s cents a bottle of white wine from the eu exported to the united states has a customs duty of 5 u s cents the gap in duties is narrower for red wine with an alcohol content of 14 5 percent bulk wines are another story the u s tariff is double the eu one a break for american producers because bulk wine represents 25 of the volume of u s wine coming into the eu according to the french wine exporter federation the value of wine imported by france has jumped 200 over a decade americans are the top consumers of french wine exports ___ russia investigation trump on special counsel robert mueller s report the mueller report spoke it said no collusion and no obstruction and no nothing and in fact it said we actually rebuffed your friends from russia that we actually pushed them back we rebuffed them remarks wednesday in oval office the facts he s wrong to repeat the claim that the mueller report found no collusion between russia and the trump campaign it s also false that his campaign in 2016 denied all access to russians nor did the special counsel s report exonerate trump on the question of whether he obstructed justice mueller s two year investigation and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings with russians among them donald trump jr s meeting with a russian lawyer who had promised dirt on clinton on collusion mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term he looked into a potential criminal conspiracy between russia and the trump campaign and said the investigation did not collect sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges on that front mueller noted some trump campaign officials had declined to testify under the fifth amendment or had provided false or incomplete testimony making it difficult to get a complete picture of what happened during the 2016 campaign the special counsel wrote that he cannot rule out the possibility that unavailable information could have cast a different light on the investigation s findings in an interview broadcast wednesday with abc news trump said if a foreign power offered dirt on his 2020 opponent he d be open to accepting it and that he d have no obligation to call in the fbi i think i d want to hear it trump said there s nothing wrong with listening ___ republican sen lindsey graham judiciary committee chairman in response to trump s comments that he d be open to accepting political dirt from foreign adversaries like russia the outrage some of my democratic colleagues are raising about president trump s comments will hopefully be met with equal outrage that their own party hired a foreign national to do opposition research on president trump s campaign tweet thursday the facts graham is making an unequal comparison he seeks to turn the tables on democrats by pointing to their use of a dossier of anti trump research produced by christopher steele a former british intelligence officer that was financed by the democratic party and hillary clinton s campaign graham also insists on equal outrage over democrats using that information from a former intelligence officer of britain an ally with a history of shared intelligence with the u s that s a different story from a foreign adversary such as russia which the mueller report concluded had engaged in sweeping and systematic interference in the 2016 presidential election moreover steele was hired as a private citizen though one with intelligence contacts the mueller report found multiple contacts between the trump campaign and russia and the report said it established that the russian government perceived it would benefit from a trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome and that the campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through russian efforts trump and his gop allies typically point to the steele dossier as the basis for the russia probe but the fbi s investigation began months before it received the dossier ___ trump the democrats were very unhappy with the mueller report so now they re trying to do a do over or a redo and we re not doing that we gave them everything we were the most transparent presidency in history oval office remarks wednesday the facts it s highly dubious to say trump was fully cooperative in the russia investigation trump declined to sit for an interview with mueller s team gave written answers that investigators described as inadequate and incomplete said more than 30 times that he could not remember something he was asked about in writing and according to the report tried to get aides to fire mueller or otherwise shut or limit the inquiry in the end the mueller report found no criminal conspiracy between the trump campaign and russia but left open the question of whether trump obstructed justice according to the report mueller s team declined to make a prosecutorial judgment on whether to charge partly because of a justice department legal opinion that said sitting presidents shouldn t be indicted the report instead factually laid out instances in which trump might have obstructed justice specifically leaving it open for congress to take up the matter ___ federal reserve trump we have people on the fed that really weren t you know they re not my people but they certainly didn t listen to me because they made a big mistake cnbc interview the facts actually most of the members on the fed s board of governors owe their jobs to trump in addition to choosing jerome powell a republican whom obama had named to the fed board to be chairman trump has filled three other vacancies on the board in his first two years in office lael brainard is the only democrat on the board there are still two vacancies on the seven member board trump had earlier intended to nominate two political allies herman cain and stephen moore but both later withdrew in the face of sharp opposition from critics ___ automakers trump tariffs are a great negotiating tool a great revenue producer and most importantly a powerful way to get companies to come to the u s a and to get companies that have left us for other lands to come back home we stupidly lost 30 of our auto business to mexico tweets tuesday trump they took 30 of our automobile companies they moved into mexico all of the people got fired interview monday with cnbc the facts he s incorrect that mexico took 30 of the u s automobile business in the years since the north american free trade agreement took effect in 1994 in 2017 14 of the vehicles sold in the u s were imported from mexico according to the center for automotive research a think tank in ann arbor michigan parts imported from mexico exceed 30 ___ trump if the tariffs went on at the higher level they would all come back tweet tuesday trump what will happen is the companies will move into the united states back where they came from they would all move back if they had to pay a 25 tax or tariff interview monday with cnbc the facts he s wrong to assume that auto companies in mexico would immediately move back to the u s if there were a 25 tariff on mexican made vehicles and parts it takes three years or four years minimum to plan equip and build an auto assembly plant so there would be little immediate impact on production or jobs auto and parts makers are global companies and they would also look to countries without tariffs as a place to move their factories the companies could also just wait until after the 2020 election hoping that if trump is defeated the next president would get rid of the tariffs they re not going to invest in duplicative capacity in response to short term policy incentives said kristen dziczek a vice president at the center for automotive research it is possible that some production could be shifted back to the united states general motors for instance makes about 39 of its full size pickup trucks at a factory in silao mexico mainly light duty versions according to analysts at morningstar if the u s imposed a 25 tariff on assembled automobiles gm could shift some production to a factory in fort wayne indiana that also makes light duty pickups but there are limits that plant already is running on three shifts and is almost near its maximum capacity tariffs on mexico probably would cost auto jobs in the u s too because mexico would almost certainly retaliate with tariffs of its own tariffs on both sides would raise prices of vehicles because automakers probably would pass the charges onto their customers industry experts say higher prices would cause more buyers to shift into the used vehicle market cutting into new vehicle sales tariffs could be higher than 25 because parts go back and forth across the border multiple times in a highly integrated supply chain vehicles built in mexico get 20 to 30 of their parts from the u s so the tariffs would drive up prices there that would hit lower income people hard because automakers produce many lower priced new vehicles in mexico to take advantage of cheaper labor about 62 of u s vehicle and parts exports go to canada and mexico according to the center for automotive research tariffs would add 1 300 to 4 500 to the price of vehicles based just on the cost of parts the center estimated ___ associated press writers eric tucker christopher rugaber martin crutsinger and paul wiseman in washington elliot spagat in san diego

from caribbean news now port au prince haiti for over four months people in haiti have been protesting to demand that president jovenel moïse must resign amid allegations he embezzled hundreds of thousands of dollars of government funds designated for severely needed social programs according to a damaging report on government corruption given to the haitian senate by official auditors on may 31 has initiated recent protests with thousands marching through the capital port au prince and other cities throughout june on june 20 a committee from the organization of american states oas flew to haiti in hopes of lowering the political temperature petrocaribe a government program is at the centre of the 600 page report and demonstrators wrath under petrocaribe a vital oil alliance contracted with nearby venezuela in 2006 haiti the most impoverished nation in the americas saved valuable dollars by borrowing fuel from its oil rich neighbour and delaying payment for up to 25 years governments were deemed to use additional funds to strengthen the economy and finance social programs alternatively at least 2 billion equivalent to almost a quarter of haiti s entire economy for 2017 went unaccounted for and haitians saw few of the assured perks according to demonstrators and local reporters haitian taxpayers still owe venezuela billions of dollars for the borrowed oil the debacle has become a rallying cry for anti corruption protesters numerous of whom refer to themselves as petrochallengers here is what to know about petrocaribe and how it assisted in sparking haiti s demonstrations hugo chávez venezuela s former president created petrocaribe in 2005 venezuela has the world s biggest proven oil reserves the latin american country was producing around 2 5 million barrels of oil per day in the mid 2000s long before its current economic collapse chávez desired to transform those reserves into more important regional control and gain partners against the us in the organization of american states the petrocaribe program was effectively a means for the latin american country to provide other countries development loans but it loaned oil rather than cash venezuela s state oil business sold oil to haiti and 17 other caribbean countries and permitted them to delay payment on 40 percent of what they purchased for up to 25 years imposing an economical rate of interest for the debt recipient governments then sold that oil and utilised the profits to finance social programs with global oil costs at record levels in the initial years of the program the oil sales made a lot of money the program languished after venezuela s economy started to fall apart in 2014 as a dip in the oil cost exposed the consequences of years of mismanagement and corruption venezuela s oil production has fallen to 830 000 barrels per day and it ceased meeting its petrocaribe pledges to haiti in 2018 haiti is one of the most vulnerable members of the petrocaribe deal according to experts at the economist intelligence unit and it s now undergoing fuel deficits as a consequence of the program s deterioration in haiti the petrocaribe cash was precious especially following the 2010 earthquake that obliterated more than 200 000 people and pointed to a continuing cholera outbreak the government was deemed to utilise it to finance healthcare and infrastructure projects it claimed to have funded approximately 400 such projects using nearly 4 billion allocated by petrocaribe oil between 2008 and 2016 but a lack of visible results sparked doubt and in november 2017 a five member commission in the haitian senate reviewed the program and described evidence of widespread dishonesty in the management of the funds under three successive governments during that period the amount of capital in the government treasury was distorted exchange rates were changed and over half of the contracts awarded to businesses to sustain the projects didn t go through the normal government bid process according to the report because the money wasn t from a conventional international aid package analysts say there was little oversight of how governments used the profits and few restrictions on what they could do with it giving an abundant chance for corruption the disappeared money became a heated political embarrassment but the corruption did not initiate protest until after summer 2018 when inflation skyrocketed and government plans to increase fuel taxes prompted hostile demonstrations petrocaribe is partly a cypher for haiti s deep rooted and extensive corruption predicament haiti is listed 161 of 180 countries on watchdog group transparency international s annual corruption perceptions index and questions have also been asked about the disappearance of approximately 13 billion in international funding given to the country after its 2010 earthquake the world bank asserts corruption is a primary cause of haiti s unbelievable levels of poverty moïse was elected in february 2017 after the period the petrocaribe inquiries scrutinised but the report released may 31 the second phase of a three part investigation claims that he assisted in embezzling money from a large petrocaribe project before he came to office when he was head of the company agritrans agritrans was given approximately 700 000 to fix some roads even though its entire businesses were producing bananas on june 12 moïse refuted any wrongdoing and reemphasised that he would not resign notwithstanding the ongoing demonstrations for more on

key overseas markets module shipments during the first quarter were 3 037 megawatts an increase of 50 7 year over year and a decrease of 16 1 sequentially our gross margin was 16 6 up from 14 7 sequentially and 14 4 year over year as we increasingly benefit from a higher proportion of sales being generated by our self produced high efficiency mono products and further reductions in production cost we continue to see strong demand from overseas markets and have secured the vast majority of our order book for the rest of the year the global solar market continues to generate rapid and sustainable growth momentum as grid parity approaches in particular for our high efficiency mono products which are continuously in short supply our global distribution network allowed us to quickly meet growing demand for our high efficiency mono products over the past few quarters as the market transitioned we are accelerating the expansion of our high efficiency mono production capacity and estimate they will account for over 60 of our total shipments for the year on the domestic front policies recently laid out by china s national energy administration are expected to create a strong demand during the second half of the year china is expected to install 40 gw this year european markets continue to perform very well following the cancellation of the minimum import price policy resulting in a surge in demand from price sensitive projects we expect european installations to hit 17 gw this year in the u s recent policy changes exempting bifacial solar modules from section 201 tariffs are expected to further accelerate medium and long term demand and significantly increase the application of bifacial modules the u s is expected to install 12 gw to 15 gw this year we successfully raised us 160 million last month in a follow on offering of adss and concurrent private placement of convertible senior notes which is being deployed to expand our mono wafer and perc cell capacities our new 5 gw mono wafer production facility in leshan sichuan province began trial production this month and will ramp up to full capacity by the fourth quarter of this year this new production facility will serve as a benchmark for the industry with its cutting edge technology and industry leading cost structure the additional mono wafer capacity will allow us to significantly increase the proportion of self produced high efficiency products and improve overall profitability this year we also launched the latest addition to our premium cheetah products the swan bifacial module with a new dupont clear dupont tedlar based backsheet this module uses lightweight materials which alleviate a number of problems during the installation process and lower cost per kilowatt hour of electricity produced for our customers we believe that demand for bifacial transparent backsheet products will grow rapidly as they become more mainstream going forward i am pleased with the progress we made during the quarter in reinforcing our competitive strengths and favorably positioning ourselves for the future we will continue to expand our market share in china and overseas ramp up production of high efficiency mono products and leverage our strong brand recognition and reputation for quality to meet global demand first quarter 2019 financial results total

by reuters by lucia mutikani washington reuters u s consumer spending increased moderately in may and prices rose slightly pointing to slowing economic growth and benign inflation pressures which could give the federal reserve ammunition to cut interest rates next month the report from the commerce department on friday came just a week after the fed signalled it could ease monetary policy as early as july citing low inflation as well as growing risks to the economy from an escalation in trade tensions between the united states and china inflation has undershot the u s central bank s 2 percent target this year below target inflation is a concern for the fed but not the primary reason they are leaning towards cutting interest rates said ryan sweet a senior economist at moody s analytics in west chester pennsylvania the fed has an easing bias because of growth concerns and low inflation has only helped lower the bar for even further rate cuts consumer spending which accounts for more than two thirds of u s economic activity rose 0 4 as households boosted purchases of motor vehicles and spent more at restaurants and on hotel accommodation data for april was revised up to show consumer spending advancing 0 6 instead of the previously reported 0 3 percent gain last month s increase in spending was in line with economists expectations consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures pce price index rose 0 2 last month as a 0 3 rebound in food prices was tempered by a 0 6 decline in the cost of gasoline and other energy goods the pce price index increased 0 3 in april in the 12 months through may the pce price index increased 1 5 slowing from april s 1 6 advance excluding the volatile food and energy components the pce price index climbed 0 2 last month after a similar gain in april that kept the annual increase in the so called core pce price index at 1 6 for a second straight month in may the core pce index is the fed s preferred inflation measure it hit the central bank s 2 target in march 2018 for the first time since april 2012 the fed last week downgraded its inflation projection for 2019 to 1 5 from the 1 8 projected in march fed chairman jerome powell at his press conference did not refer to weak inflation as transient the low inflation projections were supported by a survey on friday from the university of michigan showing consumers this month expected slower price increases over the next 12 months compared to may consumers inflation expectations over a five year period fell to 2 3 from 2 6 last month the dollar dipped against a basket of currencies u s treasury yields rose slightly as investors awaited crucial trade talks on saturday between washington and beijing stocks on wall street were trading marginally higher less momentum when adjusted for inflation consumer spending rose 0 2 in may this so called real consumer spending increased by the same margin in april the moderate increase in real spending in the last two months suggested consumer spending was struggling to accelerate after slowing sharply in the first quarter it still looks like spending has firmed noticeably relative to the weak run around the turn of the year but we now see less recent momentum than we had been expecting said daniel silver an economist at jp morgan in new york consumer spending increased at a 0 9 annualised rate in the january march quarter the slowest in a year the overall economy grew at a 3 1 rate last quarter boosted by exports an accumulation of inventory and government spending on highways and defence the tepid real consumer spending gain added to weak may reports on manufacturing trade job growth and the housing market in suggesting a deceleration in economic activity advertisement the manufacturing sector s deepening troubles were underscored by a third report on friday showing a measure of factory activity in the midwest tumbled into contraction territory this month for the first time since january 2017 the mni chicago business barometer decreased by 4 5 points to a reading of 49 7 in june a reading below 50 indicates contraction in the region s manufacturing it added to other weak regional manufacturing surveys including from the new york fed richmond fed and philadelphia fed the evidence that renewed uncertainties about trade and tariff policies and the impact on global supply chains and capital spending is adversely affecting manufacturing activity continues to build with this report said john ryding chief economist at rdq economics in new york the economy is shifting into lower gear as last year s stimulus from massive tax cuts and increased government spending fades following the consumer spending data the atlanta fed slashed its second quarter gross domestic product forecast by four tenths of a percentage point to a 1 5 rate last month spending on goods increased 0 5 with outlays on long lasting manufactured goods such as motor vehicles surging 1 7 spending on services gained 0 4 advertisement consumer spending in may was supported by a 0 5 rise in personal income which matched april s increase wages gained 0 2 after increasing 0 3 in april savings rose to 985 4 billion in may from 975 0 billion in the prior month decent income gains are supporting continued consumer spending but weakness in wage increases remains a threat to growth said joel naroff chief economist at naroff economic advisors in holland pennsylvania reporting by lucia mutikani editing by paul simao

key overseas markets module shipments during the first quarter were 3 037 megawatts an increase of 50 7 year over year and a decrease of 16 1 sequentially our gross margin was 16 6 up from 14 7 sequentially and 14 4 year over year as we increasingly benefit from a higher proportion of sales being generated by our self produced high efficiency mono products and further reductions in production cost we continue to see strong demand from overseas markets and have secured the vast majority of our order book for the rest of the year the global solar market continues to generate rapid and sustainable growth momentum as grid parity approaches in particular for our high efficiency mono products which are continuously in short supply our global distribution network allowed us to quickly meet growing demand for our high efficiency mono products over the past few quarters as the market transitioned we are accelerating the expansion of our high efficiency mono production capacity and estimate they will account for over 60 of our total shipments for the year on the domestic front policies recently laid out by china s national energy administration are expected to create a strong demand during the second half of the year china is expected to install 40 gw this year european markets continue to perform very well following the cancellation of the minimum import price policy resulting in a surge in demand from price sensitive projects we expect european installations to hit 17 gw this year in the u s recent policy changes exempting bifacial solar modules from section 201 tariffs are expected to further accelerate medium and long term demand and significantly increase the application of bifacial modules the u s is expected to install 12 gw to 15 gw this year we successfully raised us 160 million last month in a follow on offering of adss and concurrent private placement of convertible senior notes which is being deployed to expand our mono wafer and perc cell capacities our new 5 gw mono wafer production facility in leshan sichuan province began trial production this month and will ramp up to full capacity by the fourth quarter of this year this new production facility will serve as a benchmark for the industry with its cutting edge technology and industry leading cost structure the additional mono wafer capacity will allow us to significantly increase the proportion of self produced high efficiency products and improve overall profitability this year we also launched the latest addition to our premium cheetah products the swan bifacial module with a new dupont clear dupont tedlar based backsheet this module uses lightweight materials which alleviate a number of problems during the installation process and lower cost per kilowatt hour of electricity produced for our customers we believe that demand for bifacial transparent backsheet products will grow rapidly as they become more mainstream going forward i am pleased with the progress we made during the quarter in reinforcing our competitive strengths and favorably positioning ourselves for the future we will continue to expand our market share in china and overseas ramp up production of high efficiency mono products and leverage our strong brand recognition and reputation for quality to meet global demand first quarter 2019 financial results total

usd jpy has risen from the lows amid optimism about trade and moderate comments from the fed the trump xi summit and the non farm payrolls promise an intriguing start to the second half of 2019 early july s daily chart indicates further falls for the currency pair experts see sideways movement in the short term and rises afterward what just happened fed moderates trade in focus the federal reserve has taken a step back from its dovish message suggesting an interest rate cut in july may only serve as an insurance policy and not the beginning of a series of rate reductions james bullard president of the saint louis branch of the federal reserve discarded the option of a 50 basis point cut that markets had hoped for fed chair jerome powell did not refer directly to rates but highlighted the strengths in the economy overall the central bank has moderated expectations for looser monetary policy and pushed the dollar higher us data has been mixed durable goods orders dropped by 1 3 worse than had been anticipated but the non defense ex aircraft component surprised with an increase of 0 4 the final read of gdp has shown that the us economy grew by 3 1 annualized in the first quarter of the year as expected on the one hand consumer expenditure was downgraded on the other hand underlying inflation was surprisingly revised to the upside trade has been in the spotlight ahead of the all important summit between president donald trump and his chinese counterpart xi jinping markets were cheered by reports that both sides agreed to a trade truce no new tariffs during a fresh round of negotiations however trump threatened to slap more duties and china would like to remove all the levies imposed by the us in the past year at the time of writing uncertainty remains high in japan the bank of japan s meeting minutes document has shown concern about low inflation and readiness to add more monetary stimulus however the boj seems to be short of additional policy measures as japanese bond yields are already at rock bottom levels and the interest rate is negative at 0 10 the yen temporarily gained ground amid tensions in the middle east iran downed a us drone and trump was close to authorizing an airstrike in retaliation the incident intensified tensions and also pushed oil prices higher us events trump xi summit full nfp buildup trump and xi will meet for a crucial summit early on saturday while markets are closed and the results will echo throughout the week current expectations are modest an agreement to resume official trade talks and refrain from imposing new tariffs would please markets and may push usd jpy higher if the leaders of the world s largest economies strike a deal a highly unlikely scenario stocks may roar and dollar yen could jump higher as well however a more likely scenario would be an inconclusive summit that will later lead to the us announcing new duties on china in this adverse scenario which has a medium probability usd jpy may not only retreat back to previous levels but plunge to new lows the economic calendar is packed with events that will initially compete for attention with the summit june s ism manufacturing pmi kicks off the week with an expected slide from 52 1 points recorded in june the forward looking indicator provides an insight into the manufacturing sector and its response to trade tensions and also serves as

lawrence lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer thank you kasey good morning everyone thanks for joining us our solid second quarter results were in line with our expectations and as we enter the second and most significant half of our year we are confident in our growth trajectory and that we are well positioned to deliver strong results in 2019 our successful execution of our strategies and engagement of employees around the world have driven sales operating profit and adjusted eps growth as well as operating margin expansion in both the second quarter and year to date starting on slide 4 our broad and advantaged global flavor portfolio continues to position us to meet the demand for flavor around the world to grow our business among our second quarter highlights across our portfolio we drove growth in our consumer segment base business and through new products in all regions including zatarain s meal solutions and frozen entrées and u k rapid recipe mixes in the americas frank s redhot sauce continues its strong performance and we are also gaining momentum with frank s internationally in our flavor solutions segment our americas and emea regions drove significant growth in flavors branded foodservice and condiments with strong contributions from both new products and the base business we are confident our breadth and reach will continue to differentiate mccormick and will be the foundation of our sales growth as consumers demand for flavor continues to rise now let me go to more detail on our second quarter performance as seen on slide 5 as well as provide some business comments before turning it over to mike who will go more in depth on the quarter end results and discuss our 2019 financial guidance starting with our top line for the second quarter second quarter sales were comparable to the year ago period including a 3 unfavorable impact from currency in constant currency sales grew 3 for the total company with both segments growing sales in each of our three regions this growth was attributable to higher volume and product mix as well as pricing and was entirely organic driven by the base business and new products as we had no acquisition impact in the quarter in our consumer segment sales declined 1 including a 3 unfavorable impact from currency in constant currency sales grew 2 in our flavor solutions segment sales grew 1 and in constant currency grew 4 in addition to our top line growth we grew adjusted operating income and expanded our adjusted operating margin with our higher sales and cost savings led by our comprehensive continuous improvement program cci we grew the second quarter s adjusted operating income 5 or 8 in constant currency and expanded our adjusted operating margin 80 basis points at the bottom line our second quarter adjusted earnings per share of 1 16 was 14 higher than 1 02 in the second quarter of 2018 driven primarily by our adjusted operating income growth and the lower adjusted tax rate and this 14 adjusted earnings per share growth includes an unfavorable impact from currency our second quarter results were solid and we continue to expect another year of strong performance in 2019 we re reaffirming our sales outlook and as mike will explain in detail we are updating our operating profit outlook and increasing our earnings per share outlook i d like to turn now to some business updates with a focus this morning on highlights from our consumer and flavor solutions segments and update on our business transformation activity and our business momentum that reinforces our confidence in the remainder of the year turning on slide 6 with our consumer segment as i just mentioned we grew constant currency sales 2 with increases in each of our three regions in the americas we grew constant currency sales 2 driven by higher volume and product mix a late easter which delayed the start of grilling season tempered sales growth for the quarter we estimate our consumption growth for the quarter including both measured and unmeasured channels was 2 our iri data indicates u s spice and seasoning scanner sales for multi outlets grew 2 for the category and 1 for mccormick branded while the late grilling start slowed the category growth it had a greater impact on our consumption we again had strong growth in unmeasured channels including club e commerce and hispanic retail chains our category management initiatives effective marketing support merchandising execution expanded distribution and new products contributed to drive consumption growth across our americas consumer portfolio mccormick branded dry recipe mixes and stubb s barbecue continued their momentum of consumption and share growth zatarain s frozen items both base business and new products drove growth frank s redhot sauce continued strong performance with distribution gains with total distribution points hitting a record high and with our category management initiatives and focused marketing support french s mustard grew consumption and share we believe these actions will continue to drive consumption and sales growth in the second half of the year now turning to europe middle east and africa the emea region constant currency growth was driven by very strong promotional programs and targeted brand marketing across the region expanded distribution and new products were also growth drivers we had broad based growth across most of the region including strength in eastern europe we re excited by our continued momentum on new product launches and the successes we ve realized to date with more flavors and varieties to come as well as further distribution expansion in the asia pacific region we built further momentum of frank s and french s particularly in china india and australia the foundation we continue to establish while still early days is driving results although growth in the region has been partially impacted by recent macroeconomic pressures in china our fundamentals across the region remain strong turning now to slide 7 in our flavor solutions segment our sales performance was strong our constant currency sales growth was 4 driven by higher volume and product mix on base business as well as new products we re continuing to win with our customers through new products expanded distribution and promotional activities in the americas we drove constant currency sales growth of 3 we had strong sales growth to quick service restaurants as well as in our flavor product category our flavor sales were driven by snack seasonings partially due to new products and our customers promotions and by products that deliver the clean label and better for you attributes our customers are seeking we also had strong branded foodservice growth driven by increased distribution with national and regional customers promotional activity with operators and expansion in emerging channels in branded foodservice we continue to realize the benefit of leveraging our full portfolio of mccormick spices and seasonings and frank s french s and cattlemen s products across operators our strong momentum in emea was once again reflected in our second quarter results sales growth was outstanding 9 in constant currency and was broad based across the portfolio both from a product category and customer perspective we drove sales growth to quick service restaurants partially due to their strong promotional activity and to packaged food companies with new products being a key driver turning now to slide 8 as we previously discussed most recently at cagny we are making investments to build the mccormick of the future including in our global enablement organization to transform mccormick through globally aligned innovative services enabling the business to grow as technology provides the backbone for this greater process alignment information sharing and scalability we re also making investments in our information systems we have progressed our erp replacement program and accelerated the transformation of our ways of working this will enable us to realize the benefits of a scalable platform for growth sooner we have estimated the total cost of our erp investment to range between 150 million and 200 million from 2019 through the anticipated completion of our global rollout in fiscal 2021 the capital spend portion is estimated to be 90 million to 120 million and program expenses 60 million to 80 million mike will discuss this further in his remarks next as we are at the midpoint of the year i d like to share a few comments about the momentum we are carrying into the balance of the year our largest quarters are ahead of us and as we have remarked previously our operating profit growth is weighted toward the second half of our year as seen on slide 9 our confidence for the second half has bolstered first by our plans for a strong americas fall and holiday season partially driven by a significant increase in brand marketing we continue to optimize our brand marketing spend both in terms of working and nonworking mix as well as in timing increasing our effectiveness and getting more value out of each marketing dollar we have intentionally skewed our brand marketing spend to be heavier later in the year to maximize our roi and support the key holiday period additionally we have robust brand marketing investments planned in support of the significant array of new products we ve launched across all regions during our first half and are now gaining momentum in distribution and we have exciting additional new product launches in our second half this new product lineup includes in the u s street tacos following the successful u k street food launch complete meal seasonings a package of complementary seasonings for our consumers protein vegetables and starch and thai kitchen coconut milk in a resealable tetra package in emea in addition to flavor and geographic extensions we ll be launching premium grinders and in china we re launching a full range of thick texture salad dressings and light meal sauces our confidence is also driven by new distribution we ve successfully secured realizing the benefits of distribution gained throughout the first half of the year across both our consumer and flavor solutions segments and in flavor solutions we expect continued momentum and wins with our customers through new products and promotional activities finally as we ve mentioned previously we will be lapping several onetime items which impacted us unfavorably in late 2018 such as the unusual fourth quarter impacts we had in the americas consumer business and our move to a new global headquarters we re excited about our plans and confident in delivering strong sales growth in our second half as well as significant profit realization while continuing to invest in the business now i d like to provide a few summary comments as seen on slide 10 before turning it over to mike at the foundation of our sales growth is the rising consumer demand for flavor we are aligned with the consumers increased interest in bolder flavors demand for convenience and focus on fresh natural ingredients as well as with emerging purchase drivers such as greater transparency around the sourcing and quality of food with this increased interest flavor continues to be an advantaged global category which combined with our execution against effective strategies will drive strong results we have a solid foundation and in an environment that continues to be dynamic and fast paced we are ensuring we remain agile relevant and focused on sustainable growth our experienced leaders and employees are executing against our strategies which are designed to build long term value for our shareholders our second quarter financial results across both our consumer and flavor solutions segments contributed to a great first half of the fiscal year our fundamentals are strong and we re confident the initiatives we have under way position us to continue our growth trajectory we re balancing our resources and efforts to drive sales with a work to lower costs to build fuel for growth and higher margin while making the investments in our future we have confidence in our updated fiscal year outlook and we are well positioned to deliver another strong year in 2019 we remain excited as we enter our second half and continue to drive results around the world mccormick employees are driving our momentum and success and i thank them for their efforts and engagement thank you for your attention and it is now my pleasure to turn it over to mike for additional remarks on our second quarter financial results and our updated 2019 outlook mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks lawrence and good morning everyone as lawrence indicated we delivered solid second quarter results in line with our expectations i ll begin with a discussion of our results and then follow with details of our full year 2019 financial outlook turning on slide 12 we grew sales 3 in constant currency and as lawrence mentioned earlier this was entirely organic growth driven by the base business and new products as we had no acquisition impact in the quarter both our consumer and flavor solutions segments delivered top line constant currency growth in each of our three regions the consumer segment grew sales 2 in constant currency this growth was driven by all three regions and was attributable to expanded distribution new products and pricing on slide 13 consumer segment sales in the americas rose 2 in constant currency versus the second quarter of 2018 this increase was driven by higher volume and product mix including zatarain s products frank s redhot sauces branded extracts and our branded hispanic products partially tempered by the delayed grilling season start in emea constant currency consumer sales were up 1 from a year ago higher volume and product mix were driven by new products distribution gains and promotional activities this growth was partially offset by a decline in private label as well as pricing actions including those related to planned trade promotional activity for new products we grew consumer sales in the asia pacific region 3 with growth in india and australia driven by our marketing programs as well as expanded distribution additionally china pricing actions were partially offset by related volume impacts as well as the macroeconomic pressures lawrence mentioned earlier turning to our flavors solutions segment on slide 16 we grew second quarter constant currency sales 4 with growth in all three regions led by strength in emea in the americas flavor solutions constant currency sales increased 3 with broad based growth across the portfolio excluding a decline in bulk ingredients new products expanded distribution and our customer promotional activities all contributed to the sales increase in emea we grew flavor solutions sales 9 in constant currency across both packaged food companies and quick service restaurants partially due to their promotional activity this growth was driven by new products pricing and base business volume growth and spanned all categories in the asia pacific region flavor solutions sales in constant currency grew 2 versus the year ago period as higher sales to quick service restaurants were partially driven by the timing of the promotional activities across both segments adjusted operating income which excludes special charges and for 2018 the transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition of our frank s and french s brands rose 5 in the second quarter versus the year ago period and excluding the impact of unfavorable currency rose 8 adjusted operating income in the consumer segment rose to 138 million a 7 increase adjusted operating income in the flavor solutions segment rose to 77 million a 2 increase in constant currency adjusted operating income increased 9 in consumer segment and 5 in the flavor solutions segment in both segments the increase was primarily driven by cci led cost savings higher sales and lower brand marketing expenses the impact of these drivers in the flavor solutions segment was partially offset by an unfavorable transactional impact of foreign currency exchange rates as well as unfavorable mix related to a sales shift in quick service restaurants from limited time offers to core menu items as seen on slide 21 in the second quarter we increased gross profit margin 30 basis points year on year driven by cci led cost savings our selling general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales decreased by 50 basis points from the second quarter of 2018 this decrease was primarily driven by lower brand marketing investments which as lawrence mentioned earlier is partially driven by timing and through our new marketing excellence organization we are increasing our efficiency and speed as well as realizing brand marketing cci through the creation of in house services and consolidated media buys as a reminder while our first half brand marketing is lower than last year we are planning to spend brand marketing comparable to 2018 partially by reinvesting our continued marketing excellence cost savings and nonworking media spend reductions into working media therefore we are planning brand marketing increases in our second half sg a leverage gained from cci led cost savings initiatives and onetime global benefit plan alignment was offset by business transformation expenses driven by our erp platform replacement in fiscal year 2019 we expect the erp expenses to be concentrated in our second and third quarters the combination of the gross margin expansion and the overall sg a leverage resulted in an adjusted operating margin expansion of 80 basis points for the second quarter of 2019 turning to income taxes on slide 22 our second quarter adjusted effective income tax rate was 18 9 as compared to 22 2 in the year ago period our second quarter adjusted rate was favorably impacted by discrete tax items principally due to stock option exercises as we have discussed in previous quarters favorable tax rate impacts of option exercises are partially offset by payroll and social related taxes which unfavorably impact operating profit considering the year to date favorable impact from discrete items we now expect our full year 2019 adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 21 there can be volatility in that rate quarter to quarter due to the unpredictability of discrete items changes to our forecasted mix of earnings and interpretation of regulations continuing to be released clarifying the impacts of the 2017 u s tax act income from unconsolidated operations was 10 million compared to 7 million in the second quarter of 2018 a 28 increase driven by excellent performance by our mccormick de mexico joint venture for 2019 we now expect a high single digit increase in our income from unconsolidated operations at the bottom line as shown on slide 24 second quarter 2019 adjusted earnings per share was 1 16 up 14 from 1 02 for the year ago period primarily due to growth in our operating performance including from our joint ventures and a lower adjusted income tax rate and this increase included an unfavorable impact from currency the company continues to generate strong cash flow on slide 25 we ve summarized highlights for cash flow and the quarter end balance sheet our cash flow provided from operations was 314 million through the second quarter of 2019 compared to 235 million from the first half of 2018 our strong operating cash flow was driven by higher operating income and our continued working capital initiatives as we execute against programs to achieve working capital reductions including inventory management programs we continue to see improvements in our cash conversion cycle finishing the second quarter down six days versus our fiscal year end a portion of this cash was used to pay down 88 million of acquisition debt as the company continues to focus on paying down debt as we have maintained our disciplined acquisition strategy with a focus on paying down debt we finished the second quarter with a debt to adjusted ebitda ratio below four times which is pacing us ahead of our target of three times by the end of 2020 so as lawrence mentioned during the first quarter earnings call while our priority is paying down debt it is also time for us to start exploring acquisition opportunities which represent a key part of our long term growth strategy for the first half of fiscal 2019 we returned 151 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and used 54 million for capital expenditures this period we expect 2019 to be another year of strong cash flow driven by profit and working capital initiatives and our priority is to continue to have a balanced use of cash making investments to drive growth returning a significant portion to our shareholders through dividends and to pay down debt let s now move to our current financial outlook for 2019 on slide 26 we continue to expect another year of strong performance in 2019 with our broad and advantaged flavor portfolio effective growth strategies and focus on profit realization we are reaffirming our sales outlook and updating our operating profit and earnings per share outlook we continue to estimate based on prevailing rates a two percentage point unfavorable impact from currency rates on net sales adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share we also continue to expect the unfavorable currency will be greater in the first half of the year than in the second half at the top line we reaffirm our guidance to grow sales 1 to 3 which in constant currency is a 3 to 5 projected growth rate as a reminder this will be entirely organic growth driven primarily by higher volume and product mix as well as the impact of pricing to offset an anticipated low single digit cost increase we continue to project our 2019 gross profit margin to be 25 to 75 basis points higher than in 2018 in part driven by our cci led cost savings we re now expecting our adjusted operating income growth to be 6 to 8 from 930 million in 2018 which in constant currency is an 8 to 10 projected growth rate remaining above our long term objective and reflects our continued focus on profit realization our cost savings target remains approximately 110 million and we expect brand marketing to be comparable to 2018 our updated adjusted operating income growth rate continues to reflect expected strong performance the decrease from the outlook last year during our march earnings call reflects the impacts of a classification shift in our erp spending the operating expense headwind related to option exercises which partially offset the tax benefit and global developments including trade and economic conditions in selected countries as lawrence mentioned we are progressing our erp replacement program and while our estimated total 2019 project investment related to this business transformation has remained unchanged we now expect a lower 2019 capital spend component and higher operating expenses than we had originally expected for 2019 resulting from this classification shift we are lowering our 2019 capital spend outlook to approximately 200 million and our 2019 updated operating profit outlook reflects the increased expense we are excited about this investment to enable us to transform our ways of working and realize the benefits of a scalable growth platform we are increasing our guidance for 2019 adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of 5 20 to 5 30 which compares to 4 97 of adjusted earnings per share in 2018 and represents a 5 to 7 increase or in constant currency 7 to 9 this increase reflects the impact of changes i previously mentioned our updated adjusted operating income outlook the expected increase in income from unconsolidated operations and the projected lower adjusted effective tax rate in summary we continue to project strong growth in our 2019 constant currency outlook for sales adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share following record double digit performance across each objective in 2018 and while continuing to invest for future growth i d like to now turn it back to lawrence for some additional remarks before we move to your questions lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer thank you mike now that mike has shared our financial results and outlook in more detail i d like to recap the key takeaways as seen on slide 27 we re delivering against our plans both for sales and profit realization and are confident in the momentum of our business with our year to date results we have a strong start to the year moving into our second half we re confident in our plans including brand marketing support new product launches and new distribution which will drive further growth our 2019 outlook continues to reflect strong operating performance and finally we are sustainably positioned for growth and are continuing to deliver differentiated results while also investing to build the mccormick of the future now let s turn to your questions questions answers operator our first question comes from the line of andrew lazar with barclays andrew lazar barclays analyst hi good morning everybody lawrence i know that last quarter was one of the first in probably a couple of years where mccormick actually gained share in the core spices and seasonings business in the u s and i know that s something that obviously you ve been narrowing the gap quite a bit with the category and then flipped to gaining some share i think your comment in 2q was that the delayed the easter delay around grilling season i think you worded it it hit mccormick or affected mccormick at a greater rate than let s say the category and so it looked like there was a little bit of a share loss i m just trying to get a sense of why that dynamic would ve played out for mccormick differently than let s say the category and if there s any change in sort of the cadence of continuing to feel better about share gains going forward lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer right sure andrew well first of all it s not easter it s the grilling season that was the issue easter fell later in the calendar we actually had a great easter season but the late easter did compress the grilling season and that compression of the grilling season impacted our grilling products and seasonally our grilling season items particularly our grill mates seasoning blends are a big part of our business at this time of year we didn t mention it in our prepared remarks but it was also an exceptionally wet season so the quarter was i think the fifth wettest on record and may was the second wettest on record and just the combination of the slow the late grilling season that compression of the grilling season and some unfavorable weather was a headwind to our grill mates range so that caused us to pace behind the category i think the whole category was somewhat depressed by the compression of that grilling season we re not the only ones to have a grilling range so but we re the market leader in the grill mates range it s a big part of our business at this time of the year so category was only up about 2 we were only up about 1 in terms of spices and seasonings for the quarter and we lost about 30 basis points of share although we re getting into a stronger position from a share gain standpoint there are going to be some moving parts i d say that 30 basis points is not something that we are concerned about that we ve had a good strong underlying trend and i also want to point out that the unmeasured channels are not captured in that and we continue to have very strong growth in the unmeasured channel area that does not come through that consumption data i ll also point out that private label also lost share so while there had been a lot of concerns about private label in the market private label is becoming less and less of a factor so that s not that came in operator our next question comes from the line of david driscoll with citi research david driscoll citi research analyst thank you and good morning two questions for me just on the operating profit guide down can you just talk about the environment outside the united states and the impact to your operating profit guidance and then just a longer term question lawrence wanted to get your sense as to the in home cooking trends i just i think they are quite positive right now but wanted to get your sense as to as the u s unemployment rate remains very very low how do you see those in home trends continuing over the course of kind of medium term do you think that the low unemployment will drive the people out to the restaurants or do you really see in home cooking as a sustainable driver even with this very very low unemployment rate lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer i m going to let mike take the front end of that mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i ll talk about the change in operating profit guidance was really driven primarily by the shift from capital to expense in the erp side of things in the global economic environment as you mentioned was a small piece of that but i would just characterize things as volatile right now we ve talked about how we ve had mitigation plans for brexit and emea that s on again off again it s been longer than we would have thought at this point we had the mexico scare about a month ago we have significant business down there and we have the china slowdown china had the slowest growth from a gdp perspective in 20 years in their first quarter so it s really volatile now and we kind of consider that for our ongoing operating profit guidance for this year but the real change versus our previous guidance is due to just a classification shift on erp lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer and as far as eating out trends this is a long term trend unemployment has been very low for quite a long time i think that this cooking at home trend is more a characteristic of the millennial generation and is not being driven by economic factors it s being more driven by a desire for more fresh food and a different kind of lifestyle and so i think that the unemployment rate i think that that trend continues intact in the short medium and long term operator our next question comes from the line of ken goldman with jp morgan ken goldman j p morgan analyst thanks good morning everybody two questions for me and if you addressed this forgive me i have a couple earnings this morning but number one you re looking for a very big jump in the tax rate in the second half but historically you ve consistently i would i think it s fair to say over guided when it comes to taxes just to be conservative perhaps and which is great but just to be aligned with history why shouldn t we model a little bit of a lower tax rate than what you ve guided to for the second half and then my second question is i wanted to get a sense the economic conditions you mentioned in china was that more on the foodservice side on the retail side i just wanted to get a little bit more color on exactly what the headwind is there mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer it s mike i ll talk about the taxes i mean we talked about this in the past i mean you re right generally we guide to an underlying tax rate based on regulations and things it has gotten a bit volatile the last couple of years when the accounting rules changed around stock option discrete items stock option exercises what we try to do is lay out the underlying and if there s discrete items like that that happen that is a favorable to us and we ve seen that through the first half of the year i mean one of the things with our stock appreciation over the last couple of years there s been significant stock option exercises a lot by retirees and that does also drive some unfavorable from an operating profit perspective and it puts more shares out there too so it isn t all something to drop to the bottom line from a tax perspective but second half if you do the squeeze there s 24 to 25 that is the underlying tax rate and as we know with the gilti tax and other things that are still uncertain from the federal government it could go either way but i d look to the past a bit but we ve had in the last year real significant discrete items from stock options which may or may not continue lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer and that s retiree stock option exercises i ll add some color to that the so on china that s a really good question ken the slowdown there is an economic slowdown in china as we all know we suspect that the official figures are probably optimistic and that maybe the slowdown in china is even greater than would appear from the government statistics that are released i m saying that as nicely as i can and it is the case that we re seeing the biggest impact in the restaurant sector in china our consumer business includes a foodservice component because they share a common distribution channel particularly in the traditional trade and in the smaller markets and that those foodservice related items are where we re seeing some impact and anecdotally we re certainly getting a lot of feedback from our organization in china that foodservice and restaurant sales that are slow over in our flavor solutions side of the business our customers are more focused on core products as a result because they re trying to drive value to the restaurant and bring people in so i think that the economic conditions are having a greater impact on foodservice and restaurant consumption than on the true retail part of the business where our retails related items continue to show very strong growth and our e commerce business which is consumer oriented continues to show really strong growth in that area there is another compounding factor and that is this african swine fever this caused starting to show up as a meat shortage and rising meat prices in china which puts cost pressure on the whole foodservice sector there of course that bleeds over to all the alternative meats as well and with the resulting price impacted the consumer who s going through different foodservice outlets so that s a little bit of a longish answer but it is more foodservice than retail operator our next question comes from the line of alexia howard with bernstein alexia howard sanford c bernstein analyst good morning everyone so two questions the first one on the consumer americas business and the fact that it was i guess negatively affected by the shorter grilling season maybe the wet weather hit things a little hard this time as well does that mean we would expect to go back to a more normal level of sales growth starting next quarter is there anything sort of out there that would say it wouldn t sort of start to get back to a more normal level next time and then a more specific question on the emea flavor solutions business obviously very strong this time around was that largely based on you mentioned the qsr promotions but were there also new contract wins i just wanted to get an idea of whether that strength is likely to be sustainable lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer ok those thanks alexia we did you started your question before we could say hi the consumer americas specifically first of all i don t want to apologize too much for the organic growth that we re having there some of our peers are reporting right around us see quite a differential between what we re reporting and what they are i think that we did have solid organic sales growth and i don t want us to lose the thread of thought on that but we are expecting a stronger second half to the year than the first half and i think that we ve been trying to signal that all year long right from the guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year and even in our remarks at the end of first quarter our marketing spend is deliberately skewed to the second half of the year whereas the strongest roi our new product launches in the first half we get the benefit of that in the second half we have more new products that we re launching in the second half of the year as well we are going to be lapping some americas anomalies in the fourth quarter that we don t expect to repeat so overall we are expecting higher organic sales growth in the americas as we go through the second half if i could shift gears over to the emea flavor solutions business it s both so this is a continuation of the strong trend that we saw in the first quarter in that business in terms of the constant currency growth it s actually exactly the same as it was in the first quarter and it s driven by the same factors we have we do have some new customer wins but we also have strong growth with our existing customer base there operator our next question comes from the line of robert moskow with credit suisse robert moskow credit suisse analyst so the guidance for the year has always involved or required a lot of operating leverage a little bit less now with the operating income down 1 can you talk a little bit more detail about the transformation spending that you re doing the erp and how can you give us some specific details on how that can release more cost savings going forward you mentioned some efficiencies but are there any headcount implications heading into the next two years from what you re doing with erp mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer this is mike i mean this is a three year initiative and we re in year one of the three years and we laid out the capital and the expense portions of that that we ll realize over the three years we did talk about the shift and it s really primarily a lot of our expenses happening in the second and third quarter of this year that will shift to more of the capital side of things but really we re focusing on this business transformation of erp as really a growth initiative and it will give us efficiencies no question as we standardize processes around the world as we do things one way around the world it s really to make sure we can focus our resources on growing the business bringing in acquisitions much easier we in the past as we brought in acquisitions it s been tough and it takes a lot of effort from the organization so i think that s something i d focus from a growth perspective as we continue to get more and more scale to be a bigger company this is really an investment in our business to get us to the next level lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer i ll add to that a little bit rob and that is that this is linked also to our global enablement program where we re simplifying our processes aligning them globally so we can centralize them and that definitely both enables us to be more agile and grow and it also does absolutely result in cost savings because we get we do get a benefit from that scale so this is a technology enabling part of that global enablement project as part of this we are also as a technology upgrade we are making the migration to the next generation of sap s 4hana the whole industry is going to have to go to that most some of us have but most of us have not yet started that journey it is if you are doing it on a pretty brisk pace as we are minimum of a 3 year project sap goes out of service in 2025 we want to be well ahead of that curve and we see this as an opportunity rather than as a cost that we have to bear down the road robert moskow credit suisse analyst ok a quick follow up though i thought i heard you say that you re in a better position to make acquisitions now can you did i hear that correctly and if so what capabilities are you focused on acquiring mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer as we move down toward the three times debt to ebitda i think that was what we were saying as we get closer to our commitment that allows us to start looking at acquisitions lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer exactly we re not and the kind of acquisitions that we would look for will be consistent with what we ve done and messaged in the past great flavor businesses great consumer brands that build our consumer flavor business flavor solutions businesses that add flavor capability and capacity and those will be the main areas mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer and businesses that grow lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer and of course businesses mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer we obviously don t do without growth robert moskow credit suisse analyst got it so three times is really the trigger mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer no lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer you can say that s a trigger but we ve said we ve always committed to that is that we re going to get to three times by the end of 2020 and as we get as we re closing in on that we re not going to start working on deals once we get to three right now we ve got a debt to ebitda ratio that starts with three and we re on track to end up with mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer yes the back end of the year rob is all heavy cash flow by the end of the year we will be in sight robert moskow credit suisse analyst yes yes i thought ok thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of adam samuelson with goldman sachs adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst yes thanks good morning everyone so a question on the flavor solutions business and really centered on the margin side can you quantify the transactional fx headwind that you re facing there i m just and the spirit of the question is the first half organic growth from the business is a little bit north of 5 and margin on a year on year basis are up 10 20 basis points and i m just trying to think about the operating leverage within that mix doesn t seem like it s a headwind especially when you talk about the bulk ingredients business being down so i m just trying to make sure i m understanding kind of some of the costs or margin pressures that are hitting you there and how to think about that going forward mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer so i think you can think about it in a couple of factors that are actually hitting us in the flavor solutions side the transactional fx as you said which has been hitting us the last six months of last year and the first six months of this year we ll get into a more favorable fx comparison in the second 6 so that should be an acceleration there we re also as lawrence mentioned in asia particularly in china as we kind of have a negative mix issue right now as the qsrs are focused more on their core products versus the ltos or limited time offers we make more margin obviously on limited time offers so but we see that again that ebbs and flows and as the economies recover we think we ll go back to more ltos and we re actually seeing a little bit of that in some of the areas so i see an acceleration of our operating margin on the flavor solutions side in the second half as those clouds go away lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer yes particularly that fx is going to be less unfavorable in the second half now we ll i ll temper both of our remarks with the caveat that this has really been a volatile environment and we re but the fx outlook that we have right now we should be getting into comparisons that are pretty close year on year adam samuelson goldman sachs analyst ok and then just quickly on the jv you took up the range for earnings growth in that line item is that just a reflection of the first half performance where you re above the high end of the kind of upper single digit growth or is the full year is the back half actually improving there too lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer yes if i can jump in on that so we re having really strong sales growth in our mix jv and that s falling through to profitability so the performance year to date there has been really good we have positive outcomes and so originally our outlook on our jvs as a group was flat we re in this pretty strong place right now and so we have a it s a little bit of both we have great results here to date and we expect that to continue and i also wanted to really call this out because we don t talk about the unconsolidated operations but those are real operating results we are not passive operators of our unconsolidated jvs and just in the last few weeks both mike and i have been down there multiple times these are businesses that we re actively engaged in mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer and doing very well lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer and doing very well operator our next question comes from the line of chris growe with stifel chris growe stifel financial corp analyst all right i just had two questions if i could i want to follow up on an earlier discussion of obviously a bit of a delay in the grilling season i guess i wanted to be clear is that something if you get back you get those sales back say starting in q3 that this sort of pent up demand by consumers that got pushed out of it is that the way to look at it or is it more of potential for loss sales given promotional changes there lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer no i think that if i could i know you said you had two parts i m going to just jump in and answer i think the consumption that didn t happen didn t happen it was that compression is also something that we ve had discussions about with our customers as well so and so there was lost merchandising activity the customers couldn t get their easter promotions down fast enough to get the grilling promotion display materials up and what the consumers didn t consume because remember we talked about through the scanner that the grill mates the grilling part of our seasoning business is the part that was slow and that s consumption that is that s really lost mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer but it s something we planned internally everyone knows when easter was going to hit we move some advertising into the third quarter you re going to see a nice up spend in the third quarter which hopefully will continue to drive good consumption chris growe stifel financial corp analyst ok great and then in relation to the gross margin how would you characterize cost inflation and pricing are those two roughly estimates i know you did mention that cci was the main driver of your gross margin improvement and maybe related to that in terms of the cci savings are they more gross margin focused this year versus sg a or if you have any color there just would be interested in that mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i wouldn t say from a cci perspective we haven t seen a large shift between cost of goods sold cci or sg a cci i think from a pricing perspective and a cost perspective as we said at the beginning of the year this is a relatively benign environment for us low single digit cost inflation and we take up some pricing where we needed to do that this year but it s a relatively benign size so the cci is able to work for us better to drop through to the operating profit margin lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer and we have some ongoing discussions on price on specific items as well that are always in progress operator our next question comes from the line of rob dickerson with deutsche bank rob dickerson deutsche bank analyst just kind of an overview question on guidance in the back half given all the questions that have already been asked so it seems like what you re saying and kind of what i m hearing is there was maybe a little bit extra spend on the erp system upgrade i guess right i guess the shift to mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer it s a shift rob it s going from capital to expense if you noticed we talked about it in the script our capital range was 200 million to 220 million we ve shifted that down to 200 million now for the year so capital is down expense is up think about it that way lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer it s the same money mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer same cash lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer on the fixed notes right mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer right rob dickerson deutsche bank analyst right so and i mean at times i actually am very ignorant i do admit that so could you just explain that simplistically so everybody on the call can understand mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer yes ok that s fine i mean i can talk for hours about the accounting around this but i won t but it s one of the things when we came into the year and as lawrence talked about in the january call we were starting to engage our system integrator to look at the scope of the project the timing and we had an estimate of what the total cost would be over this couple of years and based on what we knew at the time based on the phases of the project and what is capital what is expense from an accounting perspective we took our best crack at it once the system integrator got in and put the plan together we realized that ok there s a little bit more expense upfront than we thought a little less capital based on the work that they re doing on the erp design the implementation all that sort of stuff so that s where what you see here total cost is going to be about the same it s just a shift between the two based on the accounting rules and better in preparing right now rob dickerson deutsche bank analyst ok good answer and then just secondly and simplistically it sounds like what you re saying is in the back half right given i guess sounds like there s been a little margin mix pressure is not a lot but like you said it kind of restaurants relative to kind of base core retail in asia let s ignore the erp piece for a second but then in the back half maybe some of that loose ends we ll see but it s also there s fx reversal not a full reversal but less of a headwind and then it also sounds like maybe that you re coming out of this kind of late wet post easter grilling season that maybe with marketing dollars you can improve velocities and hopefully also improve some margin mix because when i just look at the guide right and you talked about some of the shift in the grilling season in the quarter or what happened in china but quite frankly your top line is actually still pretty strong and you re exactly in line for the most part where you were relative to q1 on a tier stack basis so it is it seems like it s more of a margin expansion expectation in the back half versus a big top line acceleration relative to the first half is that a fair summary mike smith executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i think you got that right robin you remember the fourth quarter some of the challenges we re going to have a really favorable mix in the back half compared to 2018 based on what we saw last year and the other thing someone mentioned cci before cci built during the year so that does help margin also lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer right and rob i m glad you made a point about the sales growth being solid and look take just a step back on the whole overall picture because like last quarter this was really a solid no drama quarter we put together two pretty undramatic solid performances year over year we had solid sales growth in this quarter nearly 3 in constant currency which compares very strongly to our peers through the first half a little over 3 5 on all of sales growth constant currency all of it organic and as we ve signaled all year we expect a stronger second half we ve had good operating profit growth and margin expansion it s actually in line with our algorithm and quarter by quarter we re putting together a strong 2019 we re very confident in our outlook on the second half and i think that so it s a some really good points you raised operator thank you and ladies and gentlemen this concludes our question and answer session i ll turn the floor back to mr kurzius for any final comments lawrence kurzius chairman president and chief executive officer great thank you everyone for your questions and for participating on today s call mccormick is a global leader in flavor and we re differentiated with a

menafn gulf times blinded by a surging stock market and a 50 year low in the unemployment rate few dare to challenge the wisdom of us economic policy instant gratification has compromised the rigour of objective and disciplined analysis big mistake the toxic combination of ill timed fiscal stimulus aggressive imposition of tariffs and unprecedented attacks on the federal reserve demands a far more critical assessment of trumponomics politicians and pundits can always be counted on to spin the policy debate for us president donald trump and his supporters the art of the spin has been taken to a new level apparently it doesn t matter that federal deficits have been enlarged by an estimated 1 5 trillion over the next decade or that government debt will reach a post world war ii record of 92 of gdp by 2029 the tax cuts driving these worrying trends are rationalized as what it takes to make america great again nor are tariffs viewed as taxes on consumers or impediments to global supply chain efficiencies instead they are portrayed as weaponised negotiating levers to force trading partners to change their treatment of the united states and attacks on the fed s independence are seen not as threats to the central bank s dual mandate to maximise employment and ensure price stability but rather as the president s exercise of his prerogative to use the bully pulpit as he and he alone sees fit there are three basic flaws with trump s approach to economic policy first there is the disconnect between intent and impact the political spin maintains that large corporate tax cuts boost us competitiveness but that doesn t mean deficits and debt don t matter notwithstanding the hollow promises of supply side economics revenue neutral fiscal initiatives that shifted the tax burden from one segment of the economy to another would have come much closer to real reform than the reduction of the overall revenue trajectory has moreover the enactment of fiscal stimulus in late 2017 when the unemployment rate was then at a cyclical low of 4 1 headed toward the current 3 6 added froth to markets and the economy when it was least needed and foreclosed the option of additional stimulus should growth falter similarly trump s tariffs fly in the face of one of the 20th century s greatest policy blunders the smoot hawley tariff of 1930 which sparked a 60 plunge in global trade by 1932 with foreign trade currently accounting for 28 of gdp versus 11 in 1929 the us as a debtor country today is far more vulnerable to trade related disruptions than it was as a net creditor back then ignoring the cascading stream of direct and retaliatory taxes on consumers and businesses that stem from a tariff war trump extols the virtues of tariffs as a beautiful thing that is painfully reminiscent of the 1928 republican party platform which couched tariffs as a fundamental and essential principle of the economic life of this nation and essential for the continued prosperity of the country trump ignores the lessons of the 1930s at great peril the same can be said of trump s recent fed bashing the political independence of central banking is widely regarded as the singular breakthrough needed to achieve price stability following the great inflation of the 1970s in the us passage of the so called humphrey hawkins act of 1978 gave then fed chairman paul volcker the political cover to squeeze double digit inflation out of the system through a wrenching monetary tightening had volcker lacked the freedom to act he would have been constrained by elected leaders political calculus precisely what trump is doing in trying to dictate policy to current fed chair jerome powell the second critical flaw in trump s economic policy package is its failure to appreciate the links between budget deficits tariffs and monetary policy as the late martin feldstein long stressed to the extent that budget deficits put downward pressure on already depressed domestic saving larger trade deficits become the means to fill the void with surplus foreign saving denial of these linkages conveniently allows the us to blame china for self inflicted trade deficits but with tariffs likely to divert trade and supply chains from low cost chinese producers to higher cost alternatives us consumers will be hit with the functional equivalent of tax hikes raising the risk of higher inflation the latter possibility though seemingly remote today could have important consequences for us monetary policy provided of course the fed has the political independence to act finally there are always the lags to keep in mind in assessing the impact of policy while low interest rates temper short term pressures on debt service costs as budget deficits rise there is no guarantee that such a trend will persist over the longer term especially with the already elevated federal debt overhang projected to increase by about 14 percentage points of gdp over the next ten years similarly the disruptive effects of tariffs and shifts in monetary policy take about 12 18 months to be fully evident so rather than bask in today s financial market euphoria politicians and investors should be thinking more about the state of the economy in late 2020 a timeframe that happens to coincide with the upcoming presidential election cycle in assessing how current policies are likely to play out there is nothing remarkable about a us president s penchant for political spin what is glaringly different this time is the lack of any pushback from those who know better the national economic council established in the early 1990s as an honest broker in the executive branch to convene and coordinate debate on key policy issues is now basically dysfunctional the nec s current head larry kudlow a long standing advocate of free trade is squirming to defend trump s tariffs and fed bashing the republican party long a champion of trade liberalisation is equally complicit trump s vindictive bluster has steamrolled economic policy deliberations ignoring the lessons of history rejecting the analytics of modern economics and undermining the institutional integrity of the policymaking process policy blunders of epic proportion have become the rule not the exception it won t be nearly as easy to spin the looming consequences project syndicate l stephen s roach a faculty

donald j trump s 2020 election strategy is to connect his potential democratic opponents with socialism trump plans to use this attack on the democrats even if senator bernie sanders who proudly calls himself a democratic socialist doesn t become the presidential nominee sanders has been decisively re elected in vermont senator elizabeth warren is distancing herself from the socialist label she went so far as to tell the new england council i am a capitalist to my bones sanders and warren are not what they claim to be they are both updating roosevelt s new deal and more closely resemble the social democrats that have governed western european democracies for years delivering higher standards of living than that experienced by americans the original doctrine of socialism meant government ownership of the means of production heavy industries railroads banks and the like nobody in national politics today is suggesting such a takeover as one quipster put it how can washington take ownership of the banks when the banks own washington confronting trump on the socialism taboo can open up a great debate about the value of government intervention for the good of the public sanders can effectively argue that people must choose either democratic socialism or the current failing system of corporate socialism that choice is not difficult such an american democratic socialism could provide almost all of the long overdue solutions this country needs full more efficient medicare for all tuition free education living wages stronger unions a tax system that works for the people investments in infrastructure and public works reforms for a massive runaway military budget the end of most corporate welfare government promotion of renewable energies and the end of subsidies for fossil fuels and nuclear power in my presidential campaigns i tried to make corporate socialism also called corporate welfare or crony capitalism a major issue small business is capitalism free to go bankrupt while corporate capitalism free to get bailouts from washington is really a form of corporate socialism this point about a corporate government was documented many years ago in books such as america inc 1971 by morton mintz and jerry cohen now it is even easier to make the case that our political economy is largely controlled by giant corporations and their political toadies today the concentration of power and wealth is staggering just six capitalist men have wealth to equal the wealth of half of the world s population the wall street collapse of 2008 2009 destroyed eight million jobs lost trillions of dollars in pension and mutual funds and pushed millions of families to lose their homes against this backdrop the u s government used trillions of taxpayer dollars to bail out in various ways the greedy financial giants whose reckless speculating caused the collapse in may 2009 the moderate senator from illinois dick durbin said the banks hard to believe when we re facing a banking crisis that many of the banks created are still the most powerful lobby on capitol hill and they frankly own the place is there a single federal government agency or department that can say its most powerful outside influence is not corporate even the labor department and the national labor relations board are under more corporate power than union power who better than trump on an anti socialist fantasy campaign kick can call attention to the reality that big business controls the government and by extension controls the people in september 2000 a business week poll found over 70 percent of people agreeing that big business has too much control over their lives this was before the horrific corporate crimes and scandals of the past two decades maybe that is why support in polls for socialism against capitalism in the u s is at a 60 year high people have long experienced american style socialism for example the publicly owned water and electric utilities public parks and forests the postal service public libraries fdic guarantees of bank deposits now up to 250 000 social security medicare and medicaid etc what the public is not sufficiently alert to is that big business has been profitably taking over control if not outright ownership of these public assets in the new book banking on the people by ellen brown readers can get an idea of the way large banks insurers and the giant shadow banking system money market funds hedge funds mortgage brokers and other unregulated financial intermediaries speculate and shift deep risk and their failures onto uncle sam these corporate predators gouge customers and remarkably show a deep aversion for productive investment as if people matter moreover they just keep developing new ever riskier multi tiered instruments eg derivatives to make money from money through evermore complex abstract secret reckless entangled globally destabilizing networks gambling with other people s money is a relentless wall street tradition the crashes that inevitably emerge end up impoverishing ordinary people who pay the price with their livelihoods will the democrats and other engaged people take trump on if he tries to make socialism the big scare in 2020 control of our political economy is not a conservative liberal or red state blue state issue when confronted with the specifics of the corporate state or corporate socialism people from all political persuasions will recognize the potential perils to our democracy no one wants to lose essential freedoms or to continue to pay the price of this runaway crony capitalism the gigantic corporations have been built with the thralldom of deep debt corporate debt to fund stock buybacks while reporting record profits consumer debt student loan debt and of course government debt caused by drastic corporate and super rich tax cuts many trillions of dollars have been stolen from future generations no wonder a small group of billionaires including george soros eli broad and nick hanauer have just publicly urged a modest tax on the super wealthy as hanauer a history buff and advocate of higher minimum wages says the pitchforks are coming

after sliding to touch a fresh four month low r17 89166 as friday s european session got underway the uk pound south african rand gbp zar exchange rate reversed losses to trade higher as markets await the outcome of the highly anticipated g20 trump xi trade talks to set the tone with sterling last seen trading at r17 99410 up 0 23 sterling slides to fresh lows on no deal brexit jitters there s been little change to the factors driving the uk pound inexorable declines over recent weeks with investor jitters around the potential for a no deal brexit outcome weighing heavily on the british currency having slid over the course of may and outwith a brief period of stabilisation extended the run of depreciation through june the gbp could incur further losses as the clock ticks down to the october 31st brexit deadline and concerns mount that the newly appointed british pm most likely boris johnson according to bookmaker odds could set the uk off on the path towards a no deal scenario as long as a no deal brexit remains a possibility that should keep the pound below the psychological 1 30 mark against the u s dollar wrote fxtm market analyst han tan adding even though the uk leadership transition is set to be completed within the next month sterling is expected to remain exposed to political risks leading up to the oct 31 brexit deadline as the uk continues to pursue its exit from the european union with sterling s losses over recent months amounting to some of the highest in recent years potential upside on the emergence of positive news flow leaves risks distinctly asymmetric it is going to be a bumpy ride gbp looks a bit more cheap but the fact that it is cheap and unloved means there is a risk we see a slightly stronger gbp we could potentially see a stronger reaction if more market friendly news are delivered wrote global chief strategist joseph little of hsbc while boris johnson has tried to downplay the risks around no deal brexit stating the odds are a million to one against markets remain unconvinced given the hard line euro sceptic has consistently vowed to pull the uk out of the eu by the halloween deadline with or without a deal in hand on a positive note no deal averse uk lawmakers have taken steps to erect fresh barriers to the dreaded no deal outcome advertisement friday s data releases also lent support to the gbp with the uk s trade deficit widening by less than anticipated to 30 0b versus the expected 32 0b while final first quarter gross domestic product gdp growth was confirmed at 0 5 although this figure was deemed inflated due to record high levels of brexit related stockpiling and is expected to moderate moving forward providing fresh evidence of the notable impact prolonged brexit uncertainty is having on the british economy the latest office for national statistics data slipped for earlier estimates of 0 5 quarterly growth to print at 0 4 above business investment growth has moderated since q2 2017 next week uk pmis are likely to be in focus with analysts looking for the figures to confirm the expected slow down in uk economic growth which in turn could keep bank of england policymakers hobbled when it comes to uk interest rates rand pares strength ahead of g20 trade talks trump xi exchange to set market tone next week s uk pmis look set to emphasise that second quarter growth is likely to more or less flatline wrote ing economists adding with brexit uncertainty set to ramp up over the summer we think it is unlikely that the bank of england will hike rates this year the south african rand despite incurring marginal losses on friday has enjoyed a firm spell over recent sessions pushing higher against a basket of major peers as developed market central banks continue to turn dovish while signs of easing trade tension between washington and beijing supported risk buying ahead of the eagerly anticipated g20 meeting between presidents trump and xi jinping while the prospect of considerable fed easing has boosted the zar s appeal alongside emerging market peers the eu leaning towards monetary stimuli has also lent support according to treasury partner at peregrine treasury solutions bianca botes data wise despite printing a trade surplus of zar1 74b in may 2019 the release failed to meet consensus zar2 7b although it did recover from a previous print in deficit territory above south african balance of trade moreover the decision by the south african government to bail out ailing state owned electricity provider eskom alongside the decision by ratings agency moody s to leave the sa outlook unchanged at stable has also helped to boost the zar s appeal moody s has been extremely kind to south africa however fundamentally nothing has changed in this country we still suffer from high unemployment and exceptionally low or no economic growth wrote botes moving forward with president trump and xi expected to discuss trade at the g20 the developments over the weekend will likely set the tone for early trade next week while president trump says he expects the saturday talks with his chinese counterpart to be productive neither side have shown a willingness to compromise on trade terms following the breakdown in talks in early may with many analysts citing a return to the negotiating table as the most positive outcome to be expected all eyes are on the g20 meeting in osaka which started overnight so far president trump has struck a more conciliatory tone i e iran but the focus remains on bilateral us china trade talks tomorrow the outcome of which will set the direction for markets in early july wrote ing economists adding our economists note it still looks as if things will get worse before they get better meaning that any possible relief rally in risk assets after the g20 meeting may be short lived from a technical perspective the rand appears on firm ground although some traders have raised concerns over a potential bear trap for those that think this may be a bear trap again and it could be a possibility a daily close above yesterday s open and a move through yesterday s highs will indicate a possible reversal wrote senior standard bank trader oliver alwar in the near term look to the g20 to set the tone for next week s trade with limited potential for developments on the brexit front the sterling s bearish bias is likely to persist as uncertainty ticks higher while the rand side of the cross could be heavily impacted by the outcome of trump xi talks

today the g20 summit gets underway in japan with the subsequent talks set to dominate the news agenda over the course of the next few days the most interesting meetings are scheduled for saturday meaning that on monday the market will open with a gap on both the american and chinese markets the main focus will still be on the us china negotiations interestingly the media leaked information from informed sources that trump and xi jinping had agreed in advance that after the meeting they will announce a truce in the trade war so not to create too much of a negative effect to the markets added to this us treasury secretary steven mnuchin stoked things up further by stating that the agreement is 90 ready of course this does not mean it will be accepted and executed on the one hand the markets understand this and try to avoid making any sharp movements the dollar index stood still at the level of 96 18 on thursday on the other hand the investors are rather tired with the trade war issues and a certain optimism fed by rumours from the media is included in the us indices quotes last session the stock markets closed in different directions dow jones lost 0 04 s p500 grew by 0 38 and nasdaq composite was in green by 0 67 the hang seng which closed yesterday 1 42 higher and the nikkei 225 which added 1 19 probably believe in a positive resolution of the us china situation as for macroeconomic statistics it is interesting to pay attention to the published us initial jobless claims the data showed an increase of 10k to 227k while analysts expected a more modest increase to 220k this affected the eurusd fall with the rate dropping from 1 1372 to 1 1355 within an hour after the data was published however it later kicked up and during the first g20 hours on friday it was going vertically upwards above 1 1390 investors came out of the dollar fearing what decisions will be made at the summit as mentioned by the fxpro analyst team it is also worth opening the economic calendar today to check the actual core pce value for may y y despite the data being released with a month delay it could increase the volatility in pairs with the dollar the fact is that this value still cannot reach or consolidate above the key level of 2 now it is 1 6 with a similar forecast this indicator is monitored by the fed based on it the regulator decides whether to normalize the monetary policy or not since the beginning of the year the underlying inflation rate has slowed influencing powell s decision to suspend a series of interest rate increases if the analysts expectations are not justified and the data turns out to be even worse than the forecasts the triumphant start to the day for the eurusd will get additional support and send the pair up to 1 141 and potentially even higher if we see an increase in value it will help the dollar to stabilise itself for a moment and adjust its course against the euro however any news from the g20 may be stronger crude oil apparently tired of growing and following thursday dropped to 65 46 per barrel losing 1 55 investors are worried about trump s views on keeping energy prices as low as possible at the same time saudi arabia requires the support of the white house to ensure the safety of tankers in the persian gulf
first off offshore investors have chosen to view our market as a relative safe haven not least because our companies tend to pay out more earnings in dividends with the major banks a big part of that story our miners have also been well supported as commodity export earnings have buttressed the economy and helped inure us from the global fallout of higher tariffs iron ore prices have increased more than 70 per cent over the past year as record levels of chinese steel production boosted demand while a brazilian mine dam failure earlier this year reduced supply thanks to these factors foreign ownership of aussie shares jumped 12 per cent over the first three months of the year according to abs numbers released this week now what there are a couple of implications worthy of consideration advertisement for a start if aussie equities haven t been penalised as a result of trade worries the relief rally from any easing in tensions will be less dramatic here than overseas so if you do want to bet on a trade detente then chinese stocks are the way to go reckon the ubs analysts they point out that the csi 300 index has been penalised more than its asia pacific or emerging market peers in other words there is limited upside on the asx from good news on trade the other implication is that investors might be way too complacent around the threat to the australian economy and sharemarket posed by a deteriorating global trade environment certainly financial market economists are remarkably sanguine around the threat from the us china stoush they argue that measures taken by chinese policymakers to stimulate in response to any slowing in the economy as a result of heightened trade tensions will benefit australia by boosting demand for our exports bank of america merrill lynch economists also point to a structural improvement in our export sector as members of the growing chinese middle class come to australia on holidays and to study two sectors which represented a fifth of export earnings in 2018 advertisement also the aussie dollar will depreciate and cushion the economy from external threats what s more monetary and fiscal stimulus is already in the works economists at ubs are less convinced that policy measures will be as effective in cushioning the impact of a trade related hit to global growth the typical rba easing cycle has rates fall by three percentage points so the capacity for monetary policy support with rates at 1 25 per cent is clearly constrained the currency typically acts as an automatic stabiliser as it falls and offsets some of the hit to growth by making our exporters more competitive but our currency against the us dollar already trades at around its lowest since the gfc and fiscal stimulus will have a lagged impact they argue alarmingly ubs estimates australia will be the hardest hit from an escalation in the us china trade spat that results in america imposing 25 per cent tariffs on the remaining us270 billion of chinese imports in this scenario aussie economic growth in 2020 halves to 1 2 per cent against the 2 4 per cent forecast under their current base case scenario only new zealand which recently was home to the most expensive sharemarket in the world would be hit as hard aussie shares look like they have more to lose than gain in the unfolding trade drama

the democratic primaries were historic in so many ways the diverse pool of candidates expanded the national conversation to issues long ignored in national politics they talked about the gender pay gap civil rights for transgender americans and structural racism yet there was one glaring omission moderators and democrats on the stage basically ignored puerto rico there were no questions about the us territory s massive debt crisis no questions about the island s high poverty rate no questions about how to fortify the island s fragile power grid these problems have existed for years but came into sharp focus after hurricane maria s category 4 winds pummeled the island in october 2017 in fact puerto rico was only mentioned once during the back to back debates former hud secretary julián castro brought it up when asked about the cost of preparing for climate change after i announced my candidacy i went to san juan puerto rico people should know if i m elected president everybody will count he said that s it that s the only time anyone mentioned puerto rico and it didn t go unnoticed 20 candidates 5 moderators 2 debates and only one mention of puertorico in a

ignoring puerto rico is a big mistake about 3 million people live on the us island territory and as american citizens they can vote in every presidential primary puerto ricans who live there can t vote in the general election unless they live on the us mainland and the estimated 1 2 million puerto ricans who live in florida are an important voting bloc in a super competitive state with the exception of castro and sen elizabeth warren who ve made campaign stops in san juan the democratic candidates vying for the white house have made minimal efforts to address the issues that puerto ricans care about at least eight candidates have weighed in on puerto rico s political status and the push for statehood according to nbc latino but haven t explained how they would help resolve the divisive matter warren introduced a debt restructuring plan for puerto rico in may a month later sen bernie sanders proposed a bill to increase access to medicaid and food stamps on the island but puerto rican advocacy groups believe it will take much much more to dig puerto rico out of the worst economic crisis in the island s history here are just two of puerto rico s pressing issues that the next us president and arguably the current one need to address the debt crisis and economic downturn puerto rico a us territory since 1898 is worse off than any other place in the united states unemployment is at 7 7 percent nearly double the national rate and 44 percent of residents live in poverty to be clear puerto rico was already in horrible shape before the storm hit the local government was bankrupt from years of irresponsible borrowing and congress s decision to let certain tax incentives expire for us companies doing business there democratic gov ricardo rosselló filed for bankruptcy like protection in 2017 after defaulting on payments to wall street creditors puerto rico owed 74 billion in bond debt the government there is operating under strict federal fiscal oversight which has brought punishing austerity measures an independent bankruptcy like court operating under the promesa act has been helping puerto rico restructure its debt and board members asked rosselló to come up with a new post hurricane fiscal plan i asked julio ricardo varela co host of the in the thick political podcast and founder of latino rebels what questions he thinks candidates need to address varela who was born and raised in puerto rico pointed to the unpopular obama era promesa oversight board which acts like an over controlling parent and the austerity measures straining puerto rico s economy after hurricane maría struck the island the situation there has only gotten worse what would you do to help puerto rico recover financially varela said he wants candidates to answer while investment in puerto rico has spiked post maria it s nowhere near enough to lift up the economy to pay off the government s debts as part of the austerity plan rosselló plans to shrink the government to about a third of its size and close about a quarter of its public schools among other moves the next president needs to have a concrete plan to lift puerto rico out of this black hole resolve the political status of puerto rico the status of puerto rico has been the main political issue on the island since the united states annexed it in 1898 at the end of the spanish american war over the years congress has ceded small amounts of autonomy to puerto rico which now operates as a quasi state it has an independent elected local government but without all the power and benefits of being a state including a lack of real representation in congress puerto ricans are american citizens but they don t pay federal income taxes if they live on the island they pay payroll taxes to fund social security and medicare but the island gets limited funding for medicaid and food stamps strong political divisions within puerto rico over the future of the island have made it easy for congress to ignore petitions to become a us state there s no consensus among the island s 3 5 million people about whether it s better to join the united states remain a commonwealth or gain complete independence the island s current economic crisis which began around 2008 has renewed the effort to gain statehood more federal money would flow to puerto rico if it were a state though it would also increase federal taxes on the people who live there in june 2017 after the pro statehood party swept into power puerto ricans on the island voted to join the united states as the 51st state it was the fifth time the island has held a non binding referendum on whether to join the republic the vast majority voted in favor of statehood 97 percent the largest number yet the problem is that fewer than a quarter of registered voters turned out to the polls that was mostly the result of a boycott from the anti statehood political groups who were upset with the wording of the referendum puerto rico s non voting representative in congress house delegate jenniffer gonzález colón recently introduced two house bills that would allow puerto rico to become the 51st american state one before hurricane maria hit and the other last summer the puerto rico admission act would create a task force to immediately start the process of transitioning puerto rico into a us state which would happen by january 1 2021 the latest bill has 53 republican and democratic co sponsors but nothing has moved forward since and many puerto ricans want to know if the next president is fine with the current second class status of the island is puerto rico a colony of the united states why or why not is another question varela said he wants candidates to answer puerto ricans vote the 3 500 square mile island in the caribbean looks tiny on a map but the population is dense more americans live in puerto rico than in nevada montana or maine so voters who live on the island send a fair amount of delegates to the democratic national convention during primary season puerto rico s estimated 59 delegates outnumber those in more than half of us states for example about 58 800 voters in puerto rico cast ballots during the june 2016 democratic primary the island ended up pledging 37 delegates to hillary clinton and 23 to bernie sanders in the republican primary that year florida sen marco rubio won all 23 delegates for a decade now puerto rican families have been resettling in central florida largely because of the limited economic opportunities on the island and more recently because of the hurricane the number of puerto ricans living in central florida had climbed to more than 332 000 even before hurricane maria hit and demographers believe they will soon outnumber cuban americans as the largest latinx group in florida the arrival of puerto ricans over the past 15 years has helped flip the once republican orlando region into a democratic stronghold puerto ricans are widely considered swing voters but tend to vote for democrats puerto ricans also overwhelmingly despise trump who repeatedly denigrated hurricane survivors and keeps trying to withhold disaster aid so whoever wins the democratic nomination will more than likely have boricua support but is their contempt for trump enough reason to get high turnout at the polls that s still unclear which makes it all the more surprising that democrats squandered an opportunity to directly acknowledge puerto rican viewers during their first debates in miami
the relevant question is whether public investment projects have a multiplier above 1 0 and therefore pay for themselves over time though higher economic growth the oecd says a 0 5 per cent boost to gdp from extra investment would lift britain s output by 0 6 per cent it would cut the debt ratio by 0 2 per cent over the next year nota bene the notion that deficit spending can cut debt burdens is laid out in the classic text fiscal policy in a depressed economy by former us treasury secretary larry summers timely stimulus avoids the hysteresis damage of mass unemployment the incoming tory

the g20 this weekend faces its biggest collective challenge since the group of world leaders first met in november 2008 in the jaws of the financial crisis a toxic trifecta of growing political instability escalating trade tensions and slowing global growth would be challenge enough but the perils don t stop there beyond that the nineteen leaders of the world s largest economies and the european union gather as history s tectonic plates shift underneath them how the g20 plays out in its group setting and perhaps more importantly in the sideline meeting between us president donald trump and chinese leader xi jinping will shed light on whether today s leaders are up to the challenge of navigating those unsettling interlocking shifts they include new dangers of major power conflict the related struggle between democratic and authoritarian capitalist systems uncertainties about the nature of us global engagement after 70 years of relative consistency questions regarding the relevance and capability of global institutions including the g20 to manage emerging threats and an escalating competition for the commanding heights of next generation technologies and whether they will be harnessed for the common good or will instead create a new battlefield so i ll be scoring the g20 meeting on friday and saturday both from the market watcher s lens of short term economic impact and from the historian s perspective of longer term geopolitical stability do the most important leaders of their times have the vision wherewithal and chemistry both to navigate present dangers and lay out an agenda to advance longer term cooperation what makes this moment even more perilous is that world leaders come to the table with far less cohesiveness nursing wounds from a series of trade skirmishes following president trump s abrupt shifts on iran mexican tariffs and immigration enforcement raids his fellow leaders hope he might be ready to do a multilateralist makeover this week in japan and join his colleagues in common cause unlikely as that might sound to his critics the emerging danger of a 2020 recession may mean that his re election depends upon it beyond that governments and major central banks have nowhere near the fiscal and monetary tools given low interest rates and high public debt that were available to them before 2008 to manage unanticipated shocks most worrying is that the us federal reserve the closest thing to a global central bank due to the dollar s leading role enters this downturn with a depleted arsenal a benchmark policy rate of 2 25 to 2 5 compared by 5 25 in september 2007 and japanese and european central banks are already in negative rate territory so how to cut further most advanced economies have more debt and larger deficits than they had in 2008 that leaves less room for stimulus spending despite european central bank president mario draghi s calming of global markets last week by signaling that if the economic outlook doesn t improve he might restart using monetary tools such as quantitative easing the unconventional purchase of securities to increase the money supply and encourage private lending and investment the monetary and fiscal interventions and private sector backstops used after the 2008 financial crisis simply cannot be deployed to the same effect today writes economist nouriel roubini one of the few economists to predict the us housing market crash of 2007 and 2008 under these conditions a severe enough shock could usher in a global recession even if central banks respond rapidly particularly telling last week was fed chairman jerome powell s reasoning for last week s market moving decision not only to hold rates stable but also to signal a lean toward further easing than tightening when governors next meet july 30 31 an anticipated cut of at least a quarter percentage point and perhaps as much as a half point would be the first since december 2008 powell for months had resisted president trump s demands that he reduce rates unprecedented pressure for a us president to place on his independent central bank powell and fed governors are more likely to move now spurred more than anything else by the global impact of trump s trade policies and resulting tensions with china rather than due to us economic fundamentals the case for a somewhat more accommodative policy has strengthened said powell last week it s really trade developments and concerns about global growth that are on our minds the downward growth shift is sobering the world bank this month cut its 2019 global growth forecast to 2 6 from 2 9 and cut its forecast for growth in trade to 2 6 from 3 6 the world bank had already forecast the us to slow to 2 5 in 2019 from 2 9 in 2018 and for china to slow to 6 2 from 6 6 those worrisome numbers are made more so by what world bank president david malpass said is driving them falling business confidence the slowest pace of global trade growth since 2008 and sluggish growth in emerging and developing economies yet to handicap the g20 meeting only through a statistical lens would misunderstand the larger forces at work finding common purpose to strengthen international trade norms may be the most crucial issue before g20 leaders this week but lurking beneath those trade tensions are political instabilities as far as the eye can see from iran to venezuela and from europe s brexit to north korea markets are hoping that trump and xi will at the very least agree to a trade truce that would avoid the imposition of additional tariffs it will be far harder for them to achieve anything more ambitious to cool down their escalating technology conflict or to restore trust the wall street journal reported over the weekend that the us commerce department had escalated its efforts to put a brake on chinese advances toward quantum computing by barring major chinese developers from obtaining cutting edge us technology over the next 150 days the trump administration as well is looking at whether to require that all next generation 5g gear used in the united states be produced outside china lurking as the largest concern among g20 members are fears regarding what experts call deglobalization driven above all by fears of an increased decoupling of the us and chinese economies markets haven t even begun to price in that danger and its potential impact on product costs and existing supply chains so resist the temptation on this summer weekend to turn off the news from japan to enjoy more leisurely

central bank weekly talking points with the g20 summit in osaka japan this weekend fed funds have steadied around an implied 62 probability of three 25 bps interest rate cuts this year the reserve

normalization process finally died fed funds still discounting three rate cuts this year with the g20 summit in osaka japan this weekend interest rate markets have steadied over the past week the

it is not often that global bond markets and global stock markets simultaneously hold as divergent a view as they do today as to the world economic outlook while global bond markets along with the world s central banks are now signaling that real trouble might lie ahead for the united states and global economies stock markets are partying like there were no tomorrow considering that the bond markets are generally very much more accurate economic forecasters than is the stock market equity investors should be asking themselves what the bond markets might be seeing that they are missing a clear sign that global bond markets are increasingly concerned about the world economic outlook is that a record 13 trillion of foreign government bonds now offer negative interest rates a clear indication that bond markets are worried about the possibility of a us economic recession is that us long term interest rates are significantly below short term interest rates this so called yield curve inversion has in the past consistently proved to be a highly reliable indicator of an impending recession evidently the world s central banks share the bond market s gloomy economic outlook no longer is the federal reserve talking about raising interest rates but rather it is contemplating when to start cutting rates meanwhile the european central bank is now raising the possibility that it will soon resume its aggressive bond buying program to stimulate a weakening european economy to be sure bond markets and the world s central banks are generally sensitive to economic and political risks however what seems to have them now on high alert is that this time around there are an unusually large number of such risks that have as high chance of materializing furthermore they worry that it if those risks do materialize they would have the potential to destabilize both the us and the global economies among the more immediate of these risks is that the united kingdom the world s fifth largest economy could crash out of the euro without a deal both the bank of england and the international monetary fund are warning that such an occurrence would most probably result in a 5 decline in the uk economy in the year immediately after its european exit this would be bound to have significant spillover effects to a european economy that is already on the cusp of a recession heightening the chances of a hard brexit is the commitment by boris johnson who is almost certain to become the next uk prime minister to have the uk leave the european union with or without a deal on october 31 that is when the uk s extended deadline to negotiate a brexit deal with the european union ends johnson is making this commitment to fend off a mortal challenge to the conservative party from nigel farage s surging brexit party seemingly the only thing that can stop a hard brexit would be a successful vote of no confidence in the government before october 31 however this would hold out the prospect that a very market unfriendly jeremy corbyn could become prime minister which would be bound to undermine uk investor confidence a more serious albeit less imminent threat to the global economy is the risk that we could have a recurrence of the italian sovereign debt crisis with the italian economy being approximately 10 times the size of that of greece and with it having the world s third largest sovereign debt market an italian debt crisis would pose an existential threat to the euro s survival that would almost certainly reach our shores heightening the risk of an italian debt crisis is the reckless policy path on which its populist government is embarked at a time that the country is already saddled with europe s second largest public debt to gdp ratio after greece the italian government is insisting on the introduction of a large unfunded tax cut that would raise its budget deficit to around 5 of gdp president trump america first trade policy constitutes a further major source of risk to the global economy not only is the deterioration in us china trade relations and the accompanying import tariffs on china already causing a significant economic slowdown in china the world s second largest economy trump s threat to slap a 25 import tariff on european automobiles sometime later this year could be the final straw that pushes an already ailing german economy into recession sensing these risks as well as that coming from heightened geopolitical tensions in the persian gulf the world s major central banks have become decidedly more dovish than before meanwhile sensing that real economic trouble is brewing abroad global bond markets are now anticipating that a weak global economy will lead to several interest rate cuts in the year ahead a key question that equity owners should be asking themselves right now is whether they might be missing something that the central banks and the global bond markets are seeing

wobbly week of trading reflect cautious optimism on the part of investors ahead of a key trade meeting between president donald trump and president xi jinping of china set for this weekend the trade

other s goods could hurt global economic growth and corporate profits investors are in a wait and see mode in advance of the g 20 meetings said kate warne investment strategist at edward jones the

extending them to everything china ships to the united states the two sides are in a stalemate after 11 rounds of talks that have failed to overcome u s concerns over china s acquisition of american

extracted by u s companies are taken into account investors are hoping that the meeting between trump and xi will restart trade negotiations between the two countries despite worries over trade

today the g20 summit gets underway in japan with the subsequent talks set to dominate the news agenda over the course of the next few days the most interesting meetings are scheduled for saturday meaning that on monday the market will open with a gap on both the american and chinese markets the main focus will still be on the us china negotiations interestingly the media leaked information from informed sources that trump and xi jinping had agreed in advance that after the meeting they will announce a truce in the trade war so not to create too much of a negative effect to the markets added to this us treasury secretary steven mnuchin stoked things up further by stating that the agreement is 90 ready of course this does not mean it will be accepted and executed on the one hand the markets understand this and try to avoid making any sharp movements the dollar index stood still at the level of 96 18 on thursday on the other hand the investors are rather tired with the trade war issues and a certain optimism fed by rumours from the media is included in the us indices quotes last session the stock markets closed in different directions dow jones lost 0 04 s p500 grew by 0 38 and nasdaq composite was in green by 0 67 the hang seng which closed yesterday 1 42 higher and the nikkei 225 which added 1 19 probably believe in a positive resolution of the us china situation as for macroeconomic statistics it is interesting to pay attention to the published us initial jobless claims the data showed an increase of 10k to 227k while analysts expected a more modest increase to 220k this affected the eurusd fall with the rate dropping from 1 1372 to 1 1355 within an hour after the data was published however it later kicked up and during the first g20 hours on friday it was going vertically upwards above 1 1390 investors came out of the dollar fearing what decisions will be made at the summit as mentioned by the fxpro analyst team it is also worth opening the economic calendar today to check the actual core pce value for may y y despite the data being released with a month delay it could increase the volatility in pairs with the dollar the fact is that this value still cannot reach or consolidate above the key level of 2 now it is 1 6 with a similar forecast this indicator is monitored by the fed based on it the regulator decides whether to normalize the monetary policy or not since the beginning of the year the underlying inflation rate has slowed influencing powell s decision to suspend a series of interest rate increases if the analysts expectations are not justified and the data turns out to be even worse than the forecasts the triumphant start to the day for the eurusd will get additional support and send the pair up to 1 141 and potentially even higher if we see an increase in value it will help the dollar to stabilise itself for a moment and adjust its course against the euro however any news from the g20 may be stronger crude oil apparently tired of growing and following thursday dropped to 65 46 per barrel losing 1 55 investors are worried about trump s views on keeping energy prices as low as possible at the same time saudi arabia requires the support of the white house to ensure the safety of tankers in the persian gulf

china trade breakthrough president trump is under intense pressure to make progress toward a trade deal with china at this weekend s group of 20 summit in japan as lawmakers and businesses anxiously wait for an end to damaging tit for tat tariffs mosads trump is set to meet saturday with chinese president xi jinping in a bid to revive negotiations that fell apart in may the summit is the latest attempt to cement a deal to lift u s tariffs on chinese goods in exchange for structural reforms meant to curb alleged chinese trade abuses and technology theft the trade war between the world s two largest economies has hindered economic growth in both nations over the past 12 months u s tariffs on 250 billion in chinese goods have strained china s slowing manufacturing sector while beijing has targeted the ailing u s agricultural sector with levies on 60 billion in american crops and livestock those tensions will come to a head this saturday as trump and xi sit down with pressure to break the deadlock in trade negotiations if the two make progress it could clear the path toward an eventual deal to eliminate tariffs but if trump emerges unsatisfied or empty handed from his meeting with xi that could risk escalating a trade war with severe economic and political costs i ve got more on the risks and potential rewards here the path forward the first step toward a broader deal is likely an agreement to halt further tariffs while negotiations continue which xi reportedly demanded as a condition for meeting with trump but the president still faces several other economic and political challenges in securing broader agreement trump has demanded stricter protections for u s intellectual property technology along with greater u s access to chinese financial markets that would require china to overhaul its economy in ways long resisted by beijing raising doubts about the viability of a larger deal china has also insisted that trump lift the tariffs he imposed on chinese goods which trump has ruled out doing on several occasions and trump s blacklisting of huawei a chinese tech firm with purported ties to the country s intelligence agencies has also become entangled in talks political cover now risks ahead republican lawmakers have given the president unequivocal support in his battle with china even as farmers in their states and districts suffer under retaliatory tariffs he s using the tools at his disposal to get a good deal for the american farmer is it painful yes it is very painful but if we can get a good deal out of this pain right now we can endure said sen joni ernst r iowa this is not just about a trade war this is about whether or not china is going to participate in the world economy said sen john kennedy r la 2020 ramifications but if trump is unable to come away with even a moderate victory against china it could damage his standing in states like ohio michigan wisconsin and pennsylvania that have lost industrial jobs for decades those states were crucial to trump s victory in 2016 and could make or break his reelection bid higher tariffs on chinese goods and the expected retaliation against american farmers could also hamper the u s economy which is already expected to slow over the next 18 months i worry that even if there s a trade agreement that from a kansas point of view that we will now have a lot of work to regain the markets that we ve lost said sen jerry moran r kansas china is a hugely important market and particularly in regard to soybeans which we raise a lot of so there s a lot of challenges in the absence of trade in the short term but even in the long term he continued one of the goals in our country is to get our sons and daughters to return to family farms nobody would look at the family farm today and think this is a good time to return home and when our kids can choose other careers the latest china s foreign ministry has indicated that it hopes the u s can meet halfway on trade after the countries failed to reach an agreement earlier this year leading the day dem candidates rip trump on china ahead of crucial trade summit democratic presidential candidates criticized president trump s trade war with china during thursday s primary debate in miami arguing that his use of tariffs is the wrong weapon in the president s rightful battle with china trump s democratic challengers agreed with his concerns about anti competitive trade policy from china and the authoritarian regime s efforts to expand its global influence but they criticized trump for using tariffs on billions of chinese goods to push beijing into negotiations creating immense economic costs for both nations the china challenge really is serious this is not something to dismiss or wave away said south bend ind mayor pete buttigieg but their fundamental economic model isn t going to change because of some tariffs democrats argued that trump s tariffs addressed real concerns but created unnecessary economic harm for u s farmers manufacturers and consumers sen michael bennet d colo said trump should instead unite global allies to curb china s alleged practice of intellectual property theft steel dumping and currency manipulation andrew yang a tech entrepreneur added they do pirate our intellectual property and it s a massive problem but the tariffs and the trade war are just punishing businesses and producers and workers on both sides buttigieg said that the only way to defeat china as they use technology for the perfection of dictatorship is to focus on sprawling domestic investments not the export balance on dishwashers the biggest thing we ve got to do is invest in our own domestic competitiveness if we disinvest in our own infrastructure education we are never going to be able to compete buttigieg said tax policy also took center stage in the opening questions of thursday s democratic presidential debate the first question moderators asked in the thursday s 2020 democratic presidential debate went to sen bernie sanders i vt asking him if he would raise taxes on the middle class to pay for his proposals sanders said that he has a plan to pay for every proposal he s offered such as canceling student debt with a tax on wall street trades former vice president joe biden said that the country has massive income inequality and can reduce tax loopholes he added he wants to eliminate president trump s tax cuts for the wealthy sen kamala harris d calif touted her proposal to give low and middle class household a tax credit of up to 6 000 or 500 per month on tap next week congress will be in recess until the end of the july 4th weekend good to know the trump administration on friday announced sanctions against the son of venezuelan president nicolas maduro

by donald j trump s 2020 election strategy is to connect his potential democratic opponents with socialism trump plans to use this attack on the democrats even if senator bernie sanders who proudly calls himself a democratic socialist doesn t become the presidential nominee sanders has been decisively re elected in vermont senator elizabeth warren is distancing herself from the socialist label she went so far as to tell the new england council i am a capitalist to my bones sanders and warren are not what they claim to be they are both updating roosevelt s new deal and more closely resemble the social democrats that have governed western european democracies for years delivering higher standards of living than that experienced by americans the original doctrine of socialism meant government ownership of the means of production heavy industries railroads banks and the like nobody in national politics today is suggesting such a takeover as one quipster put it how can washington take ownership of the banks when the banks own washington confronting trump on the socialism taboo can open up a great debate about the value of government intervention for the good of the public sanders can effectively argue that people must choose either democratic socialism or the current failing system of corporate socialism that choice is not difficult such an american democratic socialism could provide almost all of the long overdue solutions this country needs full more efficient medicare for all tuition free education living wages stronger unions a tax system that works for the people investments in infrastructure and public works reforms for a massive runaway military budget the end of most corporate welfare government promotion of renewable energies and the end of subsidies for fossil fuels and nuclear power in my presidential campaigns i tried to make corporate socialism also called corporate welfare or crony capitalism a major issue small business is capitalism free to go bankrupt while corporate capitalism free to get bailouts from washington is really a form of corporate socialism this point about a corporate government was documented many years ago in books such as america inc 1971 by morton mintz and jerry cohen now it is even easier to make the case that our political economy is largely controlled by giant corporations and their political toadies today the concentration of power and wealth is staggering just six capitalist men have wealth to equal the wealth of half of the world s population the wall street collapse of 2008 2009 destroyed eight million jobs lost trillions of dollars in pension and mutual funds and pushed millions of families to lose their homes against this backdrop the u s government used trillions of taxpayer dollars to bail out in various ways the greedy financial giants whose reckless speculating caused the collapse in may 2009 the moderate senator from illinois dick durbin said the banks hard to believe when we re facing a banking crisis that many of the banks created are still the most powerful lobby on capitol hill and they frankly own the place is there a single federal government agency or department that can say its most powerful outside influence is not corporate even the labor department and the national labor relations board are under more corporate power than union power who better than trump on an anti socialist fantasy campaign kick can call attention to the reality that big business controls the government and by extension controls the people in september 2000 a business weekpoll found over 70 percent of people agreeing that big business has too much control over their lives this was before the horrific corporate crimes and scandals of the past two decades maybe that is why support in polls for socialism against capitalism in the u s is at a 60 year high people have long experienced american style socialism for example the publicly owned water and electric utilities public parks and forests the postal service public libraries fdic guarantees of bank deposits now up to 250 000 social security medicare and medicaid etc what the public is not sufficiently alert to is that big business has been profitably taking over control if not outright ownership of these public assets in the new book banking on the people by ellen brown readers can get an idea of the way large banks insurers and the giant shadow banking system money market funds hedge funds mortgage brokers and other unregulated financial intermediaries speculate and shift deep risk and their failures onto uncle sam these corporate predators gouge customers and remarkably show a deep aversion for productive investment as if people matter moreover they just keep developing new ever riskier multi tiered instruments eg derivatives to make money from money through evermore complex abstract secret reckless entangled globally destabilizing networks gambling with other people s money is a relentless wall street tradition the crashes that inevitably emerge end up impoverishing ordinary people who pay the price with their livelihoods will the democrats and other engaged people take trump on if he tries to make socialism the big scare in 2020 control of our political economy is not a conservative liberal or red state blue state issue when confronted with the specifics of the corporate state or corporate socialism people from all political persuasions will recognize the potential perils to our democracy no one wants to lose essential freedoms or to continue to pay the price of this runaway crony capitalism the gigantic corporations have been built with the thralldom of deep debt corporate debt to fund stock buybacks while reporting record profits consumer debt student loan debt and of course government debt caused by drastic corporate and super rich tax cuts many trillions of dollars have been stolen from future generations no wonder a small group of billionaires including george soros eli broad and nick hanauer have just publicly urged a modest tax on the super wealthy as hanauer a history buff and advocate of higher minimum wages says the pitchforks are coming
