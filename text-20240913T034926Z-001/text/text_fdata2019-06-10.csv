2000 2001 budget speech yesterday minister of finance and economic planning mr gerald ssendaula read government s budget proposals for the financial year 2000 2001 below is his speech in full in which ssendaula highlights how the adverse effects of drought limited growth to 5 1 he also pointed out that external trade shocks especially depressed coffee prices on the world market also hurt foreign exchange earnings during the last financial year your excellency the president mr speaker sir honourable members of parliament i beg to move that parliament do resolve itself into a committee of supply for the consideration and approval of the revised revenue and expenditure estimates for the year 1999 2000 and the budgetary proposals for the estimates of revenue and expenditure for the fiscal year 2000 2001 1 mr speaker sir our economic performance during this financial year has very clearly demonstrated the benefits of the sound fiscal policies that we have consistently implemented and of the robustness of the ugandan economy which is the product of a decade of radical economic reforms real gdp has expanded by 5 1 and inflation has been kept firmly under control gross domestic product gdp growth 2 while our rate of growth this year is lower than our medium term target rate of 7 it still represents a very credible performance because our economy has faced both an extended drought in many parts of the country and a severe external trade shock with depressed prices for coffee on world markets and a sharp rise in world oil prices the fall in world coffee prices alone cost uganda us 57 million in lost export earnings in the first eleven months of the fiscal year the ugandan economy has weathered the shocks it faced much better than most other developing countries and uganda s growth rate of 5 1 compares very favourably with that of other developing countries both in this region and elsewhere in the world i should point out that the average rate of real gdp growth in africa in 1999 was only 2 3 while the average rate of growth in all developing countries was only 3 8 3 our gdp growth this fiscal year was lower than targeted for two main reasons first production of cash crops was seriously affected by drought and coffee wilt disease and this also had knock on effects for agro processing industries secondly the external terms of trade shock reduced real incomes and cut demand for output across many sectors of the economy nevertheless the economy has remained reasonably buoyant with the utilities sector manufacturing construction and transport and communication all registering real growth of 8 or higher in this fiscal year 4 i expect economic growth to recover in the coming fiscal year and that over the medium term we will achieve our target average growth in gdp of 7 per annum economic growth will be spurred by the reforms which we are implementing in the power and telecommunications sectors which will ease some of the main bottlenecks to increased production as well as by the expansion of the roads program which will improve market opportunities in the rural areas inflation 5 inflationary pressures increased in the first half of the fiscal year with annual headline inflation rising to a peak of 10 6 in november 1999 inflation rose because the drought sharply pushed up food prices and because exchange rate depreciation led to an increase in the price of imported goods the subsequent risen petroleum prices also stoked up the inflationary pressures nevertheless inflation has been brought firmly under control since november by mid last month annual headline inflation had fallen back to 2 4 while underlying inflation which excludes food crop prices had fallen to 3 8 per annum 6 we have been able to keep firm control over inflation only because government implemented fiscal restraint in response to the revenue shortfalls and because the bank of uganda tightened monetary policy to moderate the growth of money supply through increased sales of treasury bills had we not cut government expenditures in response to the large revenue shortfalls government s domestic bank borrowing would have increased leading to a rapid expansion of the money supply and fuelling higher inflation the consequence of higher inflation would have been the erosion of private sector confidence in the economy which would have severely damaged prospects for private investment and economic growth in the coming fiscal year government will remain totally committed to its long standing policy of holding inflation to an average level of no more than 5 per annum exports and imports 7 our major export industries suffered a series of setbacks in this fiscal year total export earnings are projected at only 450 million compared to 549 million last fiscal year earnings from coffee exports tell by more than 100 million because of both the decline in output and a 25 fall in world market coffee prices coffee output fell by about 17 compared to the last fiscal year because of the drought and the coffee wilt disease which has now spread to all robusta growing districts in addition the ban imposed by the european union on imports of fish from uganda reduced our earnings from fish exports by more than us 30 million 8 imports increased only marginally fromus 1 38 billion to us 1 39 billion due to the depreciation of the shilling effects of lower export prices and the sharply increased oil prices on real incomes and expenditures the exchange rate 9 the fall in export earnings led to pressure on the exchange rate and the shilling has depreciated by 9 against the dollar during this fiscal year although the rate of depreciation was less against other major currencies such as the euro because the dollar itself has appreciated on world currency markets the depreciation of the shilling was caused primarily by the external terms of trade shock combined with the strength of the dollar on world markets the shilling has also been subjected to speculation in the last few weeks the bank of uganda has aggressively fought this speculation by tightening liquidity and intervening in the foreign exchange market to support the shilling the banking sector 10 mr speaker sir government has taken steps to further strengthen the framework for banking supervision and regulation the statutory unimpaired minimum paid up capital requirement for banks was raised by statutory instrument to shs 4 billion banks which were already in operation were required to have a minimum paid up capital of shs 2 billion as of january 1st this year and have until january 1st 2003 to comply fully with the shs 4 billion minimum capital requirement the higher capital requirements are essential to provide banks with a buffer against losses and to give bank owners strong incentives to ensure that their banks are managed prudently so as to safeguard their depositors funds a new financial institutions bill is being drafted and will soon be submitted to parliament i believe that the actions we have taken to improve bank regulation and supervision and to enforce compliance with the banking laws have yielded positive benefits for bank customers and for the financial soundness of the banking industry 11 this is borne out by the improvement in the financial performance of the banking industry the ratio of non performing loans to total private sector loans declined from 22 9 in june 1999 to 12 8 in march 2000 the capital base of the banking industry has increased by more than 50 in the current fiscal year commercial banks deposits expanded by almost 16 in the first nine months of this fiscal year commercial banks deposits expanded by almost 16 in the first nine months of this fiscal year 12 last year government decided to refund the private sector customer deposits in the three banks which were closed in 1998 99 however in my last budget speech i announced that in future government would revert to its policy of only reimbursing insured deposits that is deposits up to a maximum amount of shs 3 million it is important for the government to protect small deposits covered by the deposit insurance fund but it is equally important that the larger depositors take responsibility themselves for choosing the banks in which they deposit their money the bank of uganda can supervise the banks and enforce the banking regulations but no banking regulator anywhere in the world can guarantee that a bank will never fail developed economies provide incentives for prudent management of this sector by combining public regulation and market discipline private credit rating agencies which evaluate the financial condition of banks on a regular basis as in some latin american countries can contribute to enhancing market discipline in the banking industry i intend to examine how best to encourage the development of private sector bank rating agencies in this country 13 mr speaker sir the most urgent outstanding issue in the banking sector is the future of uganda commercial bank ltd ucbl has been under the statutory management of the bank of uganda for almost 15 months i believe that despite the good management temporarily provided by the bank of uganda the central bank should not be managing a commercial bank for this long government policy is to re privatise ucbl to a core investor with reputable banking credentials as soon as possible re privatisation is essential before ucbl can resume lending to the private sector because ucbl needs the capital and strong management which a reputable bank investor can provide in order to rebuild its loan portfolio without incurring the huge loan losses that have crippled the bank in the past 14 a key element of both our poverty eradication action plan and the plan for the modernisation of agriculture is the provision of sustainable financial services to the poor worldwide experience shows that micro finance institutions mfs can supply these services efficiently and effectively provided that they are free to charge their borrowers interest rates which cover the cost of funds including the administrative cost of lending and the risks involved with lending worldwide experience also shows that it is the availability of capital and not the cost of capital which is a constraint to microenterprises mfis should also be free to mobilise savings but it is imperative that mfis which take deposits or other forms of savings from the public are properly regulated a policy framework for the prudential regulation of deposit taking mfis has been submitted to cabinet and draft legislation based on the policy framework is being prepared for tabling in the house in the coming financial year 15 in a liberalised financial system the effectiveness of monetary policy depends in part on the flexibility of monetary policy instruments and the speed of response that these instruments allow the monetary authorities the main tool of monetary policy the weekly treasury bill auction was a major innovation when it was introduced in 1992 but as the financial system has deepened and monetary policy has become more important for managing liquidity in bank borrowing would the economy it is becoming apparent that a weekly tb auction no longer provides sufficient prevailing conditions in money markets the bank will combine the weekly issue of treasury bills with repurchasing arrangements with the commercial 16 banks 16 in order for the financial sector to be able to play its role effectively and to encourage longer tend investment there is also a need for additional financial instruments to allow for the mobilisation of long term savings i believe that establishing the market in long term savings is a public good to this end beginning july 2000 the government will introduce long dated bonds with maturities of two three and five years these bonds will be auctioned by the bank of uganda in tile same manner as the treasury bills of shorter maturities and will be tradeable on the secondary market through the uganda securities exchange the introduction of long term government securities is intended to provide savers with an additional financial instrument in which to invest their savings thereby stimulating more competition for long term assets the bond will also give investors an additional tool to assess the cost and relative profitability of their long term investment and help to deepen capital market activities revenue performance fiscal year 1999 2000 17 fiscal management in the current fiscal year was dominated by the impact of the large revenue shortfalls the government responded appropriately to cut back its expenditures this was the only option first to prevent an increase in govertiffient borrowing from the banking system in light of the inflationary pressures which were already intensifying and secondly to avoid breaching the government borrowing targets agreed with the international monetary fund however once inflation was brought firmly back under control it was possible to accommodate a modest increase in government borrowing within our monetary framework in the second half of the fiscal year this enabled government to restore some of the cuts in expenditures especially on development projects which are vital for the economy in the long run i would like to pay tribute to my staff who were able skillfully to negotiate with the imf an amendment to our program to accommodate this increase in government expenditure 18 the performance of non tax revenue has continued to lag behind at under 1 of gdp compared to about 3 5 in other countries in the region to improve on this performance i am already critically reviewing other possible sources of nontax revenue and at the beginning of the next financial year the budgeting and collection accounting systems for non tax revenue will be streamlined the measures to be implemented will include a mandatory requirement for monthly returns from receivers of revenue supported by valid official receipts or declaring a nil return in the meantime all receivers of revenue have been advised to submit their revised rates before the end of this financial year for implementation 19 effective july 1 2000 1 will return to the subject of revenue performance later in my speech before presenting my revenue measures for the next financial year projected expenditure outturn for fy 1999 2000 20 mr speaker sir allow me now to turn to the expenditure outturn for this fiscal year the outturn for government domestic expenditure under the recurrent and domestic development budgets is projected at shs 1 351 billion compared with the approved budget of shs 1393 billion the additional domestic expenditure of about 24 above the budget outturn for 1998 99 had been targeted through the poverty action fund towards the key sectors for reducing poverty including budget support from donors the overall funding for poverty action fund program increased by 85 21 in 1999 2000 government paid shs 144 billion to clear domestic arrears i am glad to report that the commitment control system which i introduced this year has stemmed the accumulation of domestic arrears as a result the stock of verified and known arrears has fallen from shs 261 billion at end june 1999 to shs 210 billion 22 the outturn of donor budget support grants is projected to be us 187 million of which hipc and enhanced hipc amounts to us 52 million budget support loans are projected at us 95 million project loans from donors are expected to amount to us 145 million and donor grants for projects are projected at us 218 million budget outputs 23 over the last year the budget that government has funded together with our donor partners has been translated into the following physical outputs in primary education 2 500 classrooms have been constructed and a further 3 300 partly built classrooms have been completed in addition over two million textbooks have been purchased resulting in a pupil to textbook ratio of 5 to 1 in 1999 2000 compared with 12 to 1 in 1997 98 in the health sector although 48 lc iv health centres had been targeted for upgrading in some cases work is still ongoing the same applies to the recruitment of qualified staff for these centres in addition development of the minimum health care package has been finalised government expenditure on our main roads infrastructure in 1999 2000 estimated at shs 48 billion has facilitated work on 9 600 kilometres of highway roads through routine manual maintenance 7 400 kilometres through routine mechanical maintenance and 350 kilometres though periodic maintenance in addition work on the roads between kampala and entebbe and mbarara and ibanda was finalised and commissioned during this financial year government has also spent shs 28 billion on the rehabilitation of 1 200 kilometres of feeder roads and shs 12 billion in carrying out routine and periodic maintenance on 9 000 and 1 200 kilometres of feeder roads respectively in the agriculture sector 530 graduate extension workers have been recruited and out of the 450 motor cycle purchased for the recruits 225 have been allocated to districts the balance is expected within the next two months for water and sanitation last year i announced the creation of the new districts water conditional grant of shs 4 billion 1 am glad to inform you that during the current financial year 1 408 boreholes have been drilled and fitted with hand pumps in addition 525 bore holes were rehabilitated and 398 shallow wells 166 rain tanks and 14 gravity flow schemes were constructed whilst 304 springs were protected the impact of recent budgets on poverty 24 a comparison between the preliminary findings of the 1999 2000 household survey and the equivalent survey carried out in 1992 93 demonstrates the impact that our policies and budgets are having especially on the incomes of rural households 25 agriculture extension services were available to 17 of households in 1999 compared to 11 in 1992 according to community level information in 1999 extension workers were the main source of information on agricultural practices for 31 of communities in the east 21 in the west and 17 in the central region while the north experienced the largest increase in the coverage of extension this was from a small base because for 96 of communities the radio was the main source of information on agricultural practices extension access increased in 31 of the communities in the west and in 27 of the communities in the centre for 41 of the communities in the west the private sector constitutes the main source of information on farming practices overtaking both radio and the public servants as the primary source of information 26 the number of households owning cows rose from 11 in 1992 to 20 in 1999 with the increase in the ownership being distributed equally across all regions regionally over the same period the ownership of cows increased from 8 to 16 in the central region from 12 to 21 in the east from 9 to 18 in the north and from 14 to 22 in the west the availability of veterinary services seems to be better than the coverage of the crop extension services cattle are held in 82 of the communities in uganda of which 66 have access to publicly funded veterinary services 27 in 1992 the poorest 20 of the population shared 18 6 of enrolment in primary education by 1999 the share of the poorest 20 of the population had risen to 24 2 an increase that largely benefited girls from rural areas in 1999 17 of rural household had access to formal credit compared with 8 in 1992 in 1999 access to formal credit ranged from 24 in the west to 20 in the east 12 in central region and 6 in the north most of this credit has been used for productive investment 45 of the loans were used to establish non agricultural enterprises 24 were invested in education and health 14 went to purchase inputs 9 was invested in land and livestock and 7 was used to buy household goods 29 in the water sector access to safe water in the rural areas has risen from 11 in 1986 to 46 in 1998 in the urban areas access to safe water has increased from 44 in 1986 to 50 in 1998 30 in health outcomes infant mortality rates had declined from 188 per 1 000 live births in 1986 to 88 per 1 000 live births in 1998 between 1993 and 1996 in the health sector the number of visits to government health facilities by all groups of the population regardless of sex age gender or location increased 31 mr speaker sir during the 1992 99 period levels of per capita income have grown significantly without a deterioration in income distribution that is the evidence from the household surveys conducted between 1992 93 and 1999 2000 so our economic growth has not only been robust it has also been pro poor in fact the evidence from the household surveys shows that households with low levels of income in 1992 but who had labour and capital assets were able to benefit the most from overall economic growth during the period medium term economic and budgetary strategy the link between the poverty eradication action plan peap the medium term expenditure framework mtef and the budget 32 mr speaker sir for our annual budgets to be effective in achieving our long term aim of poverty eradication four elements are essential firstly government as a whole must maintain a clear understanding of the priorities for intervention by the public sector which will lead to the reduction and eventual eradication of mass poverty secondly we must over time identify the cost of our priorities to enable us to mobilise the required level of funds to carry out the necessary actions in addition we must identify those activities which are currently implemented with government funds but which could be carried out more effectively by the private sector in order to enable the government to reallocate savings to higher priorities of government expenditure thirdly we must embody the costs that will need to be absorbed over the medium term in a format that can show how much is to be spent and what progress is being made in the achievement of our ultimate goal finally we must ensure that the financing of the large poverty eradication programs does not endanger macro economic stability 33 the first and second of these elements are contained in the poverty eradication action plan which was first produced in 1997 and whose revision is currently in the final stages of completion in consultation with a wide range of stakeholders this revised peap was the basis for uganda s poverty reduction strategy paper prsp which satisfied the requirement for uganda s completion point thereby allowing our access to the enhanced hipc debt relief initiative 34 the third and fourth essential elements are contained in the medium term expenditure framework and in the annual budgets the preparation of the annual budget is increasingly a collective effort through wide consultation and increased transparency and with participation of all stakeholders in the different levels of this process although it is not possible for all stakeholders and beneficiaries to be completely satisfied with the budget allocations they get through the local government budget framework papers the planning and budgeting process has been extended to the local governments significantly enhancing the articulation of their budget strategy and prioritisation of expenditure requirements and the efficient allocation of resources therefore before we allocate public funds to the areas that we jointly decide will best address the public needs over the medium and long term we need to demonstrate that the relevant budget policy issues have been identified and widely debated 35 mr speaker sir although i have made every effort to ensure wide participation in the budget process i recognise that members of parliament are still not as involved as they would like to be to tackle this challenge early in the next financial year i will be making proposals to parliament for a bill to amend the public finance legislation particularly addressing the time table of parliament s involvement in the budget process i have already secured some resources under the 2nd economic and financial management project to facilitate parliamentary participation in this activity in addition to improve transparency and communication with the public my ministry has issued the citizen s guide to the budget process to be launched today this initiative will ensure even greater participation by stakeholders in the budget preparation process in future 36 the government will continue to follow its strategy of fiscal discipline in support of its macro economic objectives of high rates of broadly based economic growth with low inflation and a sustainable external balance therefore budget discipline will continue to be non negotiable although this means that the treasury will continue to be unpopular the medium term expenditure framework of which this budget is a part will continue to be the main tool of the government for allocating public resources based on strategic priorities the resource envelope 37 government is planning to spend shs 2 232 billion in the coming fiscal year of which shs 2 124 billion is accounted for by the recurrent and development expenditures and a further shs 108 billion is accounted for by the clearance of domestic arrears we will require shs 129 billion for repaying external debt our expenditures and debt repayments will be financed by a mixture of domestic revenues and donor budget and project support domestic revenues will account for shs 1 141 billion or 47 of the resources we require to finance our expenditures and debt repayments donor grants which include the debt relief received under the hipc and enhanced hipc initiatives will provide shs 757 billion or 31 of our total resources while the remaining shs 536 billion or 22 will be provided by disbursements of donor loans all of which will carry highly concessional repayment terms with a grant element of between 60 and 80 of the value of the loan the difference between our resources and expenditures represents our fiscal savings reflected by a build up of our deposits in the banking system 38 the overall fiscal deficit excluding grants will rise in the next fiscal year to 10 1 of gdp before falling back below 10 in the following two years the rise in the deficit in the coming fiscal year is entirely attributable to the substantial increase in donor support for the poverty reduction programs and projects in the budget the deficit including grants will be kept to a very modest 2 3 of gdp in the next fiscal year this deficit will be entirely funded by highly concessional external loans with a grant element of between 60 and 80 and therefore poses no threat to either fiscal sustainability or macro economic stability 39 because of our very strong record of economic reform uganda was the first country in 1998 to be granted debt relief under the highly indebted poor countries hipc debt relief initiative i am pleased mr speaker to inform you that last month uganda became the first country to qualify for additional debt relief under the enhanced hipc debt relief initiative uganda qualified for debt relief under the enhanced hipc initiative on the strength of our poverty eradication policies as set out in our poverty reduction strategy paper and our continued excellent economic performance under the poverty reduction and growth facility program agreed with the imf under the hipc and enhanced hipc initiatives uganda will receive debt relief amounting to 86 million in the forthcoming fiscal year 82 million in 2001 02 and 84 million in the following year as with the first hipc initiative all of the resources freed up by debt relief under the enhanced hipc initiative will be used to fund projects under the poverty action fund the poverty action fund paf 40 honorable members as you will recall we established the poverty action fund to enable us to show in a transparent manner how the funds from the original hipc initiative and now the enhanced hipc are spent on programs that directly reduce poverty these programs are identified in the revised poverty eradication action plan under the two goals of improving the incomes of the poor and improving the quality of life of the poor 41 mr speaker sir to ensure that the budget spent under the poverty action fund achieves our objectives i have initiated a new process of reporting on the utilisation of the funds and a new release mechanism for transferring the funds there will be a requirement for annual and quarterly work plans to be agreed between each district and the relevant sector ministry a uniform quarterly reporting process and strict adherence to the reporting and planning processes to trigger the release of quarterly funds where these conditions are not met it will not be possible to disburse the funds and these will be either re allocated or saved for use in the following year these measures will increase the impact of paf programs promote accountability and ensure that we properly monitor the impact of these funds private investment 42 government is firmly committed to creating an attractive and enabling environment for supporting the development of the private sector as the engine of growth for this purpose government has formulated a medium term policy framework the medium term competitive strategy mtcs for the private sector for the period 2000 2005 the framework forms a basis for the medium term government interventions to promote private sector development outlining key policy changes and reform strategies the priority actions identified are in the areas of reform of infrastructure provision roads and telephone communication strengthening the financial sector and improving the regulatory framework for access of the poor to financial services fostering commercial legal sector reforms undertaking institutional reforms that deal with corruption in areas of public procurement and simplifying tax administration the framework also addresses improving the business environment for micro and small enterprises placing emphasis on human capital development 43 mr speaker sir as i have noted above one of the major constraints to uganda s potential for investors and entrepreneurs is the ineffectiveness of our commercial justice system remedying this shortcoming has been identified by the justice law and order sector as one of two priority areas and a program has been submitted to our donor partners for review and funding the envisaged program is estimated to cost us 7 million over a four year period and is expected to start during financial year 2000 01 the privatisation process 44 honorable members you will recall that during the current financial year uganda clays ltd was privatised and became the first company to be floated on uganda s stock exchange more recently a 51 share in utl has been disposed of to an international consortium for us 33 520 600 in addition the uganda electricity board is in the process of restructuring in accordance with the 1999 power sector strategic plan ueb will be unbundled into separate distribution generation and transmission businesses each to be privatised as long term concessions privatisation will reduce the contingent liabilities arising from the guarantee by the government to support the 250 megawatt bujagali independent power project whose power should come on stream by 2004 the target date for completing the distribution privatisation is june 2001 to protect the public interest the electricity regulatory authority has been created in accordance with the 1999 electricity act and the directors appointed 45 since 1993 93 public enterprises have been divested including 31 liquidations and 46 public enterprises including utilities remain for reform and divestiture in 2000 01 the privatisation process will include among others the sale of shares in apollo hotel and the national insurance corporation to strategic equity partners and the forthcoming floatation of shares in b a t and kinyara sugar works 46 the uganda railway corporation urc is in the early stages of commercialisation in the coming financial year government will seek to increase the efficiency of urc s operations and to prepare the enterprise for eventual divestiture 47 in consultation with key stakeholders the urban water sector reform strategy is currently being prepared to guide the sector reform and commercialisation process this is to be completed in early 2000 01 48 i am pleased that the policy of reducing the level of utility arrears owed by government is now beginning to have a positive effect utility arrears created in 1998 99 alone by government amounted to shs 16 billion the unpaid bills for 1999 2000 are expected to be less than shs 6 billion to further improve on this effort i have advised all budget strategy for 2000 01 49 mr speaker sir up to now a relatively neglected feature in our approach to budgeting is ensuring the efficiency with which our financial resources are utilised and the effectiveness of our expenditures in terms of meeting set objectives with regard to the latter we need to measure our achievements in terms of agreed outputs leading to outcomes consistent with our objectives this requires identifying performance indicators which can be monitored in terms of improved infrastructure or in terms of the improved delivery of public services the money that is spent through our budget comes from taxpayers here and abroad it is therefore imperative for us to measure outputs and outcomes and thus demonstrate our cost effective use of taxpayers money and show more clearly the benefits of the budget to the people of uganda and to the citizens of our development partner countries 50 starting with the budget framework paper this year a number of sectors have committed themselves to certain levels of outputs outcomes achievements over the medium term for example under primary education there are targets among others for enrolment for the pupil teacher ratio and for the pupil to classroom ratio the health sector has committed itself to improving immunisation rates from a level of 35 in 1998 99 to 95 by 2002 03 and to increase the level of trained staff at health centres from 33 in 1998 99 to 65 in 2002 03 rural and main roads together with water and sanitation sectors have also set highly visible output targets over the medium term these innovations are expected to expand to the other sectors such as agriculture and justice law and order which are currently developing their sector wide approaches towards policy reform and investment programming 51 with regard to efficiency in the use of resources government is placing greater emphasis on ensuring that taxpayer resources are spent efficiently and according to the budget plan we need to strengthen the efficiency of our payment mechanism tighten expenditure controls and to ensure full accountability for the use of financial resources the implementation of a second economic and financial management project next year with support of the world bank and the nordic development fund will support these objectives furthermore the government is earmarking 5 of the resources under the paf for monitoring and accountability budget expenditure proposals for 2000 01 52 allow me mr speaker sir to turn now to next years expenditure proposals which are based on this financial years achievements and the requirements to address the major goals of the poverty eradication action program prioritised for the fiscal year 2000 01 ensuring security and good governance 53 mr speaker sir as honourable members will know from their interactions with his excellency the president the security sector is an integral part of our good governance agenda the development rationale for security sector reform is clear and most compelling it sets the wider context for the specific focus on military expenditure in recent years the poor have already prioritised security of person and property as the major concern for their well being as established by the extensive consultations carried out under the uganda participatory poverty assessment project we need resources to improve conflict prevention conflict resolution and for peace building to avoid frustrating our poverty reduction efforts by perpetually entrapping our people in growing poverty in addition conflict and insecurity within uganda and in the great lakes region impact very negatively on private sector investment particularly the inward investments necessary to achieve the high levels of economic growth rates required to accelerate development 54 effective security sector reform and conflict prevention depends on integrated policy making and coherent approaches to these issues at the regional and international levels we need accurate assessments of the threat to our security and genuine security needs in order to determine the appropriate country specific levels of military expenditure the effectiveness of military expenditure is just as important as the legitimacy of security needs therefore contributions to our efforts in common strategies for resolution by our neighbours and by our development partners are most welcome taking the above into consideration level of government expenditure on defence is expected to be a maximum of 2 of gdp in the medium term 55 the justice law and order sector has made considerable progress during the current financial year in the process of identifying sector wide goals and priorities the two identified priorities are the reform of the commercial justice system and criminal justice reform a part of this process has included a review of potential cost savings from within the sector the main areas which have been reviewed are prisons farms police vehicles court awards and the backlog of cases in the high court and in the lower courts implementation plans are being drawn up in each area 56 the most advanced plan relating to prisons farms has identified that the current prison population can be fed with the produce from only four farms out of over twenty currently run by the prisons department this would eliminate the need to purchase food for prisoners in the medium term however budget releases will have to reflect the needs of the crop planting and growing seasons i am therefore reviewing i treasury cash release arrangements to ensure that this saying potential is fully realised and that the savings are channeled towards improving the conditions of prisoners in addition the prisons department will be assisted to develop a business plan for commercial operation of the remaining farms conflict prevention and 57 mr speaker sir if we are to reduce successfully both the actual level of corruption and the perceived level of corruption in public life in uganda it is important to ensure that adequately qualified and experienced personnel are in place in the audit and accountancy cadres with the funding available under the second economic and financial management project government will be recruiting suitable staff during the next financial year measures to improve the quality of life of our people education 58 the success of universal primary education upe is well documented and i do not intend to dwell on this remarkable progress here however in order to ensure that we continue to improve the quality of the primary education we must recruit motivate and train adequate numbers of teachers although the primary school teachers establishment was raised from the 1998 99 level of 94 000 to about 125 000 in march this year only 87 000 had by that time accessed the payroll this is partly due to difficulties in funding the district service commissions and i am pleased to report that these commissions are to be fully funded in 2000 01 thus removing this bottleneck moreover it has now been agreed that properly qualified teachers will be recruited on probation and put on the payroll immediately pending their confirmation in service later when they have gone through the interview process this will raise the budget for primary school teachers salaries from shs 114 billion this year to shs 144 billion in 2000 01 and shs 178 billion by 2002 03 59 in the medium term it is forecast that 17 000 new classrooms will be constructed with a further 2 900 of the partially built classroom completed this decentralised pro 60 in order to improve accountability in primary schools it has been decided to institute at the sub county level school performance awards to primary schools making the greatest improvement in accounting and record keeping in addition two further awards will be given for schools excelling in the promotion of girl s education and those of special needs children shs 0 8 billion have been provided for these purposes under upe during next fiscal year secondary education for the gifted poor students 61 government recognises that access to secondary education for right students from poor families is curtailed by lack of financial resources to meet the secondary school requirements it is therefore the intention of government target resources towards able but financially constrained students to this end a scheme to award bursaries scholarships to deserving students in every sub county is being proposed the details regarding the operationalisation of this scheme will be finalised in the fy 2000 01 62 government is also considering including secondary and vocational education under the poverty action fund within the constraints of the medium term expenditure framework so as to address adequately the needs of these two sub sectors by 2002 03 we expect to have established 850 community polytechnics as a strategy for promoting technical and vocational education and training in 2000 01 i have provided shs 1 4 billion for the establishment of the first 40 centres health taking health care to all 63 i am glad to report mr speaker that the national prevalence rate for hiv aids decreased from 18 5 in 1995 to 9 5 in 1998 it is essential that an intense program to combat hiv aids is maintained in order to reduce the prevalence rate further due to the multi sectoral approach to tackling hiv aids a national strategic framework for hiv aids activities has been developed with three major goals to reduce the rate of infection by 35 to about 6 2 by 2005 to mitigate the health and socio economic effects at all levels and to strengthen the national response capacity to the epidemic apart from the shs 2 billion for the aids control program under the next financial year the funding for the uganda aids commission has also been put under the paf with a provision of shs 1 billion in addition the new non sectoral pma conditional grant under the paf will include shs1billion to local councils iii for multi sectoral aids activities 64 an important determinant of the utilisation of health care is the access of the poor to health centres in the next financial year 65 health centre ivs are planned for completion and the remaining 44 will begin to be upgraded as a start to improve the access to health care 10 health centre iis will be built in those sub counties with the least health centres 65 in 1998 99 childhood immunisation rates for diptheria pertussis and tetanus fell to 44 from 79 in 1994 in response government plans to ensure that outreach visits provision of transport payment of allowances community sensitisation and provision of cold chain fridges are planned for in the district work plans financed through the primary health care conditional grant grants to the ministry of health for procurement and donor contributions the target coverage rates for the end of the financial year 2000 01 is 55 66 the separate payment of salary and lunch allowance to medical workers has often caused a delay in the disbursements of funds salary and lunch allowances for medical workers will be consolidated from 1st july 2000 and an equivalent amount for lunch allowance added to the unconditional grant for districts water and sanitation 67 it has been decided to increase the coverage of water supply and sanitation facilities in rural areas and growth centres with populations of 50uo and below to achieve this goal the amount of water and sanitation conditional grant is being increased substantially to shs 21 billion for the next financial year aiming at a safe rural water coverage for 82 of the population by june 2003 in the same period government also intends to extend safe water coverage and sanitation facilities to 75 of the population in small towns 68 the shortage of water for livestock in the karamoja region is a cause for concern funds have been specifically earmarked from paf for the construction of water reservoirs two reservoirs have already been constructed at kilong and kulodwong and two more are under construction at loodon and locagar in moroto district designing of more dams in mbarara hoima and kumi districts is also underway to ameliorate the water shortages in these areas environment and the wetland 69 mr speaker sir in the coming year government intends to begin developing a strategy for the protection arid regulation of the environment under the leadership of the national environmental management agency in order to focus on priority areas in the wetlands sub sector i am providing shs 300 million in 2000 01 to be administered under the poverty action fund to ensure the responsible use of our wetlands mountainous areas river banks and lakeshores similarly we must ensure the enhancement of our waste management systems land 70 to resolve the conflicts over land prevalent in many of our rural communities we need to implement the land act quickly and cost effectively this will also reduce the threat to social stability and enable rural communities to focus on increasing their rate of development for 2000 01 shs 3 0 billion is provided rising to shs 6 5 billion in 2001 02 and shs 10 5 billion in 2002 03 functional adult literacy 71 government recognises that for farmers to be able to effectively receive use and further disseminate extension messages a minimum level of literacy is required in addition adult literacy will enhance the quality of life and build self sufficiency and confidence therefore i have provided shs 1 billion from the poverty action fund to support the adult literacy program in 200 0 1 measures to increase the incomes of our people 72 mr speaker sir development of our main roads infrastructure is vital to the structural transformation of our economy our main roads strategy is set out in our 10 year road sector development plan for the financial year 2000 01 government will provide a budget of shs 56 7 billion supplemented by a further provision of shs 23 5 billion from our donor partners for expected outputs of 9 800 kilometres of main road routine manual maintenance 8 150 kilometres of main road routine mechanical maintenance and 1 800 kilometres of main road periodic maintenance in addition government will continue with ongoing work to strengthen upgrade and rehabilitate 460 kilometres of our main road infrastructure rural feeder roads urban roads and waterways 73 i am providing shs 27 billion for the rehabilitation of 800 kilometres of feeder roads and for the routine and periodic maintenance of 15 000 and 1 000 kilometres of feeder road respectively 74 mr speaker sir our waterways have not been considered among our priorities in recent years i am therefore proposing to provide the sum of shs 5 4 billion in 2000 01 for the development of uganda s inland water transport system 75 the recently completed plan for the modernisation of agriculture pma is a holistic strategic framework for eradicating poverty through multi sectoral interventions enabling the majority of our subsistence farmers to improve their natural resource based livelihoods in a sustainable manner the challenge for government in this framework is first to create an enabling environment that allows these small enterprises to thrive and secondly to invest in the public goods that improve the productivity of farming and other rural natural resource based income generating activities agriculture 76 during the last financial year government started on a major restocking program which will continue throughout the medium term as part of the pma in addition for next year i am happy to announce a number of new related interventions firstly next fiscal year government will allocate shs 2 5 billion for the production and distribution of cotton seeds through the cotton development organisation and shs 1 5 billion for coffee seedlings through the uganda coffee development authority this is an interim measure in support of the dissemination and adoption of productivity enhancing technologies and pending the private sector taking over to organise and manage the provision of these inputs particularly with the privatisation of the uganda seeds project in 2000 01 the funds to be accessed by ucda are hi addition to the 1 per annum received through cess funding and should be channeled into replacing coffee plants lost due to coffee wilt disease and into expanded coffee production i also appeal to coffee farmers and traders to maintain the quality of the produce to ensure uganda s continued competitiveness in the international market 7 secondly a start will be made in the phased implementation of the national agricultural advisory service naads with an initial budget provision of shs 2 0 billion our agricultural extension services have clearly lacked effectiveness with 64 of households reporting in 1999 that they lacked access to effective extension services the naads will as part of the pma initiate a new demand driven approach the agricultural extension program will be revised to bring on board existing extension workers in addition to the newly recruited graduates furthermore i am introducing a new non sectoral pnm grant starting with an initial allocation of shs 6 7 billion in the next year which is designed to empower local council iii governments to undertake grassroots level poverty reduction interventions including shs 2 2 billion for the recruitment of community development officers to mobilise the population in principle this money can be spent on any antipoverty program decided upon by the lc iii the grant is conditional only because it has access conditions but i must emphasise that its end use is not sector specific i envisage that this non sector conditional grant to lc iii governments will in future be the main channel for funds to implement the pma improving the performance of public service public service reform pay and pensions pay revision 78 the total wage bill is projected to rise from shs 407 4 billion to shs 468 8 billion this will provide for a minimum increase of 5 across the board in line with inflation i am proposing a 10 salary increase for lower ranks among primary school teachers police and prisons staff a modest start will also be made in implementing the recommendations of the pay strategy report prepared by the ministry of public service particularly to address the plight of the middle rank professionals salary arrears 79 there is an ongoing enhanced recruitment exercise particularly for primary teachers health workers and agricultural extension graduates as a result many of these employees now have appointment letters and can access the payroll this current fiscal year a total of shs 7 6 billion was paid for residual salary arrears between 1992 and 1998 in this budget 1 am providing shs 3 billion to cater for the arrears expected to accrue through the ongoing recruitment and revalidation of appointments exercise the district service commissions will from now on benefit from a special paf district conditional grant for monitoring and accountability starting with shs 2 7 billion next financial year 80 my honourable colleagues will recall that the restructuring of government ministries was completed in may 1998 the implementation is ongoing all officers who retired due to the abolition of offices following this restructuring have been paid their severance packages restructuring of constitutional commissions and bodies has been completed and will be implemented by 31 st december 2000 the review of the structure and staffing of 14 districts will be completed and implemented by 30 november 2000 pensions 81 one of government s policy objectives is to liberalise the pension sub sector to allow ugandans to freely choose their own pension provider government s role should be to provide the regulatory framework to ensure that all pension providers meet minimum standards of managerial and financial professional competence and probity within this framework the nssf will operate and compete with other service providers but government believes that the financial management of nssf must improve to enable it to fully provide the level of benefits in the future to which its members are entitled it has become increasingly clear that the present pension arrangements for government employees are not fiscally sustainable if we are to avoid imposing an unsustainable burden on future government budgets we must act promptly to replace the current pay as you go system with a unified contributory system in the first half of the financial year 2000 01 government will undertake a comprehensive study on the pensions sector covering all existing schemes with a view to achieving the above policy objectives to save the pensioners from travelling long distances to collect their payments the pensions payroll management will be decentralised as part of this process 82 mr speaker sir government has computerised the pensions management system and the results of a public service pensioners census will be used in july 2000 to set up a comprehensive pensions database this will enable payment of pensions to be made by the 28th of each month the majority of pensioners have had their pensions validated and the remaining validations will be completed during financial year 2000 01 83 mr speaker sir i am finally able to announce that the committee reviewing the liabilities to former employees of the east african community has completed its task and has agreed the total liability in the sum of shs 60 billion of which shs 15 billion has been paid so far payment of the remaining shs 45 billion will start subject to resolution of the pending high court case by the former employees against government measures for improved accountability and expenditure control commitment control 84 honorable colleagues while i have been pleased to announce that the commitment control system has sharply curtained the accumulation of new payments arrears in the majority of votes i regret to say that potential recurrent expenditure arrears still persist for a small number of votes although at shs 6 billion the quantum of the fresh arrears is significantly down in comparison to the shs 80 billion which was accumulated in the previous financial year here i note that any accounting officer who carries into 2000 01 recurrent expenditure arrears created in 1999 2000 will be responsible for paying those arrears as a first call on cash released out of normal budget allocations moreover during the course of this year if new arrears continue to arise strong disciplinary action will be instituted against the accounting officers concerned 85 by the end of this fiscal year a sum of shs 144 billion will have been paid out of the outstanding stock of domestic arrears of shs 261 billion at june 1999 leaving a balance of shs 117 billion in 2000 01 shs 108 billion will be provided for arrears related to the supply of go and services by the private sector parastatal organisations pension court awards payment to former eac employ and gratuities for abled soldiers the balance out of this stock of arrears of shs 26 billion will be paid in 2001 02 86 mr speaker sir 2000 01 following success so far achieved in controlling recurrent expenditure the commitment control system will be extended to the development budget i recognise that this will be a more complex exercise because many development projects involve contracts that extend across many months and in cases across financial years however i am confident that with the experience of containing recurrent expenditure arrears we can quickly move towards the elimination of new development expenditure arrears transparency 87 1 will now turn to the issue of budget and accounting transparency which i also raised last year during 1999 2000 a number of important steps were taken in developing the budget preparation process these steps included the much greater involvement of the districts which among other things entailed continuation of the initiative to develop performance indicators suitable for each economic sector this facilitated a more focused process of monitoring and evaluation by producing the local government budget framework papers this enabled most local governments to better prepare review and articulate their inputs to the national budget framework paper at a much earlier stage i am pleased to note that in addition to participation by the public servants there was also enthusiastic involvement on the part of local councillors this was a joint approach from the centre and enabled broad based consultation in the course of agreeing guidelines for the use of paf conditional grants 88 in 2000 01 we must continue to pursue improved transparency together with improved accountability across all aspects of government s financial and physical activity i have to emphasise this point because a central feature of paf is that in the event of a breakdown of adequate accountability it will not be possible to release any more funds this will demand a level of accountability much greater than we have previously experienced therefore it has been decided that effective from the next financial year local governments will submit their monthly accounts by the 20th day of the following month to both the treasury and the ministry of local government this will plug a major gap in our information system enabling the central government to track the utilisation of funds on a monthly basis constitutional autonomous bodies 89 mr speaker sir the budgetary proposals of the accounting bodies have been submitted in compliance with article 155 2 of the constitution in compliance with article 1 55 3 of the constitution the government has made recommendations on them i hereby lay both the budgetary proposals and the recommendations of the government before the house as required by the constitution 90 in order to enable me to submit a complete national budget for your consideration in accordance with article 151 1 of the constitution the budget provisions of these self accounting bodies incorporated into the medium term expenditure framework are in accordance with the resource envelope conveyed to the self accounting bodies during the course of our discussions local government transfers and decentralisation reform 91 mr speaker sir to increase the level of decentralisation it has been decided that from the next financial year unconditional grants for 13 municipalities will be sent directly to them through separate votes thus a sum of almost shs 2 billion has been earmarked for this purpose put of the total outlay of just under shs 72 billion for unconditional grants in 2000 01 this is a significant change and will address the demands of urban authorities who have been under pressure to improve the basic infrastructure in towns except for the capitation grant under universal primary education conditional grants to urban authorities will continue to go through the districts until the sector ministries finalise the arrangements for their direct allocation to these authorities 92 in my budget speech last year i announced modest funding of shs 2 billion towards implementing governments constitutional obligation to provide equalisation grants to local governments based on the degree to which they are lagging behind the national average for a particular service this provision has been doubled to shs 4 billion for the next financial year in consultation with the local government finance commission it has been decided that the grant will now be made available to 40 urban authorities in addition to 24 districts compared with 13 districts for this financial year 93 i am pleased to announce that from next financial year kampala district will also start accessing funds for rural feeder roads maintenance decentralisation of the development budget 94 government is committed to enhance the program for decentralisation of the development budget beyond the ongoing program for classroom construction i am happy to report that under the local government development program shs 29 billion will be disbursed to local governments in the next financial year as budgetary support to finance locally prioritised development needs in addition more funds will be available for classroom construction primary health care facilities water and sanitation and the dutch district development grant for 7 districts all this amounts to shs 113 billion however with increasing resources being made available to government through complementary programs such as the local government development program and the second economic and financial management project there is an urgent need for all implementing ministries to mark out a clear road map showing the capacity gaps and time frame for addressing these capacity issues this process needs to be concluded early in financial year 2000 01 95 government has put in place a process that increasingly capture all financing to local governments in both the national and local budgets government will work with donors to improve planning budgeting and financial systems particularly through the second economic and financial management project to ensure that all resources to local governments are fully captured 96 mr speaker sir my ministry has worked together with the ministry of local government and the local governments during the last two years to improve the planning and forecasting mechanisms within the local governments one of the main target areas has been and continues to be the estimation and collection of local revenues whilst the forecasts are now produced on a much more realistic basis the tax base remains narrow and is heavily dependent on graduated tax i therefore urge all local governments to review systematically the tax base and put forward suggestions for the widening of their tax base and for streamlining their collection methods including consideration of the potential for private sector involvement 97 local governments are now implementing most of the government s programs aimed at eradicating poverty funds for this purpose are transferred in the form of conditional grants to local governments for which a sum of shs 330 billion has been earmarked for the next financial year this represents an increase of 46 over the outlay for conditional grants last year funds that have been saved as a result of the highly indebted poor country hipc debt relief initiative are channeled to local governments in the form of the poverty action fund together with additional funds from our donor partners through 11 conditional grants paf transfers to local governments will amount to shs 316 billion in order to help local governments utilise funds better all poverty action funds will be released to them on a quarterly basis 98 we have recognised that there is need to have uniform standards for local governments regarding the creation of posts and for their general administrative structures we cannot allow the indiscriminate expansion of staff strength in local governments as in time we would find that more funds are being used for pay allowances pensions and other administrative expenditures rather than spent on developmental activities aimed at poverty reduction with this aim in mind the ministry of public services will assist districts to rationalise their administrative structures revenue outturn for 1999 2000 99 for 1999 00 we budgeted for revenues of shs 1 132 billion of which shs 1 100 billion was to come from ura collections now i am expecting an outturn of shs 1 008 billion for this year of which ura collections will be about shs 980 billion as is clear from these figures there will be a major shortfall of shs 120 billion in ura collections in 1999 00 100 some unexpected developments in 1999 00 had an adverse impact on our plans at the time of preparing revenues estimates last year we had expected that the economy s rate of growth would be higher than was actually achieved with lower economic growth imports were lower than expected and as imports account for a high proportion of total revenues this had a big adverse impact on collections the drought and the deterioration in our external of trade also had a significant dampening effect of the pattern of consumption and investment which led to lower revenues from domestic transactions to compound these problems the gains which we expected from improved tax administration did not materialise 101 it may be useful to reflect a little on the pattern of our revenue performance in recent years in 1996 97 our revenue to gdp ratio was just over 12 but this declined to just over 11 in 1997 98 the ratio improved to 11 9 in 1998 99 but this year it has declined again to 11 2 the same as we achieved in 1997 98 unfortunately this revenue to gdp ratio compares very unfavourably with the average of about 16 for sub saharan africa 102 even with our low revenue gdp ratio we are still faced with strong pressures for tax reductions maybe as edmund burke said way back in 1775 to tax and to please no more than to love and be wise is not given to man or maybe the track record we have established over many years of continuously lowering tax rates has created unrealistic expectations the big tax reductions we have made over the past 5 years have certainly improved incentives and made compliance a little easier we now have a very fair tax regime and also one which is very competitive regionally and internationally even more important perhaps we now have a lot of credibility about our tax policy it has become stable and predictable our business community no longer worry about sudden u turns or from midnight tonight effects budget revenue proposals for fy 2000 2001 103 now i wish to deal with my taxation proposals for 2000 01 the full details are contained in the finance bill published today east african community 104 the treaty establishing the east african community eac was signed in november 1999 and has already been ratified by uganda this treaty is very wide ranging and provides for greater co operation in many economic social and political areas one of its more important provisions is article 75 which deals with establishment of a customs union i want to take this opportunity to stress again that uganda remains fully committed to this regional integration process customs law 105 the customs law has been consolidated to take into account numerous changes in our law since 1970 following the breakup of the old east african community this will also facilitate access by the general public especially taxpayers professionals and educators to the text of the customs law introduction of gatt valuation 106 amendments are being proposed to the customs law in accordance with our world trade organisation wto commitments in particular on customs valuation at present customs uses a valuation system based on the brussels definition of value bdv as adopted by the world customs cooperation council however under the wto agreement we like other developing countries were allowed a transitional period of 5 years to changeover from the bdv system ura has now made necessary preparations for implementing this new wto gatt valuation method with effect from 1st july 2000 duty drawback 107 a new more user friendly duty drawback scheme to facilitate exporters has been designed following consultations with ura manufacturers and exporters i expect the new scheme to become fully effective on 1st july 2000 ura will very soon publish the details of the new scheme including the refund rates for the different export products this scheme will give a much needed boost to our exporters entebbe airport 108 to stimulate use of entebbe airport for airfreight purposes i am revising the arrangements for calculating the taxes on airfreight imports the airfreight cost element will now be excluded from the customs value for tax purposes so the taxes will apply only on the cost of the imports plus the insurance costs this means that c i will substitute for the cif formula for customs purposes on goods coming in through entebbe which will further reduce the tax burden on air freighted imports motor vehicles 109 i have reviewed the excise duty regime for motor vehicles with effect from 1st july the excise duty rate is being harmonised at 10 for vehicles above 2250 cc bicycles 110 the excise duty on bicycles and bicycle spares is being eliminated and the import duty rate for both categories is also being harmonised at 15 mosquito nets 111 as an important measure to support primary health care i am abolishing import duty and vat on mosquito nets consistent with this measure and to encourage local production of these nets i am also eliminating the tax burden on imports of the netting material needed to make mosquito nets these measures should encourage people to invest in this important aid to better health agriculture 112 our tax arrangements already take due account of the overwhelming importance of agriculture in our economy however it is also important to support local industries which have strong linkages with the agricultural sector especially those producing inputs and processing outputs for this sector such as ox and tractor ploughs hoes and other related agricultural equipment to this end i am extending the vat exemption to help those producing all kinds of agricultural inputs and there will be a remission of duty on the imported raw material needed by the producers of these inputs this should lead to lower cost inputs for farmers and more employment in the industries producing these inputs printing and publishing 113 to encourage local producers of textbooks import duty on raw materials will be refunded or credited when proof is shown that the materials were used in the production of textbooks excise duty 114 the excise duty on soft drinks will be reduced from 20 to 15 with effect from 1st july 2000 in doing this however i must express the government s disappointment that past reductions in this excise duty have not benefited consumers i must emphasise that without some concession to consumers demand for soft drinks cannot respond raw materials 115 to reduce the cost of manufacturing in uganda i am waiving the 4 withholding tax and the 2 import commission on all imported raw materials given the importance of imported raw materials at this early stage of our industrial development
the minister of finance dr crispus kiyonga last friday presented the 1987 88 budget to the national resistance council the budget has already been hailed by a cross section of ugandans as the best since independence today we publish the full text the 1987 88 budget proposals when the national resistance movement took over power in january 1986 production in all sectors was very low in the areas of agriculture implements such as hoes ploughs and tractors were in very short supply chemicals and seeds were not available to the population the industry was extremely constrained by lack of raw materials and spare parts the roads were in a sorry state of disrepair and there were critical transport bottlenecks involving trucks and other equipment some areas in the country particularly the luwero triangle and the west nile region once among the richest in the country were nothing more than wasteland inhabitants having been either killed or displaced by the repressive regimes that came before us this sorry state of affairs was further compounded by the heavy external debt in 1985 debt servicing consumed 55 per cent of exports and in 1986 51 per cent on top of this mr chairman there was a huge money supply in the economy that had been building up since the early 1970s in summary therefore the nrm government found the following problems a severe shortage of supply of basic necessities like soap cloth housing blankets sugar and salt b severe bottlenecks involving shortage of transport badly damaged roads both trunk and feeder malfunctioning power and water supply lack of agricultural inputs unutilized capacity in the industrial plants c disruption of life in most parts of the country leaving behind displaced people orphans and widows d high level of insecurity e huge money supply in the economy f high rate of inflation g very unfavourable balance of payment position all this was happening in a country with substantial human and natural resources with a longer dash ample availability of fertile soils and a favourable climate indeed despite its problems uganda has continued to feed its people without significant resource to food aid this is the country that once had a diversified export base involving coffee cotton tea tobacco and copper but today the only export we can talk of is coffee in the mid 60s not only did uganda manufacture most of its basic requirements but had some surplus for export it is therefore saddening to note that today uganda belongs to the category of the poorest least developed countries in africa recent trends in the economic situation the economy of uganda has not experienced any growth for many years now this gross domestic product figures in 1946 prices indicate that between 1983 and 1985 gross domestic product declined at an average rate of 3 per cent per annum this decline continued in 1985 even though the decline in this year was somewhat less in 1986 the decline was further reduced however in 1985 and 1986 the monetary gross domestic product increased by 2 6 per cent and 0 8 per cent respectively improvement in 1986 was accounted for by the substantial improvement in transport electric power forestry and the fishing industries service sectors namely government rents and miscellaneous services also showed substantial growth in 1986 in 1986 however agriculture and the manufacturing sectors registered declines mainly due to the severe shortage of foreign exchange to import raw materials spare parts and inputs in agriculture monetary agriculture which accounts for about 30 per cent of monetary gross domestic product declined by 9 6 per cent in the same year mainly due to a decline in production of major export crops cotton production for instance declined from 16 300 tonnes in 1985 to 4 200 tonnes in 1986 and tobacco production fell from 1 600 tonnes to 900 tonnes the decline was also experienced in the tea sector between 1985 and 1986 the developing world of which uganda is part is constantly faced with a number of major problems in the international economic scene the first is the currency fluctuations which frequently affect the balance of payments position the second factor is that the debt burden of poor countries increases every day the third factor is the constant fluctuations in the prices of their exports in regard to this latter problem mr chairman it is noteworthy that over the last months the price of coffee on the world markets has dropped more than one dollar per kilogramme this has considerably depressed our foreign earnings fourthly uganda like all other poor countries spends a large portion of its foreign exchange earnings to import petroleum products mr chairman although such a proportion of our export receipts is spent on the importation of petroleum products we are not protected from the fluctuations of the oil prices on the world market because we have no control over them it is against this background that the nrm government has formulated the recovery programme recovery programme following the takeover of power in january 1986 the national resistance movement immediately formed a broad based government and moved swiftly to re establish law and order all over the country the security situation is now very much improved in most parts of the country in those areas where there are still pockets of trouble the government is quickly getting the situation under control the government has now put in place a public investment programme this programme contains very few new projects most funds will be used for rehabilitation or completing on going projects accordingly the emphasis is placed on provision for needs of industrial and agricultural rehabilitation on road rehabilitation and maintenance power generation and transmission and the provision of social infrastructure particularly health services the objective of the programme is to achieve rapid overall economic recovery and set a base for sustained economic development this will entail increasing the volume of the traditional exports and diversification of the export base promotion of efficient import substitution and better utilization of domestic resources recent economic policy announcement consequently on may 15 1987 your excellency mr president you announced a very comprehensive policy package this involved a change in the relationship between the uganda shilling from a factor of uganda shillings 14 to uganda shillings 60 to the united states dollar the producer prices were inert and by a factor of between 3 and 5 times prices for petroleum products were more than doubled the currency was demonetised by a factor of 100 and to assist in reduction of liquidity a conversion tax of 30 per cent on all cash holdings was applied mr chairman the government is quickly taking steps to build on these positive developments in the area of transport a number of trucks pick ups and buses have already been imported and many more are on order funds to finance reconstruction of the main trunk roads have already been secured these roads 1 kampala mityana 2 mityana fort portal 3 jinja kampala 4 iganga jinja 5 kampala entebbe 6 katonga kabale through masaka and mbarara 7 katuna kabale 8 mbarara ishaka 9 ishaka katunguru 10 kampala wobulenzi 11 pakwach arua 12 masindi apac lira kitgum on top of these government has made arrangements for the reopening of feeder roads all over the country following the meetings we attended recently in paris government is now assured of adequate flow of foreign funds to finance key areas in the economy the government and the people of uganda are grateful to the international community for the support and assistance that they are receiving some industries have already placed orders for urgently required raw materials and fast moving spare parts installation of new machineries in some of the factories is going on as the inflow of foreign exchange picks up more and more of our factories will be availed foreign exchange to enable them utilize their otherwise redundant capacities specific orders have already been placed for inputs in agriculture and animal industries consequently the short supply situation that has been one of the factors responsible for inflation will soon be dealt with decisively also following the success of the paris meetings we have now rescheduled approximately us 70 million of our foreign debts this will mean that these funds will be available to apply to our recovery programme rather than repayment of the debts nearly all the projects in the investment plan that are to be implemented this year have received funding the challenge now before us mr chairman is to work harder to absorb the money we have borrowed it is to be expected mr chairman that the increased producer prices you announced coupled with importation of input goods will give rise to increased production in the economy the key utilities of power and water are vigorously being attended to as their recovery is conditional to improvements in the rest of the sectors supply resource budgeting and man agement policies the government finds it desirable and is committed to pursuing tight fiscal and monetary policies specific measures are being undertaken in the tax administration area these will be outlined later on the expenditure side the close linkage between revenue and expenditure will be adhered to this is to ensure that money budgeted for investment projects and maintenance work is available when required tight measures to control expenditure are being put into place the headcount of civil servants is now complete this exercise has now defined precisely who should be on the pay roll a lot of unnecessary expenditure will be avoided following the findings of the census electricity supply was either constantly breaking down or completely unavailable some areas in the country particularly the luwero triangle and the west nile region once among the richest in the country were nothing more than wasteland inhabitants having been either killed or displaced by the repressive regimes that came before us this sorry state of affairs was further compounded by the heavy external debt in 1985 debt servicing consumed 55 per cent of exports and in 1986 51 per cent on top of this mr chairman there was a huge money supply in the economy that had been building up since the early 1970s in summary therefore the nrm government found the following problems a severe shortage of supply of basic necessities like soap cloth housing blankets sugar and salt b severe bottlenecks involving shortage of transport badly damaged roads both trunk and feeder malfunctioning power and water supply lack of agricultural inputs unutilized capacity in the industrial plants c disruption of life in most parts of the country leaving behind displaced people orphans and widows d high level of insecurity e huge money supply in the economy f high rate of inflation g very unfavourable balance of payment position all this was happening in a country with substantial human and natural resources with a longer dash ample availability of fertile soils and a favourable climate indeed despite its problems uganda has continued to feed its people without significant resource to food aid this is the country that once had a diversified export base involving coffee cotton tea tobacco and copper but today the only export we can talk of is coffee in the mid 60s not only did uganda manufacture most of its basic requirements but had some surplus for export it is therefore saddening to note that today uganda belongs to the category of the poorest least developed countries in africa recent trends in the economic situationthe economy of uganda has not experienced any growth for many years now this gross domestic product figures in 1946 prices indicate that between 1983 and 1985 gross domestic product declined at an average rate of 3 per cent per annum this decline continued in 1985 even though the decline in this year was somewhat less in 1986 the decline was further reduced however in 1985 and 1986 the monetary gross domestic product increased by 2 6 per cent and 0 8 per cent respectively improvement in 1986 was accounted for by the substantial improvement in transport electric power forestry and the fishing industries service sectors namely government rents and miscellaneous services also showed substantial growth in 1986 in 1986 however agriculture and the manufacturing sectors registered declines mainly due to the severe shortage of foreign exchange to import raw materials spare parts and inputs in agriculture monetary agriculture which accounts for about 30 per cent of monetary gross domestic product declined by 9 6 per cent in the same year mainly due to a decline in production of major export crops cotton production for instance declined from 16 300 tonnes in 1985 to 4 200 tonnes in 1986 and tobacco production fell from 1 600 tonnes to 900 tonnes the decline was also experienced in the tea sector between 1985 and 1986 the developing world of which uganda is part is constantly faced with a number of major problems in the international economic scene the first is the currency fluctuations which frequently affect the balance of payments position the second factor is that the debt burden of poor countries increases every day the third factor is the constant fluctuations in the prices of their exports in regard to this latter problem mr chairman it is noteworthy that over the last months the price of coffee on the world markets has dropped more than one dollar per kilogramme this has considerably depressed our foreign earnings fourthly uganda like all other poor countries spends a large portion of its foreign exchange earnings to import petroleum products mr chairman although such a proportion of our export receipts is spent on the importation of petroleum products we are not protected from the fluctuations of the oil prices on the world market because we have no control over them it is against this background that the nrm government has formulated the recovery programme recovery programmefollowing the takeover of power in january 1986 the national resistance movement immediately formed a broad based government and moved swiftly to re establish law and order all over the country the security situation is now very much improved in most parts of the country in those areas where there are still pockets of trouble the government is quickly getting the situation under control the government has now put in place a public investment programme this programme contains very few new projects most funds will be used for rehabilitation or completing on going projects accordingly the emphasis is placed on provision for needs of industrial and agricultural rehabilitation on road rehabilitation and maintenance power generation and transmission and the provision of social infrastructure particularly health services the objective of the programme is to achieve rapid overall economic recovery and set a base for sustained economic development this will entail increasing the volume of the traditional exports and diversification of the export base promotion of efficient import substitution and better utilization of domestic resources recent economic policy announcementconsequently on may 15 1987 your excellency mr president you announced a very comprehensive policy package this involved a change in the relationship between the uganda shilling from a factor of uganda shillings 14 to uganda shillings 60 to the united states dollar the producer prices were inert and by a factor of between 3 and 5 times prices for petroleum products were more than doubled the currency was demonetised by a factor of 100 and to assist in reduction of liquidity a conversion tax of 30 per cent on all cash holdings was applied mr chairman the government is quickly taking steps to build on these positive developments in the area of transport a number of trucks pick ups and buses have already been imported and many more are on order funds to finance reconstruction of the main trunk roads have already been secured these roads include 1 kampala mityana 2 mityana fort portal 3 jinja kampala 4 iganga jinja5 kampala entebbe 6 katonga kabale through masaka and mbarara 7 katuna kabale 8 mbarara ishaka 9 ishaka katunguru 10 kampala wobulenzi 11 pakwach arua 12 masindi apac lira kitgum on top of these government has made arrangements for the reopening of feeder roads all over the country following the meetings we attended recently in paris government is now assured of adequate flow of foreign funds to finance key areas in the economy the government and the people of uganda are grateful to the international community for the support and assistance that they are receiving some industries have already placed orders for urgently required raw materials and fast moving spare parts installation of new machineries in some of the factories is going on as the inflow of foreign exchange picks up more and more of our factories will be availed foreign exchange to enable them utilize their otherwise redundant capacities specific orders have already been placed for inputs in agriculture and animal industries consequently the short supply situation that has been one of the factors responsible for inflation will soon be dealt with decisively also following the success of the paris meetings we have now rescheduled approximately us 70 million of our foreign debts this will mean that these funds will be available to apply to our recovery programme rather than repayment of the debts nearly all the projects in the investment plan that are to be implemented this year have received funding the challenge now before us mr chairman is to work harder to absorb the money we have borrowed it is to be expected mr chairman that the increased producer prices you announced coupled with importation of input goods will give rise to increased production in the economy the key utilities of power and water are vigorously being attended to as their recovery is conditional to improvements in the rest of the sectors supply resource budgeting and man agement policiesthe government finds it desirable and is committed to pursuing tight fiscal and monetary policies specific measures are being undertaken in the tax administration area these will be outlined later on the expenditure side the close linkage between revenue and expenditure will be adhered to this is to ensure that money budgeted for investment projects and maintenance work is available when required tight measures to control expenditure are being put into place the headcount of civil servants is now complete this exercise has now defined precisely who should be on the pay roll a lot of unnecessary expenditure will be avoided following the findings of the census in addition to avoid fraud in the form of air purchasing and unnecessarily high prices a central purchasing department is being created this department will have the responsibility of doing major government purchasing for example for stationery and transport requirements as you know mr chairman a lot of government revenue is normally collected by ministries as proceeds for goods or services the government sells to the public the government does for instance sell products raised from its farms all over the country these may be food items animals or any other marketable commodity charging people for radio or television announcements is another example of how line ministries sell services to the public this money has up to date been collected by the ministries providing these services or selling the goods however the manner in which that money has been handled has left a lot to be desired i have therefore decided that this money which is popularly known as appropriations in aid will immediately be paid by the accounting officers to the treasury for credit to the consolidated fund the current budget has taken into account all financing needs for each ministry discounting availability of appropriations in aid to the ministries concerned from today therefore appropriations in aid will form part of government revenue to be disbursed to ministries through normal budgeting from year to year in the area of the parastatal organisations the government is to insist on efficiency and positive results each parastatal organisation will be expected to pay dividends to the treasury all parastatal organisations will now be required to submit to the ministry of finance audited financial statements within six months of the year ended failure to conform to these and other stipulations will call for punitive measures mr chairman the nrm government while being committed to a mixed economy is acutely aware of the constraints it faces in resource availability accordingly therefore the government has set up a committee to study the parastatal sector this will assist the government to decide on what it can at this stage manage to run in terms of financial requirements and management capabilities work is now advanced on the preparation of guidelines to be used to decide what parastatals government should retain and which ones will either be wound up or sold to the private sector it is expected that by the end of the year these guidelines will be complete and operational work is also advanced on the resolution of the departed asians properties custodian board an activated and strengthened verification committee is busy reviewing all claims to the properties the register of the properties has recently been updated a board of valuers to value all the affected properties has been appointed and by the end of the year work on selling the properties not successfully claimed will have started the money obtained from the sales will be kept in a special account to be used to compensate former owners and or reinvested in the building of new structures the government mr chairman is committed to a steady reduction in its net indebtedness to the banking system as a start 50 per cent of the money realised from the conversion tax has gone towards retiring part of this public debt with these measures in the fiscal areas therefore there will be a reduction in credit to the government and this will make it easier for expansion in credit to the private and parastatal sectors the role of the private sector in uganda mr chairman the government recognises the important role the private sector plays in the economy this role is most pronounced first and foremost on the smallholder peasant farms as these are held by individuals it is similarly pronounced in industry and in the transport sector in agriculture all the coffee exported and consumed at home is produced on peasant plots owned individually the production of cotton and tobacco is also carried out on individual peasant plots in the case of tea production is by big firms privately owned the role of the smallholder in this industry is growing and being encouraged by the government as regards industry the vast majority of the industrial establishments are in the hands of the private sector and the government will continue encouraging the private sector s role in industrial development the industrial licensing act is currently under review to enhance investment in industrial production government intends to review all existing laws and decrees which deal with the protection and privileges of foreign investment with a view to harmonizing the law and consolidating it into one statute government recognizes however that what is even more important than the legislation is the creation of a conducive environment that will give confidence to all investors it is therefore our intention to work to create and maintain a congenial climate for investment by both domestic and foreign investors foreign exchange management policy the new exchange has given rise to adequate price incentives for the production of tradable goods after the shortage of foreign exchange is alleviated and the domestic supply situation improves the government will gradually replace the current administrative system of foreign exchange allocation with an open general licensing ogl system under which importers will obtain import licences and foreign exchange immediately upon request initially the coverage of the ogl system will be limited to certain priority industries and to a number of priority items such as agricultural inputs and essential goods monetary policy mr chairman government in may changed the exchange rate of the uganda shilling vis à vis the us from 14 shillings to 60 shillings this exchange rate will continue to be operative i am glad to report mr chairman that the currency reform inclusive of the tax levy you announced in may this year was successfully and smoothly carried out all over the country in the same month this is further testimony to the popularity of the national resistance movement it is proof of the fact that the government is in full control of the security situation finally it also proves the correctness of the line that the government has taken on economic matters there is now respect and confidence in the new currency in recognition of this and your wisdom in having taken this measure mr chairman the population are referring to the new currency as the museveni dollar a recently carried out study by the bank of uganda has revealed that the monthly price index is falling for the middle income group the index in june fell by a factor of 16 3 per cent relative to may while in the low income group the corresponding fall was 11 3 per cent giving an average fall in the price index of 13 8 per cent the attitude of the population with respect to investment is changing positively a lot of investors are now turning away from the negative trend of speculation and are instead taking up investment in productive enterprises this is a move in the right direction which the government predictably knew would result from the policy package announced in may this year with this in mind mr chairman i would like now to address the question of interest rates interest rates do play a monetary role as they do regulate the cost and availability of credit and where it goes they can also help in mobilizing financial resources which can be used to achieve desired economic objectives in a situation of inflation however interest rates need to be substantially high in order to attract people to save high rates of interest however can have very damaging effects on an economy they could discourage borrowing and so curtail production given however the trends in the economy now namely falling rates of inflation and the turn towards investment in development projects i have decided to adjust interest rates downwards with immediate effect in order to encourage productive investment medium and long term loans with maturities exceeding one year will carry interest rates of between 22 and 25 per cent the exact level will be determined by the risk factors attached to a particular project interest on short term lending of a commercial nature will be fixed at 30 per cent the interest rate on shorter commercial borrowing will be reviewed in line with changes in the inflation rate naturally the expected increase in investment calls for higher savings accordingly the saving rates have been set at a range of between 18 and 22 per cent depending on the deposit maturities government is taking further steps to mobilize funds for investment in productive enterprises recently we launched a rural credit scheme to be operated by the uganda commercial bank the uganda commercial bank is also quickly rehabilitating those of its branches that had been damaged during the years of insecurity this will enable the public to save some of their earnings and these will in turn be borrowed for investment in the medium to long term it is government policy to spread banking facilities all over the country successful efforts have been made to procure finance for the uganda development bank and the east african development bank these funds are being lent to the public for investment in productive enterprises i have therefore mr chairman not found it necessary to require the commercial banks to adjust their investment portfolios as a way of ensuring that pre termined proportions of their lending go to each sector of the economy the banks will however be expected to pay closer attention to investment projects presented to them by the public in the event that i find this does not work i will have to take the necessary steps to correct the situation trade and balance of payments uganda has been experiencing a balance of payments difficulties for many years the country has experienced a large balance of payments deficits since 1m2 in 1982 the overall balance of payments deficit was us 32 9 million then the us 36 3 million in 1983 and us 58 5 million in 1984 after 1984 the situation deteriorated sharply mainly for two reasons the current account balance could not register any marked improvement due to economic conditions which discouraged the country s export trade and secondly the growing capital account deficit mainly stemming from large debt service payment especially those relating to the international monetary fund repurchases over the years 1989 and 1986 the government imposed sharp cut backs on imports except those which were absolutely essential for the functioning of the economy but even then the balance of payment deficit remained extremely adverse the government has taken steps to restore the country s balance of payment position by raising substantial soft term resources from abroad and also negotiated re scheduling of the country s external debts as i have pointed out earlier on as a result of this the government hopes to restore a sustainable balance of payments position in chiding a strong reserve position by encouraging exports of traditional and non traditional goods as well as import substitution mr chairman the newly established barter trade in the country will go a long way in assisting this country to diversify its exports following your personal efforts mr chairman uganda has recently identified large markets for uganda s products like timber soya beans hides and skins beans and fresh fruits to mention a few examples two large projects are already being financed by the use of the barter trade namely the bituminization of the mityana mubende fort portal road and the rehabilitation of the kampala international hotel given however the demands for the importation of equipment and spare parts for rehabilitating the industrial sector the need to import inputs in the agricultural sector and basic necessities for the population this year will require an exceptional balance of payments support but as the economy recovers and the production of goods in the domestic economy improves a favourable balance of payments should be restored by the end of the current investment programme produce prices on 15th may 1987 mr chairman you announced huge price increases in the producer prices of the controlled crops it is the policy of the nrm government to offer higher and higher prices for these commodities as a means of uplifting the well being of this country s producers of wealth the prices will be kept under constant review to ensure that the producer is adequately remunerated 1986 87 budgetary out turn mr chairman let me now turn to the budget out turn for the fiscal year ended the original estimates for recurrent expenditure for the financial year 1986 87 was shs 6 4 billion while development expenditure was estimated at shs 4 8 billion
the nrc hears a dramatic new programme for the economy founded on discipline and a new exchange rate following is the full text of the 1986 87 budget speech delivered by prof p s mulema at parliament building in kampala over the weekend domestic production the economy of uganda has been troubled for the last 15 years by economic mis management during the 1970s it was not even possible to assess the extent of this mismanagement in statistical terms because the entire administrative system had almost ceased to function even when the military government was overthrown in 1979 the economy could not recover because of the in security that prevailed misallocation of national resources and lack of guidance and direction between 1972 and 1979 the economic condi tions forced ugandans to move from production to commerce and services where these were possible during this period there fore little production for ex port took place although pro duction of coffee continued somewhat because of the nature of the crop while other exports like cotton suf fered from substitution effect when people switched to production of locally consumed commodities whose prices rose steadily in response to the declining value of the shilling this low level of pro duction both in agriculture and industry was reflected in the trends of gross domestic product it was however not possible to get reliable statistics such figures as we now have are rough estimates based on the few statistics available and lots of assump tions between 1978 and i960 was a further marked drop in gross domestic products as a result of the war that was taking place then and although gross domestic product recovered somewhat between 1980 and 1983 most of that recovery was accounted for by in creases in commerce and government services since even during that time production remained very low rough estimates indicate that real gross domestic pro duct declined by 14 per cent between 1978 and 1980 and while there was a re cowry of about 17 per cent between 1980 and 1983 gross domestic product further declined by 10 per cent between 1984 and 1985 during 1985 it is estimated that the gross domestic product fell by 5 5 per cent the monetary economy showed a decline of 3 9 per cent during the same period while non monetary could have declined by up to 8 per cent it is not possible to get accurate figures for the non monetary economy in the absence of detailed statistics the de cline in this sector could have been moderate or sub stantial but it can be assumed that as a result of massive smuggling that was going on along the borders the de cline in production in the peasant economy could have been more apparent than real government is making arrangements to have a crop census followed up with regular periodic reports compiled from down at the parish level to ensure better planning and forecasting in future because of political instability and the security which existed in 1985 it can reasonably be assumed that the output in both agriculture and manufacturing industries where these are in operation was not substantial certainly in the industrial sector the industries did not only lack funds to purchase raw materials and capital inputs but lacked working capital as well prices and monetary developments there have been very high increases in prices in this country between 1980 and now the reasons can be analysed in terms of supply and demand on the supply side the economy has faced problems in terms of the distribution of food and the production of manufactured items although uganda has the capacity to produce large quantities of commodities for export we have continued to face transport bottle necks and absence of appropriate marketing arrangements in the past fifteen years the problems have been aggravated by conditions of insecurity mainly created by the behaviour of governments in power themselves this made it difficult for food which could be produced in large quantities to reach the markets in the industrial sector the production of goods was always too small to meet domestic demand the reasons for this are clear the industries were poorly managed lacked working capital and could not get sufficient foreign exchange for raw materials inputs and spare parts the situation was made worse by the financial programme approved by the obote government and supported by the international monetary fund that programme was principally aimed at management of demand without doing much about supply the industrial sector therefore either stagnated or some industries simply stopped operations because currency devaluation which was the principal monetary instrument in this programme made it possible for industries to operate since the cost of imported raw materials and spare parts progressively increased without corresponding increases in these industries working it capital while the financial programme adopted concentrated on imports and consumption this did not substantially affect the internal price levels because considerable quantities of the consumer goods imported were either smuggled out of the country or foreign currency approved for such goods was diverted to other purposes abroad the result was that consumer goods such as shoes bedsheets blankets clothes sugar soap and others remained in short supply and therefore attracted very high prices on the other hand the financial programme failed even in this respect not withstanding its main pre occupation with demand management the governments were not particularly disciplined and therefore expansion in money supply to finance unplanned and in many cases irregular government spending the government deficit therefore continued to widen and the resultant inflation was particularly damaging to the economy especially as it was financed by borrowing from the banking system and the bank of uganda in particular in addition to growing government deficits to finance consumption and services a large proportion of bank credit went to finance commercial activity and speculation even where production was possible credit to finance it was not available in banks because there were more profitable ventures in commerce and speculation for banks to finance the financial institutions therefore ignored agriculture and industry because it did not pay as well this government is determined to reverse the trend some of the measures that have already been taken to correct this unhealthy situation include the recent setting up of the rehabilitation of productive enterprises programme which with supporting foreign resources supplied by the united states government will especially finance agriculture and agro related industries before the end of the year another organisation to be known as the uganda agricultural finance agency uafa will be set up with the single objective of financing agriculture government is also seriously considering increasing the capital of uganda development bank which is the national institution best suited to the financing needs of the industry in the monetary field domestic credit increased sharply between 1980 and 1985 the acceleration declined somewhat between 1982 and 1984 but during the year 1984 85 total domestic credit increased 130 per cent from shs 85 billion to shs 195 2 billion this went hand in hand with government indebtedness to the banking system net claims on government increased 65 per cent between 1983 and 1984 from shs 40 5 billion to shs 66 9 billion and increased further to shs 108 8 billion by the end of 1985 this increase largely reflected government dependence on bank financing to cover the widening budgetary deficit bank credit to the private sector was also increasing during the same period but at a lower rate of growth although this credit to the private sector went mainly to finance commerce money defined as currency in circulation and bank deposits increased by 90 per cent over the year 1985 from shs 1115 billion to shs 211 3 billion while currency in circulation alone nearly doubled during the same period from shs 43 9 billion to shs 80 7 billion this large increase in currency in circulation naturally put a lot of pressure on prices as these large increases were taking place during a period of low and declining production bank credit was also distributed in a manner that reflected the usual effects of inflation in an economy in agriculture for instance bank lending stood at shs 35 3 billion by the middle of 1985 and rose to shs 48 1 billion by the end of the year these fairly large increases in the agricultural area are largely explained by financing export crops and in particular coffee commercial bank credit to agriculture for purposes of production remained virtually non existent in a situation of inflation the attitude of commercial banks can be justified on purely financial grounds it was more rational for banks to finance sectors where credit was relatively more secure and where it could be recovered in a short period these were mainly commercial and services ventures the manufacturing sector received very little credit from banks especially as most of the industries were bogged down with legal problems stemming from ownership and other problems frequent evaluation of the shilling did not help either monetary policy the policy employed by the previous governments while aimed at establishing a relatively more acceptable exchange rate tor he shilling had the effect of undermining this very policy the exchange rate policy was used by the previous governments as an instrument to help in the management of demand the idea was to devalue the shilling and thus make the foreign currency more expensive in terms of uganda shilling and therefore reduce the demand for it management of demand can only succeed if first there is discipline in how money is spent not just in government but also in those institutions which are charged with the management of financial resources and where there is a mechanism for channelling resources into productive areas of the economy what went wrong in uganda was that budgetary discipline was lacking and those who advocated the monetary approach to the management of the economy depended on the market mechanism to orient the economy towards more production and less consumption that of course could not happen because of the internal contradictions inherent in the policy the government intends to maintain a fixed exchange rate in order to minimise inflation but will also take other measures that will help the economy to recover stably without high rates of inflation the government has therefore decided that the exchange rate be fixed at shs 1400 per us dollar with immediate effect the dual exchange rate regime is abolished interest rates of course do play a monetary role as they do regulate the cost and availability of credit and where it goes they also can help in mobilising financial resources which could be used to achieve desired economic objectives in a situation of inflation however interest rates need to be substantially high in order to attract people to save and also discourage some from speculation through reluctance to hold money or through hoarding and property dealings high rates of interest however can have very damaging effects on an economy they could discourage borrowing and in a situation like ours may have the effect of curtailing production since production forces the investors to tie money in projects for a relatively long period if the rates of interest are high such borrowing may appear rightly or wrongly unacceptable to producers the subject is therefore controversial it has therefore been decided that as soon as the national investment plan is approved and therefore the desired levels of investment in the various sectors are established interest rates policy will be reviewed financial institutions will be required to adjust their investment portfolios and ensure that predetermined proportions of their lending go to each sector of the economy at that juncture it will be possible to reduce interest rates applicable to productive sectors without at the same time discouraging lending institutions from lending to these low interest sectors the most significant development in the area of monetary policy to be undertaken during the current fiscal year is the currency reform which i announced earlier this year new currency notes are already being manufactured by our security printers the minting of new coins is also in progress for we shall definitely go back to the use of cents and shillings coins as valuable media of exchange the production of high security currency takes a longer time than most people appear to realise it is only this factor that is delaying the exercise trade and balance of payments the economic mismanagement of this country has experienced in the past has had the effect of narrowing our export base so much that at present the only export we can seriously talk about is coffee the country would probably have no export at the moment if coffee were not the type of crop can survive long periods of neglect even then the volume of coffee exports has been declining in the last ten years while other export crops like cotton and tea already show promising signs of recovery the country will not expect substantial earnings from these crops this year coffee exports amounted to 143 000 tonnes in1979 and declined to a level of 133 000 tonnes in 1984 and increased again somewhat to 151 500 tonnes in 1985 the decline in coffee production may however not reflect the true situation a lot of uganda coffee has systematically been smuggled out of the country by both individuals and it would appear official agencies cotton tea and tobacco continue to be exported but in quantities that do not demand any particular mention here in 1982 however maize appeared for the first time as one of uganda s exports which reached a level of 30 000 tonnes in 1983 and declined substantially in 1985 to a level of 9 800 tonnes unit prices of our exports continued to fluctuate from time to time in response to forces beyond the control of the developing world although international agreements under the international coffee organisation have helped a great deal in bringing about relative stability in coffee prices on the world market the value of uganda s total exports reached a level of us 380 million in 1985 nearly all these consist of earnings from coffee uganda s imports in 1983 1984 and 1985 were valued at the us 428 million us 342 and the us 264 million respectively this drop reflected the country s growing inability to raise enough currency to finance imports as well as political difficulties which existed during 1985 drawings from imf were getting exhausted by 1984 and because the financial programme with the fund was not renewed uganda s capacity to import was severely constrained the country experienced substantial trade deficits between 1980 and 1982 although by 1985 we had recorded a surplus in the trade balance largely because imports had been disrupted by political and military problems the country was experiencing on the capital account uganda utilised substantial capital and by 1983 we had recorded a substantial surplus of us 27 million this improvement reflected substantial use of borrowed resources particularly from the imf uganda therefore had relied largely on external financing to finance imports however repurchases from the imf that is to say repayment of our debt was already in excess of our drawings from the fund by up to the us 10 million by 1984 thus marking the beginning of the balance of payments difficulties which the country faces at the present time the international economic scene on the international scene uganda has like other countries witnessed recent sharp decreases in oil prices this decline could have benefited the developing countries greatly however we do not control the oil market and have to rely on the operations of the commercial organisations which market that oil worldwide uganda has yet to get the full benefit of low oil prices while the effect of cheaper oil is expected to be positive and lead to higher rates of growth in the developed countries this cannot necessarily be said of developing nations the developing world is constantly faced with two major problems the first is the currency fluctuations which frequently affect the balance of payments positions and the second is fluctuations in prices of their exports in regard to this latter problem it is noteworthy that over the last few months the price of coffee on the world markets has dropped by as much as a dollar per kilogramme this has considerably depressed our foreign earnings furthermore the developing world including uganda continues to be a net exporter of capital to the developed world this phenomenon continues even at this time these flows consist of the transfer of capital by commercial undertakings and investors who operate in the developing world as well as flows on account of principal and interest on various credits raised in the developed countries producer prices for controlled commodities in may this year the government announced substantial increases in the prices paid to farmers for controlled export crops it is the policy of this government to offer higher and higher prices for these commodities as a means of providing an incentive for greater production as well as redressing the imbalance between the rural and the urban sectors of the economy however because of the current condition in the international commodity markets it is impossible for the government to review upwards the prices currently payable to producers as suggested above with regards to world prices for coffee the government is only making an effort to maintain prices to the farmer at the level at which they are now price increases are therefore impossible in the circumstances however the government will continue the policy of offering the best possible prices in light of world market conditions the price for cotton in particular will be reviewed before the commencement of the coming season development programme the government is in the process of formulating an investment programme which will reflect the economic policies of the nrm government the programme will not only focus its main attention on production but it will also put emphasis on developing an integrated economy so that the economy is oriented to produce as much as possible those commodities goods or equipment that will enable productive sectors especially industry and agriculture to support each other when industries begin to operate at higher capacities uganda should produce more of its basic needs within the country the investment programme is in the final stage of discussion and when it is published it will indicate broadly what ugandans plan to do for themselves and the nature of assistance they expect from financial organisations and friendly countries this budget cannot of course take into account the full and final recommendations of the investment programme although during this financial year certain projects in the programme may be started this will include the rehabilitation of our roads as well as some industrial projects which the government considers to be urgently required even before the investment plan is released the government is already implementing those policies that are fundamental to its economic policy uganda intends to depend on its own resources as much as possible in developing its economy in this connection we will primarily use our foreign currency to a pay for petroleum products as well as drugs both human and animals b purchase raw materials and capital inputs to produce those consumer goods which the people need as well as agricultural inputs to promote more production for local consumption and export c purchase capital goods and transport equipment the country cannot at the moment produce and d pay for consumer goods which our industries could produce but cannot now due to mismanagement and neglect e pay for scholastic materials needed in our educational institutions and f repay the country s external debts most which could have been avoided the government has also embarked on measures which are aimed at reducing demands on our foreign exchange resources we have already reached agreements with a number of countries under which we will exchange commodities or goods with each other so that the need for use of convertible currencies is reduced in this regard the government is launching an export drive involving non traditional exports such as maize beans timber hides and skins simsim and soya beans government calls upon all persons to re double their efforts in the production of these commodities and guarantees a sure market to the producers at competitive prices in addition the government intends to restrict external borrowing to the financing of development projects where the capital investment is such that we cannot finance them from our own resources foreign investment the investment programme will make allowances for and encourage investment by investors abroad a law exists to protect such investment as well as give incentives to those who wish to invest in uganda the foreign investment protection act 1964 and the subsequent decree of 1977 give details of what the investors need to do before they start on their projects in uganda that law provides for a committee of senior officers who are supposed to examine the nature of the proposed investment and determine whether it is in line with the country s development objectives if the committee is satisfied it makes a recommendation to the minister of finance who signs a certificate of approved status thus allowing the investor the right to remit dividends and interest on any money he might have borrowed from abroad to finance the project in the country it should be emphasized however that each project has to be discussed with the government on a case by case basis to ensure that its future operations are in line with the government s economic objectives and will produce those goods or services the country considers a priority departed asians property custodian board the government has already started on work relating to the final resolution of issues relating to properties left behind by departed asians we are at the moment examining the law governing their sale or return to the former owners as it stands amendments to the law may be necessary new legislation may also be necessary say with regards to land tenure to provide for certain modes of sale and ownership that cannot be accommodated m the existing law a task force consisting of lawyers experts on urban affairs bankers and others is currently examining the necessary procedures and modalities to be followed their recommendations will be submitted to the government for a final decision after this process properties as shall be a candidate for sale shall be valued and disposed of recommendations are also expected from the task force on the best ways of deploying and utilising the proceeds from these sales 1985 86 budgetary out turn the budgetary situation during the year 1985 86 was abnormally difficult the budgetary performance was more absurd than ever before the original estimates for recurrent expenditure for the financial year 1985 86 were shs 213 0 billion while development expenditure was estimated at shs 144 6 billion in the course of the year these figures were revised by supplementary estimates to shs 343 7 billion shs 170 6 billion for recurrent and development expenditure respectively giving a total expenditure of shs 514 3 billion on the revenue side the original estimates for the financial year 1985 86 were shs 240 8 billion for the recurrent tax revenue and shs 73 1 billion for development revenue in that order the revised tax revenue estimates for the year are shs 276 6 billion and shs 125 8 billion for recurrent and development respectively making a total of shs 402 5 billion as against the original estimates of shs 314 0 billion the out turn for 1985 86 budget therefore gives an overall deficit of shs 104 6 billion many factors made it very difficult in some cases impossible to live within the original budgeted amounts and consequently necessitated revision of expenditure estimates by supplementary provisions the main factors were first government services which were not originally catered for in the budget namely provision of emergency relief for the people in the war ravaged areas especially luwero triangle arua moyo moroto and kotido implementation of government policy to provide free education in the luwero triangle arua moyo and the two districts of karamoja second increased salaries and wages due to either underestimation of police and prison requirements in the original budget or increase in the number of soldiers in the ministry of defence in the course of the year and an upward revision of their salaries in the second half of the year and in addition the government had to acquire new equipment and transport facilities for the army i e uniforms mattresses vehicles etc third the continued depreciation of the shilling which affected a number of payments made in foreign currency e g external loan servicing remittance to our missions abroad students allowances overseas overseas purchases and contributions to international organisations as well as travel abroad fourth internally the cost of maintenance and feeding a soldiers and police and prisons personnel as well as inmates b students in secondary schools colleges and makerere university and c hospital patients and paramedics constantly increased fifth the rate of revenue collection was far less than the rate of expenditure as indicated by expenditure demand of ministries and departments details of the out turn of 1985 86 tax and development revenues and external grants and loans are in the financial statements and revenue estimates published today 1986 87 budget forecast the main policy objective of the 1985 86 budget will focus on financing and re habilitating government services that have been neglected as far as recurrent budget is concerned and repair of many state assets that have been damaged during the recent wars these include buildings in government institutions schools hospitals roads machinery etc as regards development budget the budget will also lay emphasis on providing means of livelihood to the population in the war affected areas under the ministry of rehabilitation in the 1986 87 budget the overall revenue including foreign grants among others are forecast to increase by about 90 per cent whereas the overall expenditure is expected to increase by about 119 per cent the total estimates of revenue published today in the financial statement is shs 777 8 billion tax revenue is estimated at shs 487 3 billion appropriation in aid is estimated at shs 16 8 billion development revenue is expected to be shs 273 7 billion from the following sources a dividends from government owned companies or companies in which government has shares shs 4 1 billion b ida i and ii and other projects accounts which should realise shs 56 5 billion c kenya compensation fund expected to contribute shs 40 6 billion d sale of buses proceeds should bring shs 4 4billion e external grant estimated to bring shs 72 3billion and f external loans proceeds should bring shs 95 8 billion the total estimates of expenditure are budgeted as shs 1 127 5 billion recurrent expenditure is estimated at shs 509 billion statutory recurrent is budgeted at shs 134 0 billion development expenditure is estimated at shs 474 1 billion statutory development is estimated at shs 9 8 billion the total revenue and the total expenditure give a deficit of shs 349 7 billion this is to be financed from borrowing from the banking system and also from non bank sources subject to the government decision part of the proceeds from the sale of custodian board properties may be applied to the financing of this deficit most of the parastatal bodies continue to depend on government assistance for their operations government s proposed contribution to various parastatal bodies amounting to shs 22 7 billion is included under the ministry of finance development budget out of this amount shs 7 0 billion is to cater for partial capitalisation of the uganda airlines while shs 9 5 billion goes towards udc s share capital this government places a lot of emphasis on discipline within government and the way public funds are handled this emphasis is necessary because rehabilitation needs in this country at the moment are pressing many that is the reason why the budget deficit is so large the treasury will therefore place strict controls on the use of funds by a releasing the money to ministries for only real needs which should be properly documented b reducing the number and size of government delegations travelling abroad and in many cases request our embassies abroad to attend meetings where uganda will be required without sending officers from kampala c insisting on proper authority before purchases can be financed with public funds d ensuring that each ministry spends money in amounts not exceeding those provided in the budget to be authorised today as a result of high rates of inflation over the last ten years real wages and salaries are at the moment very low indeed at the lowest level the monthly wage is no even enough to buy a bunch of matoke or five kilogrammes of maize flour the government has therefore decided to increase the total wages bill of government by 50 per cent and provide for this increase in individual scales in such a way that the 50 per cent increase in total wages and salaries will range from token increases at the top scale to more than 50 per cent increase at the bottom scale this will of course not bring significant relief to the workers as the prices will dill be high for all of them the government however intends to take further measures in the near future to bring about a happier balance between goods and services on the market and aggregate demand more meaningful salary increases will only be possible when our production levels and the tax base expand and when the government has trimmed down the establishment where excessive staffing exists taxation proposals i now wish to turn to the taxation proposals these proposals have the following objectives i guaranteeing a constant continuous and adequate flow of revenue in the prevailing circumstances ii stimulating production the above objectives will be achieved through the following measures a revision of the various tax rates in order to bring them in line with the present rate of inflation some of these rates have been revised for over a decade now and are meaningless compared to the cost and importance of the services they are purportedly paid for b increasing the vigilance surveillance and therefore effectiveness of the tax administrators c a liberal application of fiscal policy to ensure the flow of inputs in both the agricultural and industrial sectors at relatively low prices these measures will form the basis for long term tax policy objectives income tax the finance act 1982 changed the appellate system by replacing the local committees and the tribunal with the commissioner for appeals but since then it has not been possible to establish the new system the reason being the difficulty of identifying a person conversant with this new system in the meantime however objections have been piling up thus holding up the tax that should have been collected i should on the other hand emphasize that an appellate system is an integral part of effective tax administration and is instrumental in promoting compliance consequently to save time and to speed up resolution of disputes and therefore realise the revenue i propose to revert to the old system of the local committees and also do away with the tribunal in a free enterprise society it is the business sector which determines the level of investment increasing the rate of investment is important for capital formation and therefore the rate of economic growth to be able to increase savings and therefore the rate of investment i propose to reduce the rate of corporation tax applicable to industry and agriculture from 50 per cent to 40 per cent however in order for a business to make an adequate contribution to the reconstruction effort i propose to raise the corporation tax applicable to commercial banks arid other financial institutions other than insurance companies from the present level of 50 per cent to 60 per cent the rate for insurance companies will remain at the current level i also propose to raise all other corporation tax outside industry and agriculture to 60 per cent presumptive income tax assessment popularly known as income tax deposits was introduced in 1976 since then it has been extended to various economic activities with a view to tapping all sources of incomes in its current circumstances the department of income tax is thin on the ground and constrained by transport and therefore unable to effectively reach every potential tax payer therefore as recommended in the uganda economy study report in the near future we shall have to depend increasingly on presumptive assessments to collect the revenue in order to increase the contribution of income tax to total revenue i propose to double the current deposit rates applicable to commercial activity and adjust others appropriately the details will be found in the finance decree as a result of this measure i expect to realise shs 15 0 billion in the budget speech last year a new incentive scheme for commercial banks intended to encourage them to spread banking facilities to the rural areas was announced i e if any commercial bank opened i one branch it would be entitled to a reduction in income tax of 30 per cent ii if two branches 60 per cent iii if three branches 100 per cent it is now felt that this was too generous and commercial banks could use the scheme to continuously avoid payment of income tax starting with the year of income 1987 this rebate will be discontinued in the present financial circumstances alternative measures will be taken to ensure the expansion of bank networks these measures will become effective on january 1 1987 customs duty the only substantive amendment is in respect of section 117a 2 of the east african customs transfer management act in order to discourage the public to hold on to government revenue i propose that the interest rate payable on any outstanding tax be the ruling commercial bank lending rate applicable to commerce but in the course of administering the customs law certain measures were adopted administratively one such measure is the requirement for pre payment of taxes on imports i have carefully assessed the effect of pre payment on our imports and their prices and decided to do away with this requirement immediately it has already been announced import duty rates for petroleum products have gone up to super 100 per cent regular 100 per cent kerosene 50 per cent and the rate on diesel is 20 per cent these and the proposed sales tax rates result in the following pump prices super shs 1 100 per litre regular shs 1 000 per litre kerosene shs 750 per litre and diesel shs 500 per litre in the case of beer the import duty has gone up to 200 per cent the nrm government has demonstrated serious concern for the welfare of the people by ensuring that the little that there is is shared equitably in this case the government can proudly state that with the assistance of the resistance committees sugar has reached every household at a manageable price but the government is battling with the problem of ensuring the supply of essential commodities at reasonable prices on the one hand and the need to generate additional revenue in order to continue rendering services to the country on the other in order to generate additional revenue i propose to raise the import duty and sales tax on sugar to 30 per cent and 40 per cent respectively as a result of this proposal the retail price for sugar will be about shs 1 600 per kilogramme in addition there are technical amendments which will i incorporate pta rates in our customs tariff ii streamline the tariffs in respect of motor vehicles to accommodate four wheel drive vehicles special liquid transport vehicles and dumpers iii streamline tariff rates where finished products are tax free and yet inputs to manufacture them locally are taxable or where both the components and the finished goods are liable to the same rate of duty as a result of these measures i expect to raise shs 37 0 billion sales tax with effect from midnight tonight the following rates of sales tax will apply 1 beer 30 per cent 2 cigarettes i kali 20 per cent ii others 30 per cent 3 petroleum products a super and regular 50 per cent b kerosene 30 per cert other technical amendments will be found in the finance decree as a result of these measures i estimate to raise shs 54 4 billion excise duty the following rates will be applicable from midnight tonight i beer 50 per cent ii cigarettes a kali 40 per cent b others 60 per cent since 1981 82 excise duty on sugar has been suspended because there was no local production i intend to continue with the suspension until local production starts but i propose to re impose excise duty at the rate of 30 per cent on uganda waragi i expect to raise shs 29 0 billion from these measures licences the present level of fees and licences charged under the traffic and road safety act 1970 neither reflects the cost of administration nor the importance of the service paid for i have therefore decided to substantially increase them so as to fully reflect these two the details of the increases will be found in the finance decree as a result of this measure i hope to real se shs 7 0 billion including sir 1 2 billion from the commission on import licences hitherto collected by the advisory board of trade this measure takes immediate effect stamp duty the stamp duty rates were last revised in 1967 the developments in the economy since then have rendered them worthless yet the instruments for which stamp duty is paid are important to offer or guarantee legal security or protection to bring these rates up to date i have decided as follows 1 where value can be ascertained the rate will be 5 per cent of the value of the instrument in respect of which stamp duty is levied 2 where this is not possible as in the case of an affidavit the present rate will be increased 300 times in partial reflection of the decline in the value of the shilling since then this measure again takes effect immediately airport tax with immediate effect i propose to raise the fee payable by a passenger leaving the country to the us 10 per passenger this will bring our charge in line with other international airports in the neighbouring countries nonresidents will pay in dollars but residents will pay the equivalent in uganda shillings with immediate effect foreign registered vehicles entering uganda will be required to pay the us 150 in hard currency i would also like to report that i am contemplating the introduction of a road user tax in order to make all road users contribute to the rehabilitation and maintenance of our roads besides raising adequate revenue necessary to minimise financing the budget by re sorting to ways and means advances from the bank of uganda i intend to use fiscal policy to encourage both investment and production the long term objective of this policy is to build a strong tax base so as to realise more revenue i shall therefore on a selective basis consider allowing the importation into uganda of industrial and agricultural inputs tax free the additional taxation measures i have outlined above are expected to realise additional revenue amounting to shs 148 9 billion other measures which will come into effect in the course of the fiscal year are the following i mulago hospital is to become a self accounting organisation this is intended to speed up disbursements to the hospital as well as payment to hospital suppliers and creditors ii similar arrangements being worked out in respect of makerere university iii a motor third party insurance law is currently being drafted to protect both road users and motorists iv it is proposed to set up a uganda re insurance corporation as a vehicle of development financing as well as an organ to assist the financing of budget deficits v ugandans who have legitimately earned income outside the country will in future be allowed to open external accounts in hard currencies arrangements are underway in the bank of uganda for the implementation of this decision vi in future all registered exporters of various commodities will be allowed to open external accounts in which they will be allowed to deposit 20 per cent of their external earnings in hard currencies finally vii in order to preserve foreign exchange and to reduce over invoicing all future cash imports shall be on a c f basis only the insurance to cover such imports shall be provided by uganda insurance companies under the auspices of the national insurance corporation all these measures are designed to streamline operations of government and make for better management of the economy and the good of its citizens

the minister of finance mr gerald ssendaula yesterday presented his budget proposal for fiscal 2002 3 to parliament following is the full text of his speech theme increased production for increased exports and the eradication of absolute poverty mr speaker i beg to move that parliament do resolve itself into a committee of supply for the consideration and approval of the revised revenue and expenditure estimates for the fiscal year 2001 2002 and the budgetary proposals for the estimates of revenue and expenditure for the fiscal year 2002 2003 introduction mr speaker under article 155 1 of the constitution the president shall cause to be prepared and laid before parliament estimates of revenue and expenditure for each financial year i am accordingly performing the duty on behalf of the president let me take this opportunity to congratulate you and all the honorable members of parliament on your election to represent the people in this august house you will recall that this current budget was presented before the parliamentary elections were completed my ministry has had a very fruitful working relationship with parliament particularly in the operationalisation of the budget act 2001 the budget i am presenting gives a report on what has been achieved in the first year of the five year term of the president and what the government intends to do in the second year to enhance the implementation of the president s manifesto the overriding goal is to make uganda secure for lives and property and a safe base for public and private sector investments and to promote rapid export led growth with the objective of reducing absolute poverty therefore the theme for this year s budget is increased production for increased exports and the eradication of absolute poverty performance of the economy the implementation of sound economic policies and reforms and the maintenance of macro economic stability have been key to ensuring the success we have achieved over the last decade this success is demonstrated in the strong growth in our gdp the low and steady inflation the increased per capita incomes marked decline in the incidence of poverty and the adequate levels of foreign currency reserves it is imperative that we continue with the same economic policies including a disciplined fiscal policy this means planning government spending within predictable and available resources redoubling efforts to produce and export wore and ensuring that the expenditure that we undertake provides value for money and produces benefits that can be equitably shared by all ugandans gross domestic product gdp growth 7 real gdp growth this year is estimated at 5 6 percent it is worth noting that most parts of the world have suffered recession or slow growth over the last year yet uganda has been able to sustain strong growth despite the continued weakness in the prices of our main export coffee economic growth has been evenly balanced across agriculture industry and services high rates of increase are recorded in tobacco cotton sugar food crops communication and education services 8 next year we are projecting real gdp to grow by 6 6 percent but our medium term objective is to restore gdp growth to 7 percent per annum to achieve this objective the government will maintain macroeconomic stability and will deepen and accelerate reforms aimed at removing bottlenecks to production at all levels inflation 9 consumer price inflation has remained low for most of the year the annual headline inflation rate which include food crop prices was actually negative for most of the fiscal year because of a steep fall in food crop prices as a result of good weather conditions the outturn for underlying inflation which excludes food crops is projected at 3 5 percent exports 10 this year total exports are projected at us 450m and remittances from abroad at 540m unfortunately while coffee exports have increased by 6 7 percent the value declined by 23 percent due to a 30 percent drop in the international price of this major export crop costing uganda about us 30m in lost export earnings due to the vigorous policy on export diversification initiated by this government the strong performance on non coffee exports is gradually making up for the lost coffee earnings for example this year the non coffee exports have provided us 372m medium term economic and budget strategy 11 mr speaker the four pillars of the peap are the foundations that support our medium term economic and budget strategy i will now turn to the key strategies and issues that underpin the budget for the medium term moving us closer to achieving the goals of the poverty eradication action plan peap you will recall that we have identified the four pillars of this plan to be i creating a framework for rapid economic growth and structural transformation ii insuring security and good governance iii measures to increase the incomes of the poor and iv measures to increase the quality of life of the poor production for export 12 one of the highest priorities for the medium term is to increase exports in support of rapid economic growth and structural transformation this will require significant expansion of production diversification quality control and adding of value to export products and instilling the value of savings in our people as an important base for domestic investments the principal government programs supporting exports are the medium term competitiveness strategy mtcs the plan for modernisation of agriculture pma and the strategic exports program 13 to achieve our export drive objectives concerted efforts on all fronts and the cooperation of all stakeholders including our development partners is critical our partners have already given signs of support for this objective through specific trade initiatives including the european union s everything but arms eba the united states africa growth and opportunities act agoa and the recent trade agreements concluded with japan unfortunately there are worrying signs of halfhearted commitments for these initiatives on the part of some of our partners as illustrated by increased subsidies to the very products we are capable of producing and exporting 14 government is also exploring how to effectively attract large pioneer investments in strategic areas of great export and import substitution potential and how to survive and take advantage of all the possible opportunities in the international markets we will continue the dialogue with all stakeholders including parliament and development partners and ensure that the momentum already built for attracting investors is not dampened improving improving budgetary efficiency and effectiveness i5 mr speaker we are committed to improve fiscal discipline at the budget planning and execution stages these involve following key undertakings i reduction of supplementaries to only emergencies ii reduction of domestic arrears through commitment control iii strengthening financial management iv pay and procurement reform v strengthening fiscal decentralization and vi strengthening monitoring and evaluation i shall now expand on all these elements strengthening financial management 16 mr speaker the public finance and accountability bill 2002 was recently approved by cabinet and is due to be considered by parliament when enacted into law it will replace the 1964 public finance act taking into account the 1995 constitution a major feature is a requirement that all proposed supplementary expenditure must be approved by parliament prior to the release of funds i am confident that parliament will fully support this bill which provides for greater control over the implementation of the budget by this august house 17 to support the implementation of the public finance and accountability bill government has started an extensive training program for accounting and financial management staff in central and local governments and in the office of the auditor general in addition a strong team of professional accountants and auditors has been recruited to support the entire program for strengthening financial management in government 18 the new integrated financial management system is to be introduced to enable government to more efficiently plan and execute the budget and account for all financial activities the design phase was recently completed and he pilot phase of the system is planned to start on 1st july 2003 extension to all ministries and local governments will take place over a number of years this is a very significant step and must have the full cooperation of all the technical and political level stakeholders an integral part of the integrated financial management system is a new budgetary classification system incorporating international best practice in public sector accounting this will be introduced at the beginning of the next budgetary cycle commitment control and arrears reduction 19 the commitment control system ccs has continued to assist in the reduction but not the elimination of the accumulation of domestic arrears since some accounting officers are not operating within the financial resources availed to them as a result during fy 2002 03 we will focus our attention on the defaulting ministries and their accounting officers to ensure that they comply fully with the ccs and take full responsibility for all the arrears created 20 the effective fight against arrears requires reliable data to identify the causes of arrears and those creating them in this regard i am very concerned that suppliers are not responding to my calls to cease supplying extended credit outside the commitment control system 21 continued accumulation of arrears to utility companies is a shared liability between government departments and utility companies mainly due to failure to bill accurately and regularly and to collect promptly in order to resolve this issue effective 1st august 2002 government shall commence release of funds for telephone and water services on a prepayment basis against the approved budget therefore from 1st july all accounting officers are requested to reconcile their accounts with the utility companies prior to introducing the new system 22 salary and pension arrears especially those under local government plus court awards remain a very serious problem and these will be the subjects of close scrutiny in the next financial year 23 mr speaker while it would not be prudent to predict zero new arrears by the end of fy 2002 03 this must nevertheless be our firm target it is a target that will only be achieved if all those involved including the business community play their part to stop accounting officers from over committing government arrears are a clear sign of budget indiscipline and are a serious and growing burden on the community general arrears of concern in public expenditure 24 h e the president concerned about the cost of public administration vis à vis other priorities a view shared by parliament commissioned a study on the cost of public administration the report of the study identifies possible areas of savings for possible reallocation to other peap priorities including comprehensive public service reform the government will in the near future announce how and when to implement the recommendations of this study fiscal decentralisation strategy 25 mr speaker in order to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the fiscal transfer system cabinet recently approved the fiscal decentralisation strategy this new strategy will provide a framework that will streamline the transfer of resources to local governments reduce and standardise the reports required halt the proliferation of bank accounts and the related bank charges and increase the flexibility with which local governments can spend their resources while maintaining a focus on national priorities in order to stimulate the local government revenue generating effort which has stagnated in recent years the new system will include incentives linking local revenue performance and autonomy in decision making with transfers from the centre the implementation of the fiscal decentralisation strategy is to be piloted in 15 local governments effective fy 2002 03 the census and the national planning authority 26 census enumeration will take place in september this year this is a very important exercise the result of which will be a completely updated baseline of socio economic data this will in turn provide the basis for our future plans and for updating the peap the census is divided into four modules household community agricultural and micro and small enterprises i urge all ugandans to support this exercise it is intended that the exercise of registration of birth and deaths which is covered by an act of parliament will be reactivated to ensure continuous provision of essential data and statistics for national planning 27 the long awaited national planning authority will commence its operations during the next financial year 2002 03 the data provided by the census will obviously be invaluable for the work of the npa in guiding the long term development plan and strategies budget achievements for fy 2001 2 and planned outputs for fy 2002 3 28 i now wish to turn to achievements in fy 2001 02 and to highlight the major planned activities and expected outputs for the next financial year i will do this using the framework of the four pillars of the poverty eradication action plan peap pillar 1 creating a framework for rapid economic growth and structural transformation promoting strategic exports 29 mr speaker as i intimated in my budget speech last year the government has developed a five year strategy to promote the production processing and marketing of a number of strategic exports to form a basis for faster and broader economic growth these areas include coffee cotton textiles tea fish beef hides and skins horticulture products and information and communications technology ict these interventions will have multiplier effects in the economy by removing structural bottlenecks to production storage and marketing 30 in developing this strategy government has been careful to ensure that it not only represents an efficient use of resources but also that the interventions compliment the activities of the private sector sector specific studies were commissioned in each of the identified areas and a final report was produced and discussed by all the stakeholders to enhance dialogue on the priority activities specific interventions and the timing of such activities 31 the bleak world markets for traditional exports have not only necessitated the need for strengthening the export base through diversification but also to ensure that uganda s products are competitive in the global market under this initiative the focus is on the following strategic components institutional capacity formulating and enforcing policies standards and regulations provision of critical equipment improving infrastructure for trading in commodities such as maize beans rice and ground nuts and producing high quality and competitive products particularly textiles and garments for the export market in addition we are undertaking investments in an information and communications technology ict incubation centre for enhancing ict related export earnings and supporting petroleum exploration and mining these interventions will boost export earnings significantly from the current level 32 in the current financial year a total of shs 52 5b was provided to support the above strategic export program sep and we intend to provide the same amount hi the next financial year 33 government interventions in these areas have enabled thousands of poor households to access planting and stock materials for coffee tea cotton and cocoa during fy 2001 2002 enhancing their capacity to generate incomes and diversify their livelihoods specifically distribution has been made of 16 5 million coffee seedlings to 85 000 households 1 1 million cocoa seedlings to 2 933 households two million tea seedlings to 1 000 households and five coffee nurseries have been established 34 government interventions in the tea sub sector were intended to increase the volumes and value of tea exports through increased acreage the importation of unproved tea clones for multiplication and distribution of seedlings to poor households the revival of tea research and the development of a tea policy framework 35 in the cotton sub sector production increased to 15 000 bales last season value addition through the production of textiles and garments for the export market and indeed for the local market is a major area being promoted with the introduction of block farming in the medium term targeting large scale commercial production higher cotton production is expected 36 the horticultural sector is one of the fastest growing export sectors in uganda rising in value from us 2 3m in 1995 to us 10 9m in 2001 with volumes tripling over the same period exports of vanilla have been boosted by the present high world prices maintaining quality is essential if our farmers are to continue to benefit from this buoyant market 37 improvements in infrastructure and the provision of fish fry have contributed to the continued good performance of the fish industry taking advantage of the lifting of the ban on fish exports to the european union the interventions aim at increasing production export volumes and values and restoring confidence in the safety and quality of uganda s fish and fish products fish exports for 2001 02 are projected to earn us 78 5m a substantial increase over the previous year 38 in the current financial year the uganda development bank was capitalised to the tune of shs5 7b furthermore an arrangement has been made with the development finance company of uganda to enable farmers to access affordable capital for purchasing machinery and equipment for agricultural production and processing in addition in april this year the sino uganda beijing chenoa company bcc a joint venture between uganda coffee development authority ucda and the beijing north star industrial group opened a coffee shop in china to promote uganda s crane coffee interventions in the ict sector will generate earnings for services being provided through call centres and data entry and processing services with north american companies 39 the uganda national council for science and technology is developing initiatives aimed at practical application of indigenous knowledge with the aim of adding value and commercialising it this is a very worthy endeavor and i propose to support it next financial year by establishing an innovation fund to be managed by the uganda council for science and technology 40 more details on the activities initiated this year under the strategic exports program are provided in the background to the budget strengthening the financial sector 41 for the economy to sustain high rates of investment over the long term our domestic savings rate must rise reducing our fiscal deficit will help to raise the savings rate but we should also encourage the mobilisation of private savings through pension reform a consensus has been reached among stakeholders that the pensions industry should be liberalised to allow reputable and well capitalised private sector pension providers to offer their services to the ugandan public this will both stimulate private savings and boost the capital market in uganda as the funds mobilised by pension providers will be available for investment in long term securities to protect the public liberalization of the pensions industry will proceed gradually and will be accompanied by the development of a regulatory structure for the industry nssf will still have an important role to play but the monopoly of nssf must be removed if there is to be genuine competition and reform of the pensions industry 42 as a further effort to strengthen capital markets in uganda effective july 2002 government through bank of uganda will introduce a long term bond of three to five years for monetary policy purposes accordingly i am proposing an amendment to the treasury bill act to provide for this new instrument the details of this amendment are contained in the finance bill 43 starting in august the bank of baroda will float 20 percent of its equity on the uganda stock exchange in line with the privatisation agreement reached with government this will give a timely boost activity in the capital market and provide another opportunity for the uganda public to participate in the future success of private enterprise in this country privatisation and utility reform 44 mr speaker the program of privatisation has continued and as of june 2002 110 divestitures of public enterprises will have been concluded leaving a further 40 to be divested it is worthwhile to note that through divestiture government has reduced overall subsidies to public enterprises from sh208b in 1994 to sh80b in 2000 01 reports on divestiture activities will continue to be submitted to this parliament as provided for by the relevant law 45 this year an independent power regulator the electricity regulatory authority was fully operationalised the concessioning of uganda electricity generation company limited and uganda electricity distribution company limited to private investors which commenced this year will be concluded next fiscal year this is essential to the reform of the power sector and vital for the modernisation of our economy 46 government intends to concession out the rail operations of urc s successor company by the end of 2003 the preparation for private sector participation in water service delivery in urban towns is in process it is expected that water systems in 33 large urban towns will be privatised under an operating lease electrification 47 remedial works on owen falls dam were concluded this financial year at a cost of sh 7b work started on the third unit at the kiira power plant adding 40 mw to the national grid upon completion funding for the fourth and fifth units was secured enabling

service has issued a circular restraining the districts from recruiting until after the completion of the ongoing restructuring exercise 65 with regard to the provision for the payment of wage arrears during 2002 03 in the absence of verified information from the ministry of public service the budget for arrears will be based on the performance of the wage arrears during 2001 02 66 a recent study on civil service pension reform has recommended a higher annual budget provision for future pension liabilities and a downward adjustment of the formulae for computing these obligations under the present system the government s future pension liabilities are completely unaffordable and thus we must commit ourselves to implementing the necessary reforms to make them affordable procurement reform 67 an important aspect of administrative reform has been the area of government procurement responsibility for public procurement was decentralized to line ministries in fy 2000 01 with the reformed central tender board undertaking a supervisory and regulatory role following the formulation of procurement regulations in fy 2000 01 a public procurement and disposal of public assets bill was prepared this year and is now before parliament major issues that are being addressed are the training of procurement staff and the staffing of procurement units in line ministries given the wide activities under this reform including capacity building i have provided a budget of sh5 3b to fund procurement reform next financial year peap pillar 3 measures to increase the incomes of our people 68 increases in the incomes of our people will in the long term only come through the creation of jobs as a result of enhanced productivity and economic growth agricultural and rural development are vital and closely related and in this regard the plan for the modernisation of agriculture is a multi sectoral plan for increasing rural incomes i will now outline government interventions under the pma district urban and community access roads and waterways 69 an efficient transport system is critical for rural and agricultural development routine and periodic maintenance costing about sh50b has been carried out this year on the 30 000 km of district urban and community access roads in uganda and the same output is planned next year a strategy discussed at the recent roads conference is being prepared to address long term development needs in the water transport sub sector work on the building of the kalangala vessel will soon start navigable routes and landing sites will be surveyed and lighthouses will be installed on lake victoria agriculture 70 government interventions in support of agricultural development fall under the multi sectoral plan for the modernisation of agriculture and the strategic exports program during the current financial year sh4 4b was disbursed as non sectoral conditional grants to sub counties in 24 districts national agricultural advisory services naads implementation started this financial year n six districts support to the naaps program operations this year amounted to sh5b and will expand to sh12b as activities are initiated in a further eight districts uganda s research system and the strategic plan for narq have been revised with greater emphasis to be placed on a demand driven and decentralised approach to research water for agricultural production 71 during 2002 03 the budget will provide for the completion of 16 strategic dams valley tanks in kotido moroto and nakapiripiriti completion of 15 dams valley tanks in sembabule mbarara nakasongola eiboga mubende and ntungamo construction of 50 valley tanks countrywide and the rehabilitation of two old dams in kumi and mbarara districts respectively 72 in addition government will complete the designs of at least five dam sites countrywide report on test pumping of 20 high yielding boreholes in karamoja for windmill installation finally a feasibility study on livestock water supply systems in the north and north eastern uganda will be carried out rural energy 73 expansion of energy in rural areas will provide income opportunities and improve the quality of life accordingly government has initiated the energy for rural transformation program as part of this government is finalising the financing for the rural electrification fund which is expected to leverage us 375m of investment in electrification schemes over the next 10 years government has signed contracts this year with development partners for rural electrification which will induce investment in rural growth centres and in the development of renewable energy land natural resources and the environment 74 increased security of land tenure is an integral component of pma the recently completed 10 year land sector strategic plan lssp provides a framework for land resources management implementation will continue next financial year through the 18 land tribunals that have been operational since january the operations of district land boards that started this year finalisation of the national land and land use policies and guidelines for undertaking systematic demarcation modernisation of the land registry and finalisation of the design of the land information system the land fund will be piloted in the kibaale area before finalising the rules and regulations to fund these programs and activities i am providing a budget of sh9b next financial year 75 under forestry a total of sh1 4b has been budgeted for the national forest authority nfa once it is established the role of the nfa will be to manage central government forest reserves on an ecologically sustainable basis establishment of nfa and e forestry fund will follow the completion of the national forest plan and the enactment of the forest bill next financial year guidelines to prepare forest management plans will be developed and district government forest extension staff trained 76 the key success of nema s program has been the support to nine districts to develop their district environment action plans fifteen districts will be supported next year the work on the development of rules regulations and guidelines to ensure that environmental laws are effectively implemented will continue and the plans of 12 key government institutions be reviewed for their environmental impacts 77 implementation of the wetland sector strategic vim started this year at the local government level and local governments developed several wetland action plans i am allocating sh700m next year under paf this represents a 32 percent increase over this year and will support enhanced activities including community awareness campaigns and the finalisation of the national wetlands inventory peap pillar 4 measures to improve the quality of life of our people primary and post primary education 78 the provision of primary education is a key element in the improvement in the quality of life of the poor considerable success has been achieved in enhancing access to primary education with the pupil teacher ratio falling to 54 1 this year from 57 1 last year and the pupil classroom ratio falling to 92 1 from 98 1 last year notwithstanding an increase in enrolment to 7 2m pupils including enrolment in private primary schools of 1 1m pupils during 2001 02 114 835 teachers were on the payroll compared with 103 404 the previous year 79 development partners expressed considerable satisfaction at the progress in implementing upe during the april 2002 joint sector review an important performance indicator in this sector is the pupil teacher ratio which is targeted to fall further to 50 1 in 2002 03 the education standards agency was recently established to oversee the overall quality of primary and post primary education 80 the curriculum for primary education has been revised with the focus on agriculture and on life skills to enable students to better integrate into the work force in addition improved procurement has resulted in the reduction of the unit cost of school textbooks by half on average down to sh5000 per book this saving should ensure that our long term target of providing each pupil with a textbook will be achieved sooner than later 81 a development program is currently being finalised for the post primary education sector the main program this year was the construction of schools in 16 districts costing sh2 3b a budget of sh1 16b has been allocated for the construction of eight seed schools next year to cater for the projected increase in the number of secondary teachers mainly in grant aided schools the wage bill for secondary education has been raised by 29 4 percent to sh55b next year health 82 the health strategic plan hssp has continued to guide interventions for reducing morbidity and mortality from the largest causes of ill health in the population and to increase access to health services nation wide 83 a few key health indicators demonstrate considerable progress most notably the hiv aids prevalence rate which has fallen to 6 1 percent down from 6 9 percent in financial year 1999 00 immunisation rates continue to rise with dpt 3 coverage reaching 46 and plans are in place to introduce two additional vaccines more than 2 300 nursing assistants have been trained this year well above the target of 1 800 for the year ninety health centre iis out of a planned target of 100 have been constructed this year bringing the total number constructed so far to 210 84 however there is an urgent need to address the status of the critical health indicators of infant and maternal mortality which have remained stagnant for a number of years while it is recognised that full responsibility for this status does not lie entirely within the mandate of the health sector as other factors particularly education water sanitation and culture have a strong influence on health outcomes it is very clear that expenditure in the health sector must be prioritised for primary health care particularly for drugs for the poor i have therefore allocated a 30 percent increase to primary health care next year amounting to sh22b the largest single increase in the entire budget in recognition of this priority next year funding for service delivery at health sub district level will rise by 35 percent to sh14 5b of which 50 percent will be allocated to essential drugs we need to increase efficiency and accountability in drug distribution and use and reduce unauthorised diversion of drugs to private clinics 85 to strengthen access to adequate reproductive will be placed on improving the referral system at the health sub district level and increasing the proportion of deliveries attended to by skilled health professionals to a targeted level of 40 percent to this end provision has been made for upgrading health centre iiis transport to improve emergency maternal referral systems and theatre equipment in hc ivs in addition more resources specifically for reproductive health activities have been included in the national service delivery programs 86 the completion of the primary health care payroll cleaning exercise is expected to identify efficiency savings which will enable further recruitment of essential cadres at phc level training of nursing assistants will continue with the provision of sh2b next year sensitisation on the role of the proposed village health teams will begin at the national level and in selected districts mbarara university intake will significantly increase thus expanding the number of health workers more quickly for this initiative water and sanitation 87 mr speaker as i indicated earlier access to safe water and sanitation is critical for the health of our population the medium term objective of government is to raise access to safe water in rural areas to 65 percent and rural household sanitation to 75 percent by 2005 88 during this year rural safe water coverage has risen to 88 percent from 88 8 percent last year and over 10 million people can now access safe water in the area of rural sanitation the budget this year provided for the construction of 4 139 school latrines among other activities during 2002 03 the budget will provide for the protection of 200 springs the construction of 900 shallow wells and the drilling and rehabilitating of 2 400 boreholes 89 nineteen schemes for the supply of clean water in small towns were planned and completed this year the budget next year will provide for the construction of 50 piped water systems in selected rural growth centres and for 92 boreholes and 33 gravity flow schemes with 400 taps in other centres in addition 200 public latrines will be constructed nine more water schemes are at the tender stage 90 the nwsc has improved its service coverage in the urban centres from 56 percent in june 2001 to about 59 percent at present this year nwsc rehabilitated the water and sewerage systems in jinja and kabale and the activities next year include completion of the plan for increasing water supply in kampala and entebbe the extension of water supplies to malaba town the refurbishment of gabal water works to increase water production by 10 000 cubic metres per day and the improving of service delivery to the peri urban areas through the increased stand posts program social development 91 a social development sector strategic investment plan sdssip is being developed to build capacity at community level to promote socio economic development the functional adult literacy program has expanded into 11 new districts an extensive program was conducted for teachers and supervisors and 149 000 adult learners were enrolled during 2002 03 funds are prevised for purchase of specialised equipment for the disabled at learning centres there will be activities for upgrading of sub county community development assistants to enable them to more effectively mobilise the population for socio economic development revenue and expenditure projected revenue and expenditure outturns for fy 2001 02 92 the expected outturn or ura revenue collection this year is sh1207b an increase of 19 1 percent over last year but sh52b short of the approved budget estimate of sh1259b collections rose in terms of gdp to 11 3 percent from 10 7 percent some items of taxation performed much better than expected income tax in particular but other items particularly taxes on international trade performed below expectations 93 total non ura domestic revenue collection is estimated at sh39b this year compared to the approved budget estimate of sh41 6b reforms to non tax revenue collection by ministries that i introduced this year are beginning to bear fruit however much remains to be done to realise the full potential of this source of revenue as i shall elaborate later loan repayments due by public enterprises to government have fallen below expectations by sh33b partly due to the rollback of the electricity tariff increases last july 94 the outturn for government expenditure excluding donor financed projects is projected at sh1 888b this financial year equivalent to a 98 4 percent performance against the approved budget of sh1 918 7b this under performance was due to domestic resource shortfalls 95 the wage component of the budget is expected to perform at 100 percent of the approved budget with over expenditures in the paf wage bill compensating for savings in non paf wage expenditures non wage recurrent expenditures are projected to exceed the approved budget by about 2 5 percent due to over expenditures in some votes mainly in the public administration sector over the past year these over expenditures coupled with the shortfall in domestic resources have necessitated cuts in the releases to the non wage recurrent and development budgets of several ministries overall development spending is projected to be below the approved budget by more than 10 percent with non paf projects performing at 83 percent of their approved budget paf expenditures have performed at 98 percent of the approved budget proposed revenue and expenditure for fy 2002 03 96 mr speaker the mtef ceiling next year will grow at a much reduced rate relative to this year our fiscal deficit has widened too fast over the last few years in relation to gdp financed by large inflows of budget support the rapid rate of increase far in excess of the natural growth of the economy has put upward pressures on the exchange rate as the donor funds have to a large extent been spent in the domestic economy these upward pressures are likely to undermine the success of our export efforts moreover the rapid rise in the fiscal deficit financed by donor support has increased our reliance on donor support which have little predictability from year to year it is only prudent that we reduce our reliance on them in the medium and long term 97 mr speaker starting with this budget i will gradually reduce the fiscal deficit as a ratio of gdp with a target of about 10 8 percent of gdp next year from the expected outturn of 11 4 percent of gdp for the current year i wish to indicate that i am including donor financed projects in the calculation of the fiscal deficit as they have a macroeconomic impact just as much as the spending by government insufficient data has until now made it impossible for us to meaningfully include donor financed projects within the mtef spending ceilings starting in fy 2003 04 all donor financed projects will be integrated into these ceilings 98 total revenue for fy 2002 03 is estimated to increase by 14 9 percent over this year s expected outturn to sh1 433b or 12 3 percent of gdp this includes revenue expected to be raised from new tax measures and efficiency gains i shall describe these measures shortly revenues collected by ura are projected to increase by 15 3 percent to sh1 392b non ura non tax revenues are projected at sh40 5b 99 the transfer of responsibility in fy 2001 02 for collection of passport fees to ura has dramatically illustrated the substantial gains to be made in nontax revenue collections passport fee collections are expected to be 300 percent above the budget estimate for the year i therefore intend to transfer the cash collection function to the ura for more items currently collected by ministries another important measure will be the tightening up of the receipting accounting and reporting arrangements and the reduction of leakages through embezzlement i expect these measures to yield an efficiency premium of about 20 percent 100 our external resources consist of budget support loans and grants including hipcs debt relief and project loans and grants that finance development projects outside the consolidated fund budget support loans and grants are projected to increase to sh 813b next year from an estimated outturn of sh783b this financial year project loans and grants are projected at sh632b next financial year 101 total government expenditure next year excluding donor projects will amount to sh2 038b 17 4 percent of gdp consisting of sh628b for wage expenditures shs908b for other recurrent expenditures and sh502b for development expenditures this represents an increase of sh150b or 8 percent over the expected outturn for this current year 102 the expenditure on paf programs next financial year is budgeted at sh682b equivalent to 35 5 percent of the budget compared to sh611n projected this current year or 35 1 percent of expenditure 103 with domestic revenue of sh1 433b and total expenditure including donor projects of sh2 696b the fiscal deficit next year is projected at sh1 263b 10 8 percent of gdp this will be financed by sh861b in external grants and sh402b in net external and domestic financing this comprises external financing of sh462b and negative sh60b of domestic financing which includes arrears payments savings in the banking system and non bank financing constitutional autonomous bodies 104 mr speaker the budgetary proposals of the accounting bodies have been submitted in compliance with article 155 2 of the constitution in compliance with article 155 3 of the constitution the government has made recommendations on them i hereby lay both the budgetary proposals and the recommendations of the government before the house as required by the constitution 105 in order for me to submit a complete national budget for your consideration in accordance with article 155 1 of the constitution the budget provisions of these self accounting bodies incorporated into the medium term expenditure framework are in accordance with the resource envelope conveyed to the self accounting bodies in the course of our discussions and presented to parliament as per the budget act 2001 schedule of indebtedness 106 mr speaker in accordance with the provisions of section 13 1 and 2 of the budget act i hereby lay before the house the statement on i government s total indebtedness as at 31st march 2002 and ii the grants that the government of the republic of uganda received during the financial year 2001 02 with respect to section 13 3 of the same act i am pleased to announce that during the financial year 2001 2002 government did not guarantee any loans and provide grants to any individual or statutory body details of the utilisation and the performance of each loan and grant including the extent of the achievements of the objective targets will be provided in the policy statements of the responsible ministers taxation tax measures 107 mr speaker the focus for tax policy in 2002 03 will be on objectives of i stimulating the economy ii strengthening tax administration and iii raising tax revenue to meet our rising expenditure needs and reduce the fiscal deficit 108 as i earlier indicated strengthening tax administration is the main avenue open to us for mobilizing extra revenues ura as the body responsible for collecting tax requires re organisation and strengthening in an effort to strengthen the authority funds have been allocated for next financial year for the purchase and installation of an integrated modern computer system and for other such equipment including scanners 109 nevertheless mr speaker we face a resource gap of sh20b for next financial year as the efficiency measures for ura will have their main impact only in the medium term i have no alternative but to make modest adjustments in tax rates in order to bridge the gap 110 i shall now proceed to outline taxation and tax measures for next financial year value added tax 111 mr speaker information and communications technology have become so important world over for processing and accessing data it is important that uganda should not be left out of development of information technology i am therefore removing vat on computers and accessories to promote development of information technology government contracts 112 mr speaker some contracting companies have been undertaking government contracts when they are not registered for vat as a result they have been under cutting tax paying firms in order to create an even playing field future government contracts with businesses both at the centre and local government will only be awarded to vat registered persons excise duty on local goods 113 mr speaker in order to stimulate consumption of beer the excise duty is being reduced from 70 percent to 60 percent motor vehicles and license fees 114 mr speaker i am raising the excise duty by five percentage points on all vehicles imported except commercial vehicles the details are contained in the finance bill this measure will generate additional revenue of sh3b 115 mr speaker to ameliorate the problems faced by dealers holding franchises in new cars because of the limitation in the warehousing period i am proposing that the warehousing period be extended to 24 months from the current maximum of 12 months the details are contained in the customs management amendment bill 116 mr speaker many second hand vehicles imported into uganda are environmentally hazardous not road worthy and it is difficult to determine their value accordingly with effect from september 2002 all second hand vehicles imported into the country will first have to be inspected and certified by a competent authority in the country of origin this is to keep in line with the other east african countries details are contained in the finance bill and will also be published in the newspapers 117 mr speaker i have adjusted various fees and licenses under the traffic act with regard to the fees and charges applicable to motor vehicles the details are contained in the finance bill this measure will generate revenues of about sh6b fuel 118 fuel excise duty rates have been held constant for the last four years at sh580 per litre for petrol sh370 per litre for diesel and sh200 per litre for paraffin despite the fact that consumer prices have risen by 16 percent since then mr speaker the current specific rate on petrol of sh580 per litre is being adjusted by sh30 to sh610 per litre this modest adjustment will partly make up for loss in the real value of the rate since 1998 this measure will take effect from 15th june 2002 and is expected to raise sh7b polythene bags and plastic containers 119 mr speaker the difficulties in disposal of polythene bags and plastic containers has given rise to serious environmental concerns including the blockage of drainage and soil degradation material action is required in order to encourage producers and consumers to economise on the use of these bags and bottles and to develop more environmentally friendly alternatives i am accordingly imposing an excise duty of 20 percent on polythene bags and plastic containers the details are contained in the finance bill customs duties 120 mr speaker no changes are proposed in the tariff structure however adjustments to the hs code duty rates are proposed to take into account developments under the eac and also to accommodate changes decided by the world customs cooperation council the details are contained in the finance bill second hand goods 121 mr speaker you may recall that uganda was a leading producer of cotton with a vibrant textile industry many ugandans were employed in cotton production and a textile industry and expert tailors had also emerged this was a source of livelihood to many families due to our past turmoil all this fell in ruins attempts have been made to revive the textile sector but this is being undermined by the importation of used clothing mr speaker for the textile sector to develop there must be sufficient demand locally it is in this regard mr speaker that i am increasing the current excise duty by a modest five percentage points the details are contained in the finance bill sugar 122 mr speaker it has come to our attention that sugar producing countries are providing heavy subsidies to their producers as a result importers are landing sugar into the country at very low prices thereby unfairly undermining local industries to counter this uncompetitive practice i am increasing the excise duty on imported sugar from 10 per cent to 20 per cent bank of uganda be exempt from income tax 123 it is the worldwide practice mr speaker for central banks to be exempt from income tax provided it annually transfers its profits to government after appropriate contributions to reserves exempting the central bank makes no difference in principle to the amount of government receipts while exemption reduces tax revenue there is a corresponding increase in the transfer of dividends to government for the above reasons mr speaker an amendment is proposed to list bank of uganda as an exempt institution under the income tax act details are contained in the income tax amendment bill livestock development levy 124 mr speaker a 15 percent levy is to be charged on fob for on all raw hides and skins of bovine animals leaving uganda details are contained in the finance bili east african community 125 we have fully participated in the development of the east african community and we remain committed to the integration process in the spirit of the eac student visa fees for nationals from kenya and tanzania studying in uganda are abolished 126 all these measures will take effect from 1 july except fuel which takes immediate effect from 15th of june 2002 conclusion 127 mr speaker financial year 2002 03 presents a major challenge in enhancing the implementation of the president s manifesto over the next year and for the medium term efforts to develop and reposition uganda s increasing exports for higher quality production and greater competitiveness in the regional and international markets will be much more enhanced this is critical to the achievement of uganda s long term goal of eradicating absolute poverty by the year 2017 our development partners are commended for their initiatives in promoting these efforts but these have to be sustained and deepened 128 mr speaker i wish to reiterate the government s commitment to reduce the cost of public administration promote reforms for greater accountability and efficiency in all public sector operations and aim for maximum effectiveness of our programs these are matters on which both the executive and the legislature are fully agreed this is the only way to achieve our goals of reducing our dependence achieving higher growth ensuring better standards of living for our people and coping with the ever increasing challenges in the globalized environment of the 21st century 129 mr speaker i want once again to express my satisfaction with the cooperation of parliament in the process of preparing this budget as provided for in the budget act 2001 in order to achieve our mutual objectives i call upon members to be in the forefront working with the executive and the local governments to ensure the successful implementation of this budget once they have approved it in this connection urgent consideration and approval of the public finance and accountability bill will be critical in ensuring the desired budget discipline 130 i highly commend this budget to you mr speaker and honorable members i beg to move for god and my country

david malpass current economic momentum remains weak while heightened debt levels and subdued investment growth in developing economies are holding countries back from achieving their potential it s urgent that countries make significant structural reforms that improve the business climate and attract investment they also need to make debt management and transparency a high priority so that new

emerging and developing economies as hard won cuts in public debt ratios prior to the financial crisis have to a large extent been reversed emerging and developing economies need to strike a careful balance between borrowing to promote growth and avoiding risks associated with excessive borrowing growth rates in low income countries are expected to rise to 6 in 2020 from 5 4 in 2019 but that is still not enough to substantially reduce poverty while a number of low income countries progressed to middle income status between 2000 and 2018 the remaining low income countries face steeper challenges to achieving similar progress many are poorer than the countries that made the leap to higher income levels and are fragile disadvantaged by geography and heavily reliant on agriculture

constraints a sustained pickup in investment growth is necessary to meet key development goals business climate reforms can help encourage private investment sharp currency depreciations are more common in emerging and developing economies than in advanced economies and central banks are often required to respond to these fluctuations to maintain price stability the exchange rate pass through

i assumed the uk would be out of the eu on 29 march 2019 as often promised by the prime minister with or without a deal instead i find my book on the growing gap between traditional parties and the voters and growing distrust of experts and governing institutions is eerily topical for the uk as well as the rest of the eu as background to the recent european elections the uk became caught in a time warp fighting european elections three years after it decided to come out two new challenger parties the brexit party and change uk the remain party emerged to turn the elections in the uk into a kind of rerun of the referendum vote change was soon supplanted in its aim by the liberal democrats an old protest party reborn as remain campaigners the establishment lib dems and change uk battled to keep the uk in and to prevent any alteration in our relationship with brussels whilst the brexit party campaigned to implement the referendum decision change uk found it difficult to explain why they call themselves change when they are a force against change when it comes to accepting all the rules laws and powers of the eu the current number one topic of debate they also suffered from the fact that the mps that formed them had campaigned in the 2017 election on either the labour or conservative manifesto which promised brexit the two traditional main parties labour and the conservatives claim to still want the uk to leave the eu meanwhile labour has many mps and members who want to reverse brexit and propose a second referendum to do so undermining their credentials with leave voters the conservatives under mrs may promised to leave by 29 march this year with or without a deal at the last minute the prime minister decided to seek a delay in our leaving instead
china exports grow despite u s tariffs but import slump most in nearly three years china s exports unexpectedly returned to growth in may despite higher u s tariffs but imports fell the most in nearly three years in a further sign of weak domestic demand that could prompt beijing to step up stimulus measures some analysts suspected chinese exporters may have rushed out shipments to the united states to avoid new tariffs on 300 billion of goods that president donald trump is threatening to impose in a rapidly escalating trade dispute but monday s better than expected export data is unlikely to ease fears that a longer and costlier u s china trade war may no longer be avoidable pushing the global economy towards recession china s may exports rose 1 1 from a year earlier compared with market expectations for a modest decline customs data showed we expect export growth to remain positive in june likely supported by continued front loading of u s bound exports but it should then tumble in the third quarter when we expect the threatened tariffs to be imposed economists at nomura said in a note to clients therefore we believe beijing will likely step up its stimulus measures to

reneged on promises to make structural changes to its economic practices trump on may 10 slapped higher tariffs of up to 25 on 200 billion of chinese goods and then took steps to levy duties on all remaining 300 billion chinese imports beijing retaliated with tariff hikes on u s goods trump has said he expects to hold a meeting with chinese president xi jinping at a g20 leaders summit late this

gross domestic product gdp in the united states has grown consistently since the great recession of 2008 but middle class and lower income workers have not had their share of the rewards from this economic expansion three trillion dollars of output has been added to the ranks of u s gdp in the past ten years while median hourly pay for american workers has increased by less than eighty cents this isn t the way it was supposed to be whenever the united states experienced economic growth wages generally rose along with it that is until the 1980s since then workers have been badly left behind compared to the robust wage growth of earlier times most american workers haven t seen a substantial raise in forty years while the poorest workers have only recently seen incomes rise slightly above 1980 levels since 1979 median wages have stagnated for every income strata but the very top where incomes have risen rapidly for four decades the rich have captured almost all the rewards of growth generating the hazardous levels of inequality we see today figure 1 this story of disappearing american wages is familiar by now but it bears repeating the failure of incomes to rise has fundamentally reshaped the american economy contributing to working class bitterness a persistently high poverty rate and a dispirited electorate as wages have stagnated the prices of basic goods such as housing health care education and child care adjusted for inflation have consistently trended upward the sharp decline of private sector unions has badly weakened bargaining power of labor and undermined protections against exploitative employers coupled with the sharp drop in manufacturing jobs there s no longer a reliable path to middle class incomes for workers without a college degree furthermore the failure to raise the minimum wage more than marginally until recently has also punished lower income workers the rise of piecemeal and gig economy work has introduced new and profound precarity insecure and capricious employment into more workers lives americans now work longer hours for less pay than their european counterparts americans now work longer hours for less pay than their european counterparts tightening labor markets typically force employers to pay their workers more and so the recent drop in unemployment rates has given some hope for broad wage growth the unemployment rate has fallen sharply in the recovery since the great recession and in april 2019 reached 3 6 percent a rate not seen since the late 1970s but unlike previous booms the stronger labor market of the past ten years has failed to generate commensurate wage growth the small wages gains of recent years for lower and middle income workers have scarcely made up for decades of torpor meanwhile the costs of basic goods as noted continue to rise 40 percent of americans struggle to pay for at least one basic need such as food or rent and cannot pay for an emergency costing 400 families who are making ends meet are doing so by working longer hours while stock market prices have risen greatly in recent years this growth has mostly benefited the wealthy as middle and working class americans have little direct exposure to the stock market but 84 3 percent of middle income americans have some form of debt meanwhile the federal government s policies toward poverty have shifted from supplying direct cash help to establishing work related tax credits while the poverty rate has fallen over time in the united states it still remains near the highest of the rich world and those u s families in poverty are receiving aid from a shrinking puddle of support for 99 percent of welfare recipients the purchasing power of their benefits is lower now than it was in 1996 and the number of poor families receiving support has plummeted in 2017 less than a quarter of families with children in poverty receive benefits the major new work related programs earned income tax eitc credit and child tax credit ctc are among the most progressive aspects of our tax code transferring billions of dollars to low income workers but these programs remain inadequate to the task of alleviating poverty especially households in deep poverty having income below half the federal poverty level as a un report summarized in 2017 neither wealth nor its power nor its technology is being harnessed to address the situation in which 40 million people continue to live in poverty the united states has a child poverty rate of 21 percent the highest in the developed world and also has the highest child mortality rate among the twenty richest countries poverty also afflicts the nonwhite u s population at disproportionately high levels though blacks and hispanics account for less than a third of the population they account for two thirds of children living in poverty the united states has a child poverty rate of 21 percent the highest in the developed world and also has the highest child mortality rate among the twenty richest countries corroborating the data the american people do not think the recent economic gains are fully reaching them in an april poll only 12 percent of americans say their family has benefited a great deal from the current economy another 31 percent say that they have received some benefit but a majority of americans say the nation s recent macroeconomic growth has either not helped their families much 27 percent or not helped them at all 27 percent a survey conducted in march of last year around the time president trump was declaring the arrival of the greatest economy in the history of america found that most americans believe our economy makes it too tough for the middle class to make ends meet and only 39 percent think congress and the president are working to improve their financial situation the struggles of working americans are not natural or unavoidable effects of an american economy in a globalized world nor the price we pay for the sustained growth of the past few years but rather the result of deliberate policy choices the struggles of working americans are not natural or unavoidable effects of an american economy in a globalized world nor the price we pay for the sustained growth of the past few years but rather the result of deliberate policy choices this report will explain three categories of strategies for providing income support to remedy the dire and unjust circumstances faced by millions of american families 1 money transfers generated by tax credits to reduce inequality now the largest transfer of income after social security medicare and medicaid 2 direct government creation of good jobs and 3 interventions to share wealth and generate more worker control over capital from employee stock sharing schemes to social wealth funds in each section the report will explain existing programs and proposals their histories the politics surrounding them and discuss their relative merits and drawbacks transfer programs one approach to building a livable society for all americans is to have the government supplement incomes in this approach the government basically leaves the job market alone but fills in the gap to boost everyone s income up so that they can get by this section will focus on two ways the government can do this 1 through refundable tax credits such as the earned income credit and the child tax credit and 2 through direct transfers in the form of basic income payments and or cash allowances earned income tax credit child tax credit among rich nations the united states has a stingy welfare state with regard to low income americans in the 1990s amid the racialized welfare panic generated by reaganite republicans and embraced by clintonite democrats eager to reposition themselves as belt tightening realists the federal government replaced the more generous aid to families with dependent children afdc with temporary aid for needy families tanf which provides block grants to states and tends to impose stringent work requirements on beneficiaries politicians across the spectrum embraced this form of workfare as a way of signaling their preference for the deserving that is working poor over the undeserving poor who were perceived as lazy and deviant and who were typically depicted in the media as nonwhite in the intervening years cash welfare has been winnowed away to almost nothing despite relatively stable rates of poverty as the center for budget and policy priorities cbpp reports between 2006 and 2017 the number of families in poverty fell by 8 percent from about 6 million to about 5 6 million while the number of families receiving tanf fell by 34 percent from 1 9 million to less than 1 3 million since this shift in the 1990s the federal government has embraced tax credits as its principal way to transfer income in 2017 the combined federal and state expenditures on tanf amounted to 31 1 billion only 7 1 billion 23 percent of which was used for cash assistance to needy families the rest went to work education training and child care programs by contrast in the same year the earned income tax credit eitc was responsible for 68 billion in income support for low wage earners almost all eitc benefits accrue to workers in the lowest 40 percent of the income distribution but the distribution of benefits within that 40 percent is an important matter the child tax credit ctc which benefits a larger swath of wage earning families distributed 52 billion in 2017 these refundable tax credits are now the main means of transferring income to the nation s poor and working classes only social security transfers more income and lifts more out of poverty and unlike tanf the eitc and ctc are distributed as tax credits by the irs avoiding much of the administrative bloat associated with other means tested transfer programs the eitc was established under gerald ford as part of the tax reduction act of 1975 originally a small temporary 10 percent credit for a family s first 4 000 in income the eitc was made permanent by jimmy carter in 1978 it has since been expanded by ronald reagan in 1986 george h w bush in 1990 and bill clinton in 1993 the last round of which was the first expansion to provide a nominal credit to childless adults the ctc was established in 1997 both george w bush and barack obama reduced the credit s marriage penalty under which jointly filing couples receive smaller benefits obama lowered the amount workers needed to earn before receiving the maximum tax credit the eitc s bipartisan history and its somewhat stealth status as a tax expenditure rather than an appropriation has protected it from attacks on other parts of the welfare state the eitc is designed to incentivize and reward work if a worker doesn t earn any income the eitc doesn t provide any benefit as a worker s income grows the eitc increases eventually reaching a plateau the benefit then gradually phases out at higher incomes this system a phase in a plateau and a phase out generates the telltale trapezoidal shape associated with these income based tax credits up flat down the amount of eitc you earn per dollar of income also depends on how many children you have in 2018 the credit maxed out at 3 461 for a single child family it maxed out at 6 431 for a family of three unlike other tax credits the eitc is fully refundable for those who meet the earnings threshold meaning that if the value of a worker s eitc exceeds their tax liability they receive the difference as a refund because the lowest earners also have the lowest income tax burden the refundability of the eitc is crucial to its redistributive capacity the ctc however is only partially refundable in 2019 working families can receive a refund equal to 15 percent of their earnings above 2 500 together according to the center on budget and policy priorities cbpp a liberal think tank the eitc and ctc lifted 8 9 million people including 4 8 million children above the poverty line in 2017 and made an additional 20 2 million people less poor children who have benefited from tax credit expansions have higher odds of finishing high school and attending college and even tend to earn more as adults the positive effects of the eitc may go beyond poverty reduction income gains from the eitc and ctc research suggests yield benefits for children at every stage of life eitc has been linked with better prenatal care reduced maternal stress and improved infant health children who have benefited from tax credit expansions have higher odds of finishing high school and attending college and even tend to earn more as adults proponents say the eitc s anti poverty effects maybe be understated by head count poverty numbers that s because the eitc is also designed to encourage participation in the labor force and thereby boost incomes the upward slope of the phase in subsidizes wages making work more rewarding and theoretically encouraging people to work more for years research backed up this assumption the eitc thus continues to be captured by 1990s era myths about the deviance of the nonworking poor in a way that compromises its ability to combat deep poverty there are three concerns however for one the trapezoidal shape of the benefits curve means that the neediest families those earning no wages are structurally excluded from the benefit of the 40 6 million americans living in poverty only one quarter participate in the labor force several studies have proven that the nonworking population is primarily composed of children students the elderly the disabled the sick and caregivers the eitc thus continues to be captured by 1990s era myths about the deviance of the nonworking poor in a way that compromises its ability to combat deep poverty second any eitc induced increase in the nation s labor supply may drive wages down in this way a large portion of the value of the eitc is actually captured by employers who are able to pay reduced wages in simple terms the eitc may encourage workers to enter and remain in low paid jobs that would be insufficient if not for the tax credit economist jess rothstein has found that employers capture thirty cents of every dollar spent on eitc subsidizing low wage employers is not what anti poverty champions of the eitc intend for the program but that s what it does and third new research has called into question the labor force participation effects of the eitc princeton economist henrik kleven has found that phased in income tax credits don t necessarily increase the labor supply and that most of the research proving they did was based on a single event the expansion of the eitc in 1993 and a subsequent increase in labor force participation by single mothers kleven found little evidence of major labor supply effects in the wake of other expansions of the eitc or the establishments of eitc in various states if kleven s research is correct then the justification for excluding the nonworking poor from benefits that the eitc instead encourages them to work is based on mistaken assumptions in other words if trapezoids don t succeed at encouraging work then all they really do is cruelly deprive the most needy populations of income transfers and perpetuate the toxic distinction between deserving and undeserving poor settling the empirical question of whether or not the eitc encourages work will take time debate and research a study of a municipally funded eitc for childless adults including noncustodial parents indeed found a modest increase in employment rates but even if kleven is wrong there are other ways to increase labor force participation that do not punish the poorest americans as covered in the next section what we already know is that the eitc and ctc fail to reach those with the most need that is a problem which we can and should fix now reform proposals for the eitc and ctc multiple members of congress and presidential candidates have recently proposed expansions to the eitc coupled with proposals to make fully refundable and eliminate the phase in for the ctc effectively turning the credit into an unconditional child allowance for low income families senate democrats led by sherrod brown oh michael bennet co dick durbin il and ron wyden or have rallied behind the working families tax relief act wftra which would expand the eitc by 25 percent for families with children and quadruple the credit for childless workers it would also modestly boost the ctc and make it fully refundable meaning low income families would benefit from the credit even if they don t earn enough to incur income tax the american family act provides a bigger child allowance to more lower and middle class families paying 3 000 per year or 250 per month per child ages 6 to 16 and 3 600 per year or 300 per month per child ages 0 to 5 it wouldn t begin to phase out until 130 000 a year in income for single parents and 180 000 for married couples senator kamala harris ca has proposed the lift the middle class act which would expand the eitc to benefit much of the middle class in addition to the working poor it features a much steeper phase in providing a dollar of credit for each dollar of income until maxing out at 3 000 for individuals and 6 000 for couples a longer plateau and a more gradual phase out a proposal by senator sherrod brown and representative ro khanna ca the grow american incomes now gain act is more modest it proposes doubling the eitc for households with children and increasing it considerably for the childless poor by maintaining the trapezoidal shape 0 credit for 0 in earned income both of these proposals still exclude the nonworking poor representative bonnie watson coleman nj has introduced the eitc modernization act which would make the eitc available to students and caregivers at a base rate of 100 month effectively providing a small basic income for those eligible polling by liberal think tank data for progress found substantial support for expanding eitc to caregivers and students including among a majority of republicans two to one support among independents and overwhelming support among democrats these proposals recognize the enduring political value of tying tax credits to work effort but seek to broaden the definition of work to include unpaid labor direct transfer through basic income by eliminating the phase in for the ctc and making it fully refundable the working families tax relief act wftra and the american family act provide a small guaranteed income to families with children regardless of whether they earn wages this sort of universal or near universal benefit both proposals phase out at high incomes is a crucial poverty reduction tool in almost every other rich country almost all of which have lower rates of child poverty than the united states though work requirements or trapezoidal phase ins have been the vogue in washington for decades now policy proposals have recently resurfaced for guaranteeing income regardless of work it s not difficult to redesign the eitc to benefit nonworking people as well simply start the phase in at 500 or whatever amount so that everyone or almost everyone gets it regardless of income in effect this would mean adding a small guaranteed income to the eitc plans for guaranteed income sometimes called universal basic income ubi minimum income or a negative income tax which differ in their particulars have been tossed around washington for decades often with bipartisanship milton friedman martin luther king jr and daniel patrick moynihan have all entertained the idea of or advocated for basic income at various times richard nixon almost passed one in his 1971 state of the union address nixon listed his plan to place a floor under the income of every family with children in america as his top legislative priority in his 1971 state of the union address nixon listed his plan to place a floor under the income of every family with children in america as his top legislative priority but the same myths about the inherent indolence of the poor perpetuated by conservative figures such as charles murray and george gilder and the last minute intervention by an ayn rand obsessed advisor convinced nixon to abandon the idea of a guaranteed income in favor of workfare basic income has to some degree reemerged as a boutique policy idea embraced by techno utopians in silicon valley and certain strains of democratic socialists alike the policy advantages of basic income over means tested welfare such as tanf and a phased in tax credit such as eitc are various unlike tanf a basic income program wouldn t need to be administered by an army of caseworkers responsible for ensuring not only that poor people receive cash but also that they are behaving well seeking work avoiding drugs and pursuing stable relationships unlike the eitc a basic income or a guaranteed child allowance for that matter could be targeted to help the poorest members of society not just those who can work and unlike both programs a basic income by not distinguishing between deserving and undeserving poor could put us on a pathway to abandoning the pernicious myths about the moral deprivation of the neediest members of society the potential benefits of a basic income are not necessarily limited to eliminating poverty as many proponents have put it a basic income gives people the power to say no a ubi reduces personal dependency on exploitative employers overbearing welfare administrators and domestic partners and guarantees that no one is completely left behind and excluded from society writes maximilian kasy of harvard and data for progress and basic income can be considered remuneration for the socially valuable work that typically goes unrewarded under capitalism the arts caring for children and the elderly civic participation and so on without having individuals prove they are engaged in that work the idea of a guaranteed income is not as far fetched as it seems every alaskan already receives an annual dividend typically between 800 and 2 000 from the alaska permanent fund a sovereign wealth fund the idea of a guaranteed income is not as far fetched as it seems every alaskan already receives an annual dividend typically between 800 and 2 000 from the alaska permanent fund a sovereign wealth fund more on those in the final section of this paper kasy recently proposed a modest basic income plan under which individuals with no income would receive the highest net benefit of 7 000 as income increases under kasy s plan a larger and larger portion of the basic income is taxed back in this way kasy s plan is indistinguishable from a negative income tax some basic income supporters especially those of a libertarian bent intend to pay for the benefit by eliminating all other social welfare programs venture for america founder and presidential candidate andrew yang for example proposed a valued added tax vat in addition to projected savings from cutting other government spending on the symptoms of poverty incarceration homelessness sickness the major fear with this approach is that the basic income proposed would be insufficient and yet the cuts to social programs would become permanent research conducted by economists jessica wiederspan elizabeth rhodes and luke shaefer suggests the united states could adopt a household based negative income tax sufficient to wipe out poverty altogether for the combined cost of the eitc food stamps tanf school meal programs housing subsidies and supplemental security income a program for the elderly there would be winners and losers in this scenario for example eitc disproportionately benefits low income families just above or below the poverty line they d get less help under the proposed negative income tax but the study suggests eliminating poverty through income transfer is not out of reach even assuming no additional revenue from more progressive taxation wealth taxes or a vat basic income s conservative opponents say it will decrease work incentives and allow some to freeload on the labor of others basic income also has opponents on the left seth ackerman executive editor at jacobin has argued that basic income creates arbitrary classes of able bodied people who do not work while others do others argue that a basic income would provide cover for companies to hire still more independent contractors and part time workers undermining living wages without facing wider backlash from the precariously employed a basic income these critics suggest is hush money paid to the masses dislocated by neoliberalism and automation the research on the effect of variously sized basic incomes on labor market participation is inconclusive an encouraging study of the alaska permanent fund found that possible reductions in employment seem to be offset by increases in spending that in turn increase the demand for more workers proponents argue it is worth considering whether some degree of nonparticipation in work is worth the benefit of alleviating poverty and providing a floor of basic material comfort and dignity for all low income families moreover as will be discussed in the next section it may be possible to correct the perverse labor market effects of generous income transfers in the form of active labor market policy and other regulations government creation of good jobs in his 1944 state of the union address his last franklin delano roosevelt introduced an economic bill of rights the first of which was a right to a useful and remunerative job two years later congress passed the employment act of 1946 which first established full employment as a national goal though fdr and some advisors had hoped to establish a permanent federal employment program a post crisis successor to the new deal s federal jobs programs such as the works progress administration and civil conservation corps they were thwarted but the dream of a job guarantee has lived on through the civil rights movement coretta scott king continued to champion genuine full employment legislation after her husband s death her work contributing to the inclusion of a job guarantee office in an early version of what would become the full employment and balanced growth act of 1978 known as the humphrey hawkins act today the idea of federally guaranteed jobs is experiencing a renaissance its proponents reject the mainstream economic hypothesis that unemployment cannot fall below a certain rate without generating debilitating inflation today s unemployment rate of around 3 percent doesn t account for millions of workers who have stopped actively seeking a job or those inadequately employed in temporary seasonal or other precarious employment situations today s full employment leaves 6 7 million americans unemployed and 5 million in part time work who would prefer full time furthermore the number of black unemployment is at least twice as high as white unemployment today s full employment leaves 6 7 million americans unemployed and 5 million in part time work who would prefer full time supporters of a guaranteed jobs program which now include three presidential candidates generally point to a few key benefits of the policy 1 it would eliminate involuntary unemployment regardless of the economic cycle 2 it would restructure the labor market by establishing a minimum floor of wages and benefits that the private sector would have to exceed to attract workers 3 it would provide macroeconomic stabilization by maintaining employment and buying power during downturns and 4 it would provide socially useful goods and services especially those that are undervalued by the free market since 2017 the center for american progress cap and cbpp both center left think tanks have rolled out detailed proposals for a federal jobs guarantee joining economists such as pavlina tcherneva and stephanie kelton associated with modern monetary theory who have long advocated for such a program a proposal from mark paul william darity jr and darrick hamilton commissioned by the cbpp calls for a minimum annual salary of 24 600 mean salary of 32 500 both indexed to inflation retirement plans paid family and sick leave one week of paid vacation per three months worked and health insurance for full time workers they estimate an annual cost of 543 billion or just under 3 percent of gdp to create 9 7 million full time positions cap s domestic marshall plan doesn t call for eliminating involuntary unemployment altogether but rather for setting the target employment to population epop ratio for prime age workers without a bachelor s degree at the year 2000 peak of 79 percent this cap says would require the creation of 4 4 million jobs and cost 158 billion per year these ideas have found a voice in washington senators kirsten gillibrand d ny cory booker d nj and bernie sanders i vt have included a job guarantee in their presidential platforms booker backs a pilot program in fifteen urban and rural areas offering every adult living there a 15 an hour job with paid leave and health benefits sanders has proposed an immediate large scale implementation a nationwide job guarantee at a living wage for every american worker who wants or needs one orchestrated by twelve regional offices who would approve proposals for public works projects from all over the country though they are not mutually exclusive jobs guarantees and the basic income proposals are often juxtaposed in liberal policy debates job guarantee supporters say that income that doesn t encourage work is harmful because the deleterious effects of unemployment go beyond insufficient income to include higher mortality and suicide rates social isolation and a permanent decline in well being moreover in a nation that values work the stigma associated with idleness is impossible to overcome basic income supporters counter that the sense of fulfillment and sense of purpose that americans acquire from work drops as you go down the income and skill scale a lawyer for example may feel her job is an important part of her identity a fast food worker may not jobs guarantee skeptics question whether socially necessary public works jobs are feasible as an employment of last resort where will the jobs come from many jobs cited as possible jobs guarantee projects climate mitigation and resilience work infrastructure projects child care emergency medical technicians and so on require training and skills that the perpetually unemployed are unlikely to have moreover a jobs guarantee program would expand during down cycles and contract when the economy is booming if the unemployed are to be put to work as caregivers during a downturn will we accept a sudden shortage of caregivers as workers flee to better jobs when the economy picks up if the jobs aren t really going to be socially useful if instead they re make work jobs a jobs guarantee begins to look more like a regressive form of workfare or more precisely as matt bruenig of people s policy project has put it an activation cost for an unemployment benefit if the government thinks climate mitigation and free child care are important projects critics say why wait for an economic crisis to fund them critics of the jobs guarantee point to its high cost and complain that the private sector would struggle to compete with higher paying public sector jobs this of course is precisely the point for supporters of a jobs guarantee who intend for the program to establish a floor but conservatives and liberals have both wondered whether the government is equipped to undertake such a huge and complicated administrative project the jobs guarantee would signal a revolutionary change in the relationship of the u s government to the job market requiring a new set of bureaucratic skills expertise and infrastructure to implement does a hybrid of these ideas a basic income and a jobs guarantee make more sense perhaps a huge investment on the scale needed for a jobs guarantee could be better spent as a combination of subsidies for private sector work targeted and tailored programs for populations facing significant obstacles in the job market such as the formerly incarcerated more generous unemployment benefits or a negative income tax and more active labor market policy to connect the unemployed with existing jobs the elevate economic ladders to end volatility and advance training and employment act introduced this year by senator ron wyden d or and representative danny davis d il for example would create a new funding stream for states to implement subsidized employment programs for both private and public sector jobs and other active labor market policies josh bivens of the economic policy institute has recommended a so called public option for employment as an alternative to a full on job guarantee targeted at unemployment hotspots that can be implemented after the nation achieves full employment via monetary and fiscal policy returning to the issue of cost economic journalist david dayen has noted that we already spend 214 billion per year on economic development subsidies and corporate tax cuts supposedly intended to spur job creation that money could be much more efficiently and equitably spent directly creating good jobs what s more a jobs guarantee appears to be a remarkably popular idea in polling by civis analytics and data for progress a majority of residents in every state support a job guarantee sign up for updates sign up follow us redistributing wealth and power numerous studies have correlated the decline in private sector union membership with the rise of extreme inequality workplace democracy ensures that when a company prospers a greater share of that prosperity is distributed downward without more worker control over the distribution of economic prosperity in other words public control over wealth and the means of generating it our economy will continue to provide lavish comfort for the wealthy while demanding punishing work from the rest of us but if unions aren t about to make a huge comeback it s worth considering how more economic democracy might be fostered in their absence one way to do that is to democratize ownership democratic ownership allows workers to capture a greater share of economic growth growth that has more typically gone to wealthier stockholders in an age of wage stagnation one approach to ensuring more broadly distributed wealth is codetermination under codetermination corporations are required to share power between shareholder representatives and employee representatives germany one of the world s most successful capitalist nations has required 50 percent employee representation on supervisory boards of large corporations since 1976 the rest of eu countries require some degree of codetermination in that time despite fears to the contrary german companies have managed to simultaneously attend more closely to concerns such as job security and wages while maintaining growth in real per capita gdp at slightly higher rates than the united states as justin fox wrote for bloomberg germany also has a higher employment population ratio and life expectancy and lower income inequality than the u s not to mention a national government debt of 64 percent of gdp and falling compared with the u s debt that is 105 percent of gdp and rising in contradistinction to u s corporate boards that prioritize short term boosts to share value writes george tyler a former deputy assistant u s treasury secretary and senior world bank official codetermination boards establish investment policies that nurture long term firm prosperity and bolster local and national communities elizabeth warren d ma has introduced the accountable capitalism act which broadly seeks to shift corporations away from the shareholders first mentality and toward the concept of corporate citizenship an obligation for large corporations to consider the interests of all stakeholders in their decision making one way she proposes doing that is establishing 40 percent codetermination on major corporate boards warren s bill introduced with senator tammy baldwin d wi has backing from one third of senate democrats another more direct way of increasing economic democracy is by embracing more public ownership thomas hanna research director at the democracy collaborative has advocated for the nationalization of distressed banks during the next recession to redirect the financial sector toward serving the public good hanna has also called for more public ownership of other parts of the economy especially those rooted in human need and democratization of the many already publicly controlled utilities in the united states legislation backed by senators sanders and gillibrand has recently brought employee stock ownership plans esops and other cooperatively owned corporations back into the progressive conversation both forms promote more democratic corporate ownership but through slightly different mechanisms while cooperatively owned businesses are governed by a board of worker owners esops are employee benefit plans under which company stock is sold to a trust co owned by the company s employees usually in esops when vested employees resign or retire they receive the value of their shares as a lump sum or can roll them over to another retirement account in principle esops give workers an ownership stake in the company strengthening worker power boosting their incomes and creating greater corporate transparency some studies have found wage boosts associated with esop participation others argue that esops encourage stability and more enlightened stewardship whereas typical corporations prioritize short term profits strong dividends and high compensation packages for the ceos worker owners might consider the impact on job security the environment and the community the proposal that worker owners would change corporate behavior requires that workers with an esop actually have decision making power which has not always been the case furthermore unions sometimes have been wary of esops fearing that workers whose retirement accounts are bound up with company profits are less likely to strike or threaten to strike a 2008 paper produced by the federal reserve bank of new york concluded esops create incentives for unions to become weaker bargainers proponents of collective ownership models hope that some of the 2 3 million businesses privately owned by baby boomers in the united states will be sold to their workers when their owners reach retirement age within the next ten years about 12 percent of the u s workforce is employed at worker owned enterprises of some sort some research suggests these companies are better at weathering economic downturns other studies find employee ownership boosts profits an oft cited model of cooperative ownership on a large scale the mondragon corporation headquartered in the basque region of spain brings in 13 billion in revenue each year from 105 cooperatives employing 75 000 employees worldwide despite evidence of their efficiency and profitability co ops face obstacles they tend to have a harder time accessing finance since lenders can t take control of the company if their investments go bad to combat this legislators have put forward bills to enable the u s business administration to make loans to intermediaries that help finance worker buyouts senator sanders for example has called for a u s employee ownership bank to provide low interest loans grants and technical assistance to help workers purchase businesses through a majority owned employee stock ownership plan or a worker owned cooperative another means of bringing more capital under public control is establishing a sovereign wealth fund swf matt bruenig is perhaps the most vocal u s advocate of this approach modeled on the swfs owned by many nordic social democracies a national swf could be established along lines similar to alaska s state level permanent fund the government would place money and assets into the fund a public entity would manage those assets to generate investment returns and those returns would be used to fund social spending or returned to the populace as dividends bruenig suggests various taxation schemes a vat a financial transactions tax a one time market capitalization tax or a higher inheritance tax to seed the funds which would be one of the more straightforward though still politically challenging ways to reduce wealth inequality conclusion the policy goal should not be only to raise incomes for all but also to guarantee the freedoms that adequate income provides it is worth repeating the lines from the 1966 freedom budget for all americans composed by a philip randolph and bayard rustin which proclaims for the first time everyone in america who is fit and able to work will have a job for the first time everyone who can t work or shouldn t be working will have an income adequate to live in comfort and dignity and that is freedom for freedom from want is the basic freedom from which all others flow for a long time supporters of economic redistribution have been on the defensive a four decade history of retrenchment the reagan era attacks on welfare queens the demonization of the undeserving poor and the subsequent bipartisan embrace of stingy and punishing workfare has constrained our political imaginations our reliance on tax credits which stealthily redistribute considerable income but reifies the notion that non workers are undeserving of aid is the product of this myopia and fear the freedom budget calls on us to imagine beyond the narrow political constraints of the present rather than accepting the terms of the debate inherited from an era of harsh austerity we might start by identifying the policies that would enable every person in america to benefit from boom times and be cushioned in times of economic strife the policies discussed above are popular with large swaths of the public they ve been successful in other countries and in other eras of american life and they are within the capacity of the world s wealthiest nation to implement big and bold ideas can be galvanizing bernie sanders and cory bookers job guarantee kamala harris s generous eitc expansion elizabeth warren s codetermination plan these proposals indicate that the democratic contenders for president appreciate that sometimes the political power necessary to instantiate our vision of the world can be cultivated by naming our goals no matter how far fetched they may seem under present circumstances sanders s 2016 call for a single payer health plan dismissed by mainstream politicians at the time has now led to the embrace of medicare for all by a huge swath of democrats demonstrating that unapologetic advocacy for ambitious policy goals can shift the window of discourse the government can guarantee a decent standard of living for every american but doing so requires leadership we have the policies to eliminate poverty what we don t have is political leaders asserting with conviction that there is no distinction between a deserving and undeserving poor person we have the resources to provide a job to everyone who wants one what we need are more politicians defending the role of government of the public in charting a course for our economy and there is urgency the healthy and thriving economy daily championed by the trump administration is a façade behind which a huge number of american families continue to struggle with low wages underemployment financial stress and destitution in other words the working people who are generating prosperity and growth are not enjoying its benefits we have the tools to change that

escalating the trade war us treasury secretary steven mnuchin said in an interview with cnbc on sunday that trump was perfectly happy to impose the sanctions if the meeting with xi did not go well

important to diminish trade barriers and unfair trade tariffs we need to resolve the current trade tensions urgently within our multilateral framework and step up our efforts to modernise the multilateral trade system the he added bank indonesia deputy governor dody budi waluyo agreed that the trade war between the world s two biggest economies was having a significant impact on the performance of exports from smaller emerging nations like indonesia one of the major factors is coming from the trade policies of the big countries the tensions coming from the two countries you can

mention resolving global trade tensions then waluyo said while the overall impact from trade tensions on emerging markets was negative they also created opportunities for some emerging economies to fill us demand for goods and commodity exports that previously came from china but were now subject to high tariffs from the us i think indonesia has also seen some progressive performance in footwear exports to the us growing from 2 per cent in 2017 to 6 per cent last year he said waluyo added that indonesia would keep the tap open on the infrastructure spending it had started in the last couple of years to increase the competitiveness of the country chinese finance minister liu kun said on the ministry s website after the meeting that the nation was willing to work with all parties to

paul craig roberts paulcraigroberts org june 6 2019 support your website dear readers we live in a matrix of lies in which our awareness is controlled by the explanations we are given the control exercised over our awareness is universal it applies to every aspect of our existence in the article below i show that not only is our understanding of the economy controlled by manipulation of our minds but also the markets themselves are controlled by official intervention in brief you can believe nothing that you are officially told if you desire truth you must support the websites that are committed to truth the state of the economy paul craig roberts the story line is going out that the economic boom is weakening and the federal reserve has to get the printing press running again the fed uses the money to purchase bonds which drives up the prices of bonds and lowers the interest rate the theory is that the lower interest rate encourages consumer spending and business investment and that this increase in consumer and business spending results in more output and employment the federal reserve european central bank and bank of england have been wedded to this policy for a decade and the japanese for longer without stimulating business investment rather than borrowing at low interest rates in order to invest more corporations borrowed in order to buy back their stock in other words some corporations after using all their profits to buy back their own stock went into debt in order to further reduce their market capitalization far from stimulating business investment the liquidity supplied by the federal reserve drove up stock and bond prices and spilled over into real estate the fact that corporations used their profits to buy back their shares rather than to invest in new capacity means that the corporations did not experience a booming economy with good investment opportunities it is a poor economy when the best investment for a company is to repurchase its own shares consumers devoid of real income growth maintained their living standards by going deeper into debt this process was aided for example by stretching out car payments from three years to six and seven years with the result that loan balances exceed the value of the vehicles many households live on credit cards by paying the minimum amount with the result that their indebtedness grows by the month the federal reserve s low interest rates are not reciprocated by the high credit card interest rate on outstanding balances some european countries now have negative interest rates which means that the bank does not pay you interest on your deposit but charges you a fee for holding your money in other words you are charged an interest rate for having money in a bank one reason for this is the belief of neoliberal economists that consumers would prefer to spend their money than to watch it gradually wither away and that the spending will drive the economy to higher growth what is the growth rate of the economy it is difficult to know because the measures of inflation have been tampered with in order to avoid cost of living adjustments for social security recipients and the payment of cola adjustments in contracts the consumer price index is a basket of goods that represents an average household s expenditures the weights of the items in the index are estimates of the percentage of the household budget that is spent on those items a rise in the prices of items in the index would raise the index by the weight of those items and this was the measure of inflation changes were made that reduced the inflation that the index measured one change was to substitute a lower price alternative when an item in the index rose in price another was to designate a rise in price of an item as a quality improvement and not count it as inflation something similar was done to the producer price index which is used to deflate nominal gdp in order to measure real economic growth gdp is measured in terms of money and some of the growth in the measure is due to price increases rather than to more output of goods and services in order to have a good estimate of how much real output has increased it is necessary to deflate the nominal measure of gdp by taking out the price rises if inflation is underestimated then real gdp will be overestimated when john williams of shadowstats adjusts the real gdp measure for what he calculates is a two percentage point understatement of annual inflation there has been very little economic growth since 2009 when a recovery allegedly began and the economy remains far below its pre recession level in 2008 in other words the belief that the us has had a decade long economic recovery is likely to be an illusion produced by underestimating inflation indeed every day experience with the prices of food clothing household goods and services indicates a higher rate of inflation than is officially reported the low unemployment rate that is reported is also an illusion the government achieves the low rate by not counting the unemployed the economic and psychological cost of searching for a job are high there are the economic costs of a presentable appearance and transport to the interview for a person without a pay check these costs rapidly mount the psychological costs of failure to find a job time after time also mount people become discouraged and cease looking the government treats discouraged workers who cannot find jobs as no longer being in the work force and omits them from the measure of unemployment john williams estimates that the real rate of us unemployment is 20 not 3 5 the decline in the labor force participation rate supports williams conclusion normally a booming economy which is what 3 5 unemployment represents would have a rising labor force participation rate as people enter the work force to take advantage of the employment opportunities however during the alleged ten year boom the participation rate has fallen an indication of poor job opportunities the government measures jobs in two ways the payroll jobs report that seeks to measure the new jobs created each month which is not a measure of employment as a person may hold two or more jobs and the household survey that seeks to measure employment the results are usually at odds and cannot be reconciled what does seem to emerge is that the new jobs reported are for the most part low productivity low value added lowly paid jobs another conclusion is that the number of full time jobs with benefits are declining and the number of part time jobs are rising a case could be made that us living standards have declined since the 1950s when one income was sufficient to support a family the husband took the slings and arrows of the work experience and the wife provided household services such as home cooked nutritious meals child care clean clothes and an orderly existence today most households require two earners to make ends meet and then only barely saving is a declining option a federal reserve report a couple of years ago concluded that about half of american households could not produce 400 cash unless personal possessions were sold as the federal reserve s low interest rate policy has not served ordinary americans or spurred investment in new plant and equipment who has it served the answer is corporate executives and shareholders as the liquidity supplied by the federal reserve has gone mainly into the prices of financial assets it is the owners of these assets who have benefited from the federal reserve s policy years ago congress in its unwisdom capped the amount of executive pay that could be deducted as a business expense at one million dollars unless performance related what performance related means is a rise in profits and share price corporate boards and executives achieved performance by reducing labor costs by moving jobs offshore and by using profits and borrowing in order to buy back the company s shares thus driving up the price in other words corporate leaders and owners benefited by harming the us economy the careers and livelihoods of the american work force and their own companies this is the reason for the extraordinary worsening of the income and wealth distribution in the united states that is polarizing the us into a handful of mega rich and a multitude of have nots the america i grew up in was an opportunity society there were ladders of upward mobility that could be climbed on merit alone without requiring family status or social and political connections instate college tuition was low most families could manage it and the students of those families that could not afford the cost worked their way through university with part time jobs student loans were unknown that america is gone the few economists capable of thought wonder about the high price earnings ratios of us stocks and the 26 000 dow jones when stock buy backs indicate that us corporations see no investment opportunities how can stock prices be so high when corporations see no growth in us consumer income that would justify investment in the us when president reagan s supply side economic policy got the dow jones up to 1 000 the us still had a real economy how can it be that today with america s economy hollowed out the dow jones is 25 or 26 times higher manipulation plays a role in the answer in reagan s last year in office the george h w bush forces created the working group on financial markets otherwise known as the plunge protection team the purpose of which was to prevent a stock market fall that would deny bush the republican nomination and the presidency as reagan s successor the bush people did not want any replay of october 1987 the plunge protection team brought together the federal reserve treasury and securities and exchange commission in a format that could intervene in the stock market to prevent a fall the easiest way to do this is when faced with falling stock prices to step in and purchase s p futures hedge funds follow the leader and the market decline is arrested the federal reserve now has the ability to intervene in any financial market dave kranzler and i have shown repeatedly how the federal reserve or its proxies intervene in the gold market to support the value of

menafn asia times pakistan will have to implement a slew of economic reforms as part of the international monetary fund s conditions for a us 6 billion bailout these conditions are likely to be part of the fiscal budget that will be announced on tuesday by abdul hafeez shaikh the prime minister s economic advisor this means that the budget needs to reflect measures to stabilize the economy reduce non development expenses and bolster exports this will also be bad news for the pakistani rupee which has been in a free fall for over six months according to top government sources the imf wants the value of the rupee to be market determined shaikh will present the 6 8 trillion rupee budget for the current fiscal year in the national assembly on tuesday the incumbent pakistan tehrik e insaf pti government led by imran khan maintains that the budget would focus on revenue generation and growth while at the same time being people friendly economic reforms the announcement came less than a month after pakistan agreed on termswith the imf for a bailout package the three year bailout deal worth 6 billion requires an ambitious reforms agenda to address pakistan s financial woes islamabad s staff level agreement with the imf is conditional to the fund s proposed reforms being incorporated in the upcoming budget sources in the pakistani negotiation team say that there are clear instructions that the imf money will not be used to service any bilateral loans and debts from other countries this is an indication that the imf will not permit any part of the bailout to be used to service loans from china for the china pakistan economic corridor cpec or the belt and road initiative bri this has been a point of considerable friction during the negotiations finance ministry officials insist that using the imf money to pay china was never a part of their plan anyway nevertheless the pti government has been trying to re negotiate the agreements under cpec and bri with china but beijing is not keen to do so sources said the condition to make the pakistani rupee s value be determined by market forces was regularly reiterated throughout the negotiations with pakistan over the past year resulting in the rupeeintermittently retracingnew lows against the us dollar in the immediate aftermath of the agreement with imf last month the pakistani rupee plunged to anall time low of 155against the us dollar uncertainty over the terms agreed with the imf meant that the market was rife with speculation resulting in investors queuing up to hoard us dollars there was chaos after the imf deal announcement since nobody knew the exact terms of the deal dr ashfaque hasan khan a member of the government s economic advisory council told asia times what everyone knew was that the deal would be market determined so the market decided to take matters into its own hands once the final approval comes from the imf the exact terms would be revealed then we can expect the markets to stabilize he added after a month of volatility the rupee has settled around 150 against the us dollar which reflects a 43 plunge in the value of the pakistani currency since december 2017 in interviews with asia times members of the economic team of the then finance minister ishaq dar had revealed that the rupee was kept artificially afloat around the 100 mark dar decided to inject about 7 billion into the market this was done through the state bank of pakistan sbp and it helped prop up the pakistani rupee for a while however the artificialovervaluationof the rupee through this injection ended after dar left the finance ministry following the filing of corruption cases against him it was dar who had overseen the completion of the previous three year imf bailout package from june 2013 to june 2016 under the pakistan muslim league nawaz pml n rule after the earlier imf deal ended in 2016 the government stopped following its directions and that completely undid all the benefits that pakistan had gained from the bailout said former finance secretary waqar masood khan the fiscal deficit started rising immediately the external account deficit rose and reserves fell and even if you re perfectly treated by a doctor if you start neglecting what the doctor tells you you will end up getting sick again and go back to the hospital that is what is happening to the economy he added referring to pakistan s return to the imf deficit improves however the current account deficit has seen a slight decrease as compared with the same period a year ago it declined from 15 86 billion in may last year to 11 58 billion this year the reduction in the deficit has been largely achieved through monetary aid from saudi arabia china the uae and malaysia with a combined 18 billion in aid loans and deferred payments riyadh gave islamabad a 6 billion bailout packagein november in exchange for support following the crisis over the killing of journalist jamal khashoggi another 6 2 billion package from the uae followed in january the aid from allies meant that until february this year islamabad was actively considering the prospect of not having to go to the imf at all in this regard the finance supplementary second amendment bill of 2019 was specifically designed to avoid the imf bailout by april however with a current deficit still over 11 5 billion it had become inevitable that pakistan would need a 13th imf bailout the then finance minister asad umar led the pakistani delegation to washington to discuss the terms days after his return umar was sacked multiple sources within the ruling pti have confirmed that umar was removed because of the imf s recommendation his replacement abdul hafeez shaikh was also appointed as the economic advisor in accordance with the imf s demands given that shaikh had successfully negotiated an agreement with the fund as the finance minister under pakistan people s party ppp rule the imf bailout will only be able to regulate the payments that we have to make to the imf and other donor agencies said former finance minister rana afzal khan but that will provide some relief to the government and they would be able to focus on the internal dynamics they need to focus on reducing current expenses which khan described as a tragedy hard times ahead they have increased the expenses by at least rupees 1 000 billion rupees in the first ten months and there s a 500 billion rupee reduction in tax collection targets while we re looking for money from the outside we re losing money on the inside owing to mismanagement over the past 10 months which resulted in loss of us 10 billion and the borrowing of another 10 billion resulting in a cumulative impact of 20 billion he added given that a lot of the government s borrowing is local the central bank s interest rate hike has increased its fiscal burden last month thestate bank of pakistan increasedthe rate to an almost eight year high of 12 25 signifying an increase of 150 basis points asad umar mentioned in a recent panel discussion that imf had asked for a 600 basis points hike which would ve taken the interest rate to 22 the value of the government s loans owing to the fall in rupee s value and the interest rate hike denotes that the economy needs significant increase in domestic revenue generation this has prompted the government to launch anasset declaration schemeto increase the tax net similarly the defense budget which takes up a significant chunk of the finances is not being increased this year tuesday s budget is likely to see major reforms overseen by a team that has been handpicked by the imf whether this will be adequate to rescue a failing economy remains to be seen sign up for the daily report

us employment data came in worse than expected image credit 2006 getty images a couple of weeks ago us president donald trump decided the us was going to impose trade tariffs on goods imported from mexico that was a bit of a surprise as everyone had thought that they had agreed a deal already but these tariffs were designed to push mexico to take more action on immigration at the us border the 5

analysis plus money saving tips with our free twice daily newsletter sign up but on friday evening in the nick of time the day was saved trade wars your new reality tv show trump has pulled a trade deal out of the hat on friday evening he dropped his plan to charge 5 tariffs on mexican imports he said that mexico had agreed to take strong measures to prevent illegal immigration over the us border by coincidence the s p 500 the main us stockmarket index had its best weekly gain this year up 4 4 i m sure trump would like to take credit for this and certainly investors in other parts of the world will be pleased to realise that trump isn t quite as trigger happy as they might have feared however the rally isn t about trade for one thing there are plenty of suggestions that the deal was in the pipeline for a long time and that most of it had already been agreed as john authers notes on bloomberg trump has most likely stage managed it creating a last minute crisis on paper and then resolving it allowing him to look good about doing a deal that had already been done and as authers adds markets hadn t priced in much of a reaction to the tariffs while a trade war between the us and mexico would have been damaging lots of car parts criss cross the border on their way to the finished product for example it s clear that investors weren t convinced it would happen instead last week s rally was about two main things both central bank related the federal reserve america s central bank now appears much more open to cutting interest rates and that in turn takes us to a much more convincing reason for the friday rally some very disappointing data on us employment here s why the market loves bad economic news on friday us non farm payrolls figures came in much lower than expected the us added just 75 000 jobs in may economists had been betting on 185 000 worse still gains in both march and april were revised lower meanwhile wage growth came in at 3 1 still beating inflation but hardly rocketing the economy might be at near full employment but employers still don t appear to be under a lot of pressure to raise wages to find workers you have to bear in mind that the non farm payrolls data is subject to revision it s not a terribly reliable number it does move markets but all that shows is that markets are easily moved that said it s all grist to the pending recession story mill and the more bad news that comes in the happier markets will be right now markets want one thing they want the fed to cut interest rates or loosen monetary policy one way or another investors are starting to think that a july rate cut is a near certainty is that likely the fed of course is meant to be independent of markets but it also operates through expectations management if the fed disappoints then you can be sure that markets will react they want to know where the powell put kicks in and they will keep testing jerome powell the fed chairman until they find his breaking point on the one hand there are increasingly dovish noises from prominent fed members as gavyn davies highlights in the ft fed vice chair richard clarida has noted that he d be willing to cut rates as insurance in 1995 the fed under alan greenspan did something similar cutting rates by 0 75 over eight months an economic soft landing followed i get the impression that powell has no desire to disappoint however i m not sure that he fully grasps that the market likes the fed to be even more dovish than it expects and to beat the current level of hope among investors hungry for looser money he d probably have to cut this month or cut by 0 5 next month i struggle to see that happening we might have to see a proper slide in stocks first to trigger the fed s panic reaction the good news for investors is that they don t have to wait until the fed acts to get looser policy as authers again points out on bloomberg the us dollar is the single most important monetary indicator of the moment and measured against a basket of its biggest trading partners the us dollar fell by 0 5 on friday in all it had its worst week in over a year you can already see how this works the s p 500 has its best week even as the dollar has its worst week it s the same for most other markets the us dollar as i ve said many times before is the most important currency in the world almost everyone in financial markets needs it if the dollar strengthens you are making it more expensive to get hold of dollars therefore monetary conditions tighten across the globe if the dollar weakens the reverse happens monetary conditions loosen so all else being equal a weaker dollar is good for financial assets while a stronger dollar is bad for them the dollar is the indicator to watch right

the us dollar index dxy has rebounded slightly early on monday to trade around the 96 7 level at the time of writing despite the usd sell off that transpired following the latest united states employment report coming in far below market expectations despite shedding over one percent so far this month the current levels in the dxy will be attractive to potential dollar buyers the dollar has managed to show its resilience to periods of weakness several times over the past 12 months and investors will be closely monitoring whether it will be able to take this latest setback from the employment report in its stride what is more concerning for the dxy moving forward is that several us economic indicators in the second quarter have suggested that us economic growth momentum is cooling raising speculation that the federal reserve will need to cut interest rates over the coming months the us central bank may well intervene on its monetary policy settings to sustain growth in the world s largest economy which is on the cusp of reaching its longest ever expansion come july even though ramped up market bets for a fed rate cut this year have created a somewhat dollar negative environment those hoping for the dxy to capitulate may be left disappointed given the relatively weak pushback from other g10 currencies economic woes continue to cloud the euro s outlook while the pound remains mired in the brexit fog implying that these fluctuations in the dollar index could only provide little upside to other global currencies trade tensions are still seen as the most significant threat to both global growth and investor sentiment meaning that the dollar yen and gold will remain attractive assets for investors if the prolonged trade tensions carry a threat to the global growth outlook oil recovers as saudi arabia and russia appear to agree on extending production cuts brent futures are making further strides above the 60 bbl support level and on course for three consecutive days of gains after the saudi arabian energy minister expressed confidence that opec producers will prolong their output cuts programme through the second half of 2019 with oil prices recently flirting within a bear market slowing global demand appears to be featuring prominently on the minds of investors as the fallout from heightened trade tensions continues to be felt on the global economy the sustainability of oil s recent climb could be determined by the outlooks ofseveral key industry bodies scheduled this week whereby more downcast projections for global demandwill be used as a threat to prompt traders to continue chipping away atoil s 15 percent year to date gains risk appetite clawing back on monday risk on mode appears to be seeping back into the markets on monday with most asian stocks starting off the new week on a stronger note gold fell 0 9 percent and is now trading below the 1 330 handle while the japanese yen erased friday s gains to trade above the 108 4 mark against the dollar at the time of writing asian currencies however are mostly weaker given the dollar s rebound today s price action in asian fx once again highlights the narrative surrounding asian currencies which remains a dollar driven story even as regional economies contend with the headwinds felt from the heightened uncertainties surrounding the global growth outlook further bouts of risk aversion sparked by another escalation in trade tensions particularly betweeen the us and china could undo recent gains for asian currencies while severely curtailing appetite for risky assets

world economic leaders worry about impact of trump s misguided trade war president trump s tariffs are having a noticeable and negative impact on global economies the president doesn t seem to care doug mataconis 5 comments as we head toward the g 20 summit in japan at the end of the month the participants are preparing by holding preliminary meetings between finance ministers and other government officials from all the participating countries and much of the discussion is about the negative consequences of president trump s trade war with china global finance leaders meeting in japan this weekend said they were increasingly worried that the trade dispute between the united states and china which shows no signs of abating could propel the world economy into a crisis the sense of gloom at the gathering of the group of 20 major economies came amid increasing evidence that global economic growth is slowing amid president trump s renewed trade war with beijing in a closing statement or communiqué officials at the g 20 warned that trade tensions have intensified and agreed to address the risks but the trump administration intent on rewriting the rules of international commerce in america s favor gave no sign that it was ready to back down treasury secretary steven mnuchin continued to blame china for prolonging the fight and insisted that the trade dispute was not hurting america s economy or hampering global growth i don t think in any way that the slowdowns you re seeing in parts of the world are a result of trade tensions at the moment mr mnuchin told reporters on the sidelines of the g 20 mr trump is expected to meet with president xi jinping of china in late june a critical encounter that could determine whether the world s two largest economies can resolve their dispute talks between the two countries fell apart last month with mr trump accusing china of reneging on a trade deal and china insisting that the united states was not negotiating in good faith tensions have since increased as mr trump raised tariffs on 250 billion worth of chinese goods and threatened to tax nearly all chinese imports beijing has responded with higher tariffs on american goods and in a white paper released last sunday chinese officials vowed to never give in on issues of principle mr trump will make a decision about the next round of tariffs after his meeting with mr xi we are not far from a real and open trade war between china and the u s bruno le maire france s finance minister said in an interview on the sidelines of the gathering on sunday i think all the g 20 people are aware that kind of situation would lead to an economic crisis to a lack of growth and to a slowdown everywhere in the world mr mnuchin met on sunday with yi gang the governor of the people s bank of china it was the first face to face contact between officials from the two countries since the talks broke down last month mr mnuchin in a tweet described their discussion of trade as candid but he said he had no plans to return to beijing before mr trump and mr xi meet and that chinese officials would not be traveling to washington the treasury secretary who has shuttled back and forth to china several times in the past year said he had had no contact with liu he the chinese vice premier and top trade negotiator since early may policymakers from around the world voiced their concerns about mr trump s protectionist approach to mr mnuchin in hopes that the former goldman sachs banker who has been a more moderate voice on trade might persuade the president to back away from tariff threats and find a way to make peace with china mr le maire said he made this case directly to mr mnuchin and urged the treasury secretary to consider a multilateral approach such as working through the world trade organization to confront china he also noted that the steel and aluminum tariffs that mr trump imposed on imports last year have had a ripple effect compounding the protectionism emanating from the united states canada is also feeling pain as a result of strained relations between the united states and china last year canadian authorities arrested meng wanzhou the chief financial officer of the chinese tech giant huawei who faces extradition to the united states since then china has detained two canadians rebuffing canada s calls for their release it has also begun blocking imports of canadian canola we re seeing actions in china to restrict the trade of canola said bill morneau canada s finance minister we don t see that as something related to the quality of the canola but rather as a trade response to our legal system all the friction is taking a toll on many of the world s largest economies as businesses race to reorient their supply chains and anxiously await new trade barriers mr trump has added to the uncertainty in recent weeks threatening tariffs on allies like mexico to solve problems such as immigration that have nothing to do with trade this month the world bank and the international monetary fund warned about the prospects of slowing economic growth and both pointed to widening trade disputes as a culprit the bank noted that global trade growth has slowed to its lowest level in a decade while the i m f said that the tariffs that the united states and china placed on each other s imports could reduce global gross domestic product by 0 5 percent or 455 billion next year the trump administration views america s relative economic strength as a source of leverage but there are also signs that the tariffs are taking a toll in the united states in a survey of businesses conducted by the federal reserve in may contacts across the central bank s 12 districts mentioned tariffs 37 times up from 19 in the april report and 18 in march businesses reported a range of experiences some said they were passing along cost increases while others said they could not pecan farmers in the dallas district were considering shifting into hemp and away from their tariff impaired crop while clothing stores in richmond va reported that they had stocked up on inventory to avoid import taxes and could not place new seasonally appropriate orders it should not be a surprise that the trade war with china is having a negative impact on the world economy that fact became apparent shortly after this war began with the announcement of tariffs on steel and aluminum that seemingly came from out of nowhere just two months after the steel and aluminum tariffs were announced the wall street journal reported that prices for both foreign and domestic steel and aluminum were increasing and this was having a negative impact on manufacturers that rely on these raw materials for their products other reports have indicated that american pork farmers were increasingly nervous about their overseas business with nations like china due to the fact that beijing was threatening to hit american agriculture with retaliatory tariffs in iowa it was reported that chinese retaliation for the tariffs could cost soybean farmers 624 million this year alone with the prospect of larger losses if the retaliation continues beyond this year this has led many leaders in iowa and elsewhere including senator chuck grassley to express concern about the impact of the trade war on republican fortunes in the fall this is especially true given the fact that the tariffs seem to be expressly targeted toward trump voters and middle class americans in the time since then we have also seen that the tariffs have had a negative impact on other american businesses and has even led an iconic american brand like harley davidson to announce that they are moving some production overseas in response to the retaliatory tariffs imposed by the european union in august trump announced a new round of tariffs on chinese goods and the chinese responded immediately with another round of retaliatory tariffs finally and most recently the administration announced yet another expansion of the trade war and of course the chinese responded accordingly and it is american consumer and businesses that are paying the price for the president s ill informed trade policies none of this should come as a surprise to anyone with even a cursory understanding of economics going all the way back to the days of the father of modern economics adam smith it has long been recognized that trade wars tariffs and protectionist trade policies are bad for the economy and do not deliver either the economic benefits or the job and industry protection that they offer as smith and those who followed in his footsteps argued and as subsequent history has clearly demonstrated tariffs and protectionist trade policies actually have the effect of increasing prices for consumers making it harder for domestic businesses to compete in international trade due to the inevitable retaliatory tariffs imposed by targeted countries and benefiting certain domestic industries while harming those that would benefit from the lower costs and higher supply that would result from lower tariffs and more open trade this is something that is recognized today by everyone from paul krugman on the left to larry kudlow who apparently surrendered his principles when he went to work in the white house on the right there is also plenty of evidence to show that tariff increases have other impacts such as slowing economic growth and increasing international tensions this last point is emphasized perhaps most emphatically by the use of the term trade war because that is effectively what is happening when two nations start imposing retaliatory tariffs on each other such policies in the past have also increased tensions in other respects and arguably played a role in the tensions that preceded the many wars that once ravaged continental europe including world war one it s also worth noting that it was in part an american led embargo that led to the japanese militarism that led directly to world war two in the pacific in any case both in theory and in fact the evidence against the benefits of tariffs is quite clear to the point where nearly all economists on both sides of the ideological aisle agree that they are a bad idea and bad policy trump is likely to hear more on this when he heads to the g 20 summit later this month but it s clear that he doesn t have any intention of listening to anyone who questions his lifelong commitment to idiotic and discredited ideas about free trade one can see that in the fact that the president continues to assert despite all the evidence to the contrary that it is the country against whom a tariff is imposed that pays the tariff the reality of course is quite different tariffs are imposed at the port of entry and it is the recipient of the foreign goods typically an american company that ends up paying the extra cost of the tariff from there they must decide whether they can afford to swallow the additional cost or whether they will be forced to raise prices while many companies have initially responded to these tariffs by swallowing the cost it s clear that this won t last forever and that prices will eventually have to increase additionally whether the costs are swallowed or past along the increased costs imposed by tariffs make it less likely that domestic businesses that rely on foreign trade will be able to expand or increase hiring or wages the consequences of all this are all too clear either we ll see the united states and china reach some kind of a deal resolving their trade differences something that seems more unlikely by the day or we ll see an expansion of the president s destructive trade war with all the negative consequences that means the irony of that of course is that it could end up being the impact of these tariffs and the disruptions they cause to international trade that ends up being the trigger for the recession here in the united states that is destined to come at some point if that happens then it will have an impact on the president s fortunes in 2020 meaning that if trump loses in 2020 he may end up having nobody to blame but himself

restrictions on the contracting parties in respect of the choice of governing law as long as the principles of public policy morals or sharia are not contravened however in practice the courts of qatar are likely to disregard the choice of foreign law and apply qatar law in certain circumstances title transfer transfer of aircraft how is title in an aircraft transferred under qatar law transfer of title to a purchaser is effective from the time of the sale if the purchase price is paid unless there is an agreement to the contrary in relation to aircraft a copy of a bill of sale and

aircraft takes place following the sale of an aircraft through an aircraft sale agreement a bill of sale aircraft delivery certificate and aircraft certificate of acceptance the qcaa would normally examine certified true copies of these documents before it will issue the certificate of registration in favour of the owner however the qcaa may request notarised and legalised versions in certain cases or may require translated documents if the documents are in any language other than english or arabic registration of aircraft ownership and lease interests aircraft registry identify and describe the aircraft registry the caa regulations require the application for registration of aircraft to be filed by the person seeking to register the aircraft in qatar ie the owner of the aircraft

of association certificate of incorporation etc the corporate authorisations such as power of attorney or board resolutions and id copies are normally required to be notarised and legalised up to the

fees for issuance of a certificate of registration the fee may range from 40 qatari riyals to 550 riyals depending on the maximum take off weight of the aircraft the fee is payable to the qcaa by cheque or money order title and third parties what is the effect of registration of an ownership interest as to proof of title and third parties the caa regulations specifically state that the certificate of registration is not evidence of ownership of an aircraft in any proceeding in which the ownership of the aircraft by a specific person or entity is in issue the qcaa does not issue any certificate of ownership or endorse the information with respect to the ownership on a certificate of registration the qcaa issues the certificate of registration to a person or entity who appears to be the owner on the basis of the evidence of ownership submitted to it which includes the bill of sale or sale and purchase agreement and other related transaction documents registration of lease interests summarise the process to register a lease interest there is no separate register for aircraft lease interests the entry is made in the aircraft register in qatar the lease agreement is required to be submitted along with the documents to register ownership of the aircraft please refer to question 8 there is no prescribed form for lease agreements or a form preferred by the qcaa however under the caa regulations a copy of the lease agreement is required to be submitted to the qcaa and must contain the following points the continuing airworthiness requirements of the aircraft is ensured under the terms of the lease agreement the lessor and lessee are properly identified the aircraft is identified by the make model and manufacturer serial number under the lease agreement effective dates of the lease are properly identified the person having operational control is the lessee the aircraft will be maintained and the responsibilities for the accomplishment of maintenance and for keeping the aircraft maintenance records are in accordance with qatar s implementation rules on continuing airworthiness and the maintenance or inspection programme that will be utilised is approved by the qcaa apart from the above the parties are free to agree contractually upon the lease terms to the extent that these are not against public policy or morals certificate of registration

certificate issued nationality and registration mark of the aircraft name of manufacturer and manufacturer s designation of aircraft aircraft serial number name and address of the owner of the aircraft and name and address of the lessee operator of the aircraft if the aircraft is the subject of a lease agreement acceptable to the qcaa any security interest over the aircraft is not recorded on the certificate of registration the qcaa issues a separate letter confirming its notice of any security interest over the aircraft a separate engine registration certificate is not issued by the qcaa deregistration and export is an owner or mortgagee required to consent to any deregistration or export of the aircraft must the aviation authority give notice can the operator block any proposed deregistration or export by an owner or mortgagee the caa regulations require the owner to submit the following to the qcaa if the owner wishes to cancel the certificate of registration of the aircraft for the purposes of export a written request for cancellation of the certificate describing the aircraft by make type serial number stating the qatar registration mark and the country to which the aircraft will be exported and evidence satisfactory to the qcaa that each holder of a recorded right has been satisfied or has consented to the transfer the qcaa will notify the country to which the aircraft is to be exported of the cancellation of registration at the time of registration of the aircraft the qcaa normally issues a letter confirming that it will act on the instructions of the owner lessor or the security agent as the case may be in all matters relating to the deregistration as such unless there is a lien exercised over the aircraft by the operator the operator may not object to the proposed deregistration powers of attorney what are the principal characteristics of deregistration and export powers of attorney generally a duly authenticated or legalised deregistration power of attorney in favour of the owner lessor or security agent as the case may be would be enforceable in qatar and may be relied upon to deregister and export the aircraft from qatar in the absence of any objection from the qcaa or the operator as a general principle under qatar law a power of attorney cannot be irrevocable in nature the agency related provisions in the civil code relate to the issuance of a power of attorney article 735 of the civil code states that the principal may at any time terminate or limit the agency even if there is an agreement to the contrary however if the agency is issued in favour or for the benefit of the agent or any third party the principal may not terminate or limit such agency without the consent of such agent or third party as applicable the power of attorney will not lose its validity upon the bankruptcy of the principal if the agent or third party has any interest or benefit deriving from the power of attorney the deregistration power of attorney issued by the operator in favour of the owner lessor or security trustee as the case may be is authenticated at the ministry of justice in qatar if the deregistration power of attorney is issued outside qatar then it must be notarised and legalised up to the qatari embassy in the jurisdiction of execution and then attested at the ministry of foreign affairs in qatar cape town convention and idera if the cape town convention is in effect in the jurisdiction describe any notable features of the irrevocable deregistration and export request authorisation idera process not applicable as qatar is not a signatory to the cape town convention security security document mortgage form and content what is the typical form of a security document over the aircraft and what must it contain there is no form of mortgage document prescribed by the qcaa the qcaa accepts mortgage documents in english typically the mortgage document would refer to the obligations that are being secured under the relevant transaction documents as such the amount secured and the economic terms of the deal are indirectly referred to in the mortgage document security documentary requirements and costs what are the documentary formalities for creation of an enforceable security over an aircraft what are the documentary costs typically a mortgage document should either be executed at the authentication department ministry of justice if being executed in qatar or if executed outside qatar notarised and legalised up to the embassy of qatar in the relevant foreign jurisdiction however in practice the qcaa accepts a certified true copy of the mortgage document along with other documents for the purposes of recording the ownership of the aircraft and the issuance of the letter of understanding in respect of the security interest noted over the aircraft we recommend that the filing requirements be confirmed with the operator who is responsible for filing the documents at the qcaa on a deal by deal basis although the qcaa does not require submitted security documents to be either notarised and legalised or be translated into arabic it is advisable to have the security documents notarised and legalised up to the qatari embassy in the jurisdiction of execution and then attested at the ministry of foreign affairs in qatar to avoid any challenge in respect of the authenticity or validity of the documents before the qatari courts also note that any document to be submitted before the courts in qatar are required to be in arabic arabic translations of the relevant documents may be prepared subsequently through official translation companies if required except for the costs relating to the authentication or legalisation of the mortgage document no other costs or fees are payable in qatar for the time being security registration requirements must the security document be filed with the aviation authority or any other registry as a condition to its effective creation or perfection against the debtor and third parties summarise the process to register a mortgagee interest yes a security document must be filed with the qcaa to obtain priority there is no requirement to register the security interests in any other register in qatar article 37 of the caa law states that all legal actions taken in respect of an aircraft must be registered and approved by the qcaa this includes sale transfer lease and mortgage the process and the documentary requirements set out in question 8 will have to be followed to register the security interests over the aircraft registration of security how is registration of a security interest certified mortgages or other security interests are not registered by the qcaa on the registration certificate the qcaa issues a letter confirming that it has taken on record the mortgage or the security interests created under the documents submitted to the qcaa however the letter will not state the priority of the secured parties such a letter is normally issued fairly quickly subject to the availability of the relevant officer at the qcaa it may be possible for the deal parties to review a draft of such a certificate to record the transaction structure accurately effect of registration of a security interest what is the effect of registration as to third parties registration of the security interest including the mortgage will confer priority over subsequent security interests recorded article 37 of the caa law states that all legal actions taken in respect of an aircraft must be registered and approved by the civil aviation authority this includes sale transfer lease and mortgage security interests are not registered or recorded by the qcaa on the registration certificate the qcaa issues a letter confirming that it has taken on record the security interest it is also possible to make enquiries at the qcaa in respect of a particular aircraft the qcaa would by a return letter confirm whether any security interests have been recorded by the qcaa in respect of that aircraft security structure and alteration how is security over aircraft and leases typically structured what are the consequences of changes to the security or its beneficiaries under qatar laws the concept of trust is not recognised and such arrangement would be viewed as an agency relationship financing in respect of and security over an aircraft typically involves a bilateral facility or syndicated structure in a bilateral facility the lender would take security over the aircraft in a syndicated structure a security trustee or agent acting on behalf of the lenders would hold the security over the aircraft on behalf of lenders the qcaa would accept security created in favour of the lender in a bilateral structure or the security trustee or agent in a syndicated structure the security would typically include security assignment including lease rentals assignment of insurances and reinsurances and mortgage over the aircraft if there is a change in the nature or terms of the security then the security recorded with the qcaa may have to be updated with regard to the change in beneficiaries being lender s in the financing transaction by replacement of a lender with a new lender the civil code recognises the concept of novation novation is valid when the debtor agrees to the change if the procedure for transfers under the relevant transaction documents is followed and the consent of the debtor is obtained for the transfer in accordance with the transfer procedures then a novation would be effected from a qatar law perspective further the benefit of the security is transferred to the new lender if the contracting parties have so agreed as such if the relevant finance documents address the mechanism in which the security would be transferred to the new lenders or the relevant parties enter into a security confirmation agreement then the benefit of the security documents would transfer if there is a change in the lenders under the financing documents resulting in the change of beneficiaries under the security documents but the security agent or security trustee continues to be the same entity and holds the security on behalf of the beneficiaries then this may not trigger a requirement to update the records at the qcaa on the assumption that the transfer of participation will not trigger any amendment or update to any of the relevant documents in respect of the aircraft we would recommend that the operator is involved in this process on a deal by deal basis security over spare engines what form does security over spare engines typically take and how does it operate security over spare engines may be created as a possessory pledge over movable asset this type of pledge may be created over movable assets that are not registered with any government authority in qatar the possessory pledge would essentially be a tripartite pledge agreement between the pledgor the pledgee and the bailee in addition to the provisions relating to the creation of the pledge provisions relating to the care and maintenance of the pledged assets insurance over engines if applicable and the procedure for enforcement of the pledge will also be set out in the pledge agreement the description of the pledged assets such as engines and the location of the pledged assets will be set out in a schedule to the pledge agreement enforcement measures repossession following lease termination outline the basic repossession procedures following lease termination how may the lessee lawfully impede the owner s rights to exercise default remedies the owner or lessor will require a court order to terminate the lease unless otherwise agreed and take possession of the aircraft the owner or lessor may seek to rely upon the deregistration power of attorney and provisions of the lease to take possession of the aircraft however if the lessee or qcaa object and require a court order to be provided confirming the actions of the owner or lessor court proceedings would be necessary law no 13 of 1990 the law of civil procedure allows a creditor an owner of an asset or a plaintiff with a valid claim against a defendant to attach an asset in possession of the other party therefore in the event of a dispute over the right to possession of the aircraft to remove or export the aircraft from qatar then the owner or lessor or the security trustee as the case may be may pursue attachment of the aircraft by court proceedings in qatar an attachment of the aircraft may support retrieval proceedings provided a prima facie claim can be proved by way of documentary evidence such as the relevant transaction documents an attachment application would have to be filed in the courts in qatar along with relevant documentary evidence in support of the application if the attachment application is successful an attachment order is granted by the judge and sent by the court bailiff for attachment of the aircraft within 10 days of any successful attachment application a merits case for damages or retrieval needs to be filed in support of the attachment proceedings failing this the attachment order will be considered void enforcement of security outline the basic measures to enforce a security interest how may the owner lawfully impede the mortgagee s right to enforce enforcement of security is not unusual in qatar and courts in qatar will order the sale of the secured asset if the outstanding debt is proven and the security has been properly created it is important to note that enforcement is a court led process and self help remedies are not permitted the enforcement process may differ depending on the nature of the debt commercial or non commercial and the nature of the assets movable immovable listed shares enforcement involves the secured party filing a claim for the whole amount outstanding on a debt and requesting the court to both acknowledge the security and confirm the secured party s preferred position the property may then be sold and subject to any preferred creditors rights the proceeds of such disbursement will be applied towards the satisfaction of the debt an expert may be appointed by the court to establish factual points relating to principal and interest priority liens and rights which liens and rights will have priority over aircraft ownership or an aircraft security interest if an aircraft can be taken seized or detained is any form of compensation available to an owner or mortgagee the following are instances of liens under the civil code and commercial code article 280 1 of the civil code if the possession of a movable is with a contractor and the contractor has used resources in relation to that movable eg carrying out repairs and maintenance such person may refrain from returning the movable until such time as it has received full payment article 281 2 of the civil code the movable object over which a person is exercising a lien may be sold i if there is an emergency in which case the sale can be carried out without a court order and ii pursuant to a court order in both cases the request for sale can be made if the item may deteriorate article 118 of the commercial code if the full price of the goods sold has not been paid the seller may retain such goods under his or her custody until full payment is made and article 197 of the commercial code if goods have been transported the carrier has a lien over such goods until full payment has been received in view of the provisions above if repairs have been made to the aircraft or certain parts have been installed on the aircraft and have not been paid for and the aircraft is in the possession of the relevant contractor the contractor may exercise a lien over the aircraft until payment has been made note that the qcaa in its letter of understanding issued at the time of registration of the aircraft or security interest states that it will not record any liens until it receives consent from the owner lessor or security trustee or agent with regard to state s or government entities right of confiscation nationalisation or requisition of assets the government of qatar may at its discretion confiscate nationalise or requisition an asset by way of an appropriate decree under exceptional circumstances enforcement of foreign judgments and arbitral awards how are judgments of foreign courts enforced is your jurisdiction party to the 1958 new york convention with regard to enforcement of foreign judgments under article 379 and 380 of the law of civil procedure to enforce a judgment of a foreign court the applicant must prove that a judgment issued by a court in qatar is enforceable in the jurisdiction of the foreign court in addition a judgment of a foreign court excluding a foreign arbitral award may be enforced in a court in qatar if no court in qatar has jurisdiction in the dispute and the foreign court did have jurisdiction the parties in relation to which the judgment was issued were given due notice of the proceeding and were represented at the proceeding the foreign judgment is final and the judgment does not contradict any judgment issued in qatar and contains nothing that would be in breach of public policy order or morals enforcement of foreign judgments would depend on the existence of a reciprocal arrangement between qatar and the foreign jurisdiction for enforcement of foreign judgment in the absence of reciprocal arrangement it will be difficult to directly enforce foreign judgments in qatar with regard to enforcement of foreign arbitral awards qatar formally acceded to the new york convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards the convention on 30 december 2002 as a result the enforcement of foreign awards ie those that are issued from a seat outside qatar and thus subject to the procedural laws of a foreign state should occur pursuant to the terms of the convention under the terms of the convention the courts in qatar will be entitled to refuse to enforce a foreign arbitration award only on certain narrowly defined grounds set out in the convention taxes and payment restrictions taxes what taxes may apply to aviation related lease payments loan repayments and transfers of aircraft how may tax liability be lawfully minimised qatar has recently issued law no 24 of 2018 relating to income tax law the new income tax law which will replace the current income tax law law no 21 of 2009 the executive regulations under the new income tax law are yet to be issued by the ministry of finance until such time the executive regulations under the old income tax law will continue to be applicable

concept of interest and as a general rule interest on loans is not permitted in qatar pursuant to the provisions of the civil code in transactions involving non financial institutions however where financial institutions are involved the qcb under law no 13 of 2012 the qcb law permits licensed financial institution to apply interest in accordance with the instructions issued by the qcb the qcb law applies to financial institutions licensed by the qcb relying on the provisions of the qcb law the qatari courts have adopted a very conservative view in respect of interest or default interest that may be claimed even in circumstances when loans are provided by financial institutions in qatar in respect of default interest the view taken by the courts is slightly uncertain in certain cases the court of cassation has enforced payment of default interest at the rate agreed between the parties however more recently the court of cassation has allowed payment of a lump sum to the banks instead of amounts calculated at agreed rates keeping in view the principles of justice there is no concept of binding precedents in qatar customs import and export are there any costs to bring the aircraft into the jurisdiction or take it out of the jurisdiction does the liability attach to the owner or mortgagee in accordance with the gulf cooperation council gcc customs union outlined in law

that an insured or beneficiary is only able to raise a claim against the insurer and the insurer is liable to compensate the insured or beneficiary even where the insurer has reinsured the risks as a general principle of contracts the civil code states that a contract may earn a right for a third party but cannot prescribe an obligation on a third party as such when the insurer or ceding company is unable to make payments to the insured or beneficiary because of insolvency or bankruptcy a cut through clause would be generally effective and allow the insured or beneficiary a right of direct recourse against the reinsurer much would depend on the manner in which the cut through clause is drafted in the contract of reinsurance and should ensure that the rights of the insured or beneficiaries and the relevant circumstances under which such rights arise are specifically identified reinsurance are assignments of reinsurance by domestic or captive insurers legally effective are assignments of reinsurance typically provided on aviation leasing and finance transactions yes assignment of reinsurances are typically provided on aviation leasing and financing transaction and

rules of liabilities under qatar law would be applied except where a person suffers damage on land as a direct result of an aircraft in flight or an object that fell from such aircraft in which case the registered owner or operator shall be liable the caa regulations define an owner of the aircraft as the owner recorded in the aircraft register and reflected in the certificate of registration the lessor of an aircraft that is subject to a lease agreement would also be considered as the owner and may be recorded as such on the certificate of registration article 212 of the civil code sets out the general rules of liabilities in respect of damage caused by objects that require special care which includes aircraft article 212 of the civil code states that the custodian or guardian of such an object would be liable for any compensation required to be made for any damage caused by the object unless the custodian or guardian is able to prove that the damage occurred for reasons beyond its control where the lease agreement is clear that all such liabilities are those of the operator lessee of the aircraft such liabilities will not be passed on to the lessor owner or financiers of the aircraft provided that such parties are able to establish that they are not the registered owners of the aircraft and were not in possession or control of the aircraft or in any way involved in the

on engineering procurement and construction epc basis in maharashtra and gujarat eros international media share price was also in focus today the stock of the company hit a record low of rs 40 95 per share today after short seller hindenburg research in a report alleged potential wrongdoing at parent eros international plc in the news from commodity space crude oil was witnessing buying interest today prices rose after saudi arabia said producer club organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec and russia were likely to keep withholding supplies gains were also seen on news that the united states and mexico averted a trade war that would have damaged the global economy in the coming days members of the opec group are set to discuss whether to extend their supply curbs further president vladimir putin has said that russia had differences with opec over what constituted a fair price for oil however he said moscow would take a joint decision with opec colleagues on output at a policy meeting in the coming weeks note that within the oil industry there are signs of a further rise in output from the united states where crude production has already surged by more than 2 million barrels per day bpd since early 2018 that has made the united states the world s biggest producer ahead of russia and saudi arabia also crude oil prices have quietly creeped up this year oil prices have jumped to their highest level since late 2018 as you know rising crude oil prices have a big impact on the indian economy as it imports over 70 of its energy needs rise in crude oil increases input costs for dependent firms it also means rising inflation rising inflation means rising interest rates it also puts pressure on the government to cut excise duty thereby impacting its revenues we have already seen that happening research analyst richa agarwal believes that this has the potential to bring down sentiments in the domestic markets she further believes that if oil prices continue their upward march in a tight global environment a broader correction in the sentiment fueled domestic market cannot be ruled out speaking of crude oil vijay bhambwani editor of weekly cash alerts called the us president donald trump s bluff on crude oil in one of his recent articles here s an excerpt of what he wrote from 2018 us is the largest oil producing country in the world with 13 4 of the global oil output daily the usa has jumped ahead of saudi arabia and russia in oil output my question to every oil trader out there is this as long as the usa was an importer it made sense to push for lower oil prices there were tangible benefits in doing so president donald trump runs the world s largest debtor nation one that is gasping for export income and a strong dollar a firm usd ensures easier servicing and repayment of debt and vice versa so now that trump wants to export oil and earn petro dollars does it benefit him if oil prices were to go up or down so why does he tweet for lower oil prices to know more you can read vijay s entire article here crude oil what trump nation really wants in the news from mutual funds space as per the amfi data open ended income or debt oriented mutual fund schemes witnessed a 42 month on month mom fall in net inflows the net inflows for may stood at rs 701 billion as against net inflows of rs 1 209 billion in april the fall in net flows highlights market participants lack of faith in debt schemes following a series of defaults and downgrades that have hit the debt mutual fund space apart from the above fixed term plans continue to face net outflows as well in may the category saw net outflows to the tune of rs 17 9 billion as against rs 176 billion last month meanwhile equity mutual funds have seen a 17 growth in their monthly net inflows from rs 46 billion in april to rs 54 billion in may equity linked saving schemes elss or tax saving equity schemes received net inflows worth rs 13 billion in may in april elsss received rs 13 5 billion average asset under management aum of the mutual fund industry for may stood at rs 25 43 lakh crore 0 62 higher on a month on month basis also speaking of mutual funds note that the ghosts of the il fs crisis continue to haunt indian mutual funds more so when it comes to their debt exposure debt mutual fund managers have been facing a tough time due to tight liquidity post the il fs crisis the credit risk of their assets has shot up in the aftermath of the crisis so ideally to offset this rising credit risk funds should have piled up on risk free government bonds however it turns out that mutual funds have been net sellers of government bonds since the beginning of 2018 and the intensity of the selling has only increased in the months following september 2018 as a percentage of their total assets under management government security exposure dropped to 3 3 by january 2019 from 5 4 in august 2018 mutual funds playing with fire with steep corporate debt exposure here s what tanushree banerjee wrote about this in one of the recent editions of the 5 minute wrapup instead in the greed of marginally higher yields from risky corporate borrowers compared to g sec yields funds are piling up on corporate debt keep in mind that corporate debt papers are not only relatively riskier but also comparatively illiquid by exposing investors to such risk without their knowledge debt fund managers are doing them a huge disservice it would be interesting to watch out how things pan out in this space meanwhile we will keep you updated on all

following the wind down of the bull market of 2017 crypto is still undergoing some fascinating developments a key one that grabbed even mainstream headlines facebook s announcement that they too want to foray into issuing coins the crypto part of something facebook calls project libra and is slated to launch on june 18 facebook has a rumoured 50 engineers working on this project according to some sources familiar with the project if flurry of job listings is any sign facebook is not alone in this as messaging platform telegram and signal have announced intentions to roll out cryptocurrencies over the next year too this time around facebook is keeping its cards so close to its chest that it s said that even employees working in the same building don t know what s going on the team in the know about the blockchain project has a separate key card access despite its hush hush nature there has been quite a bit of information that s trickled out about the facebook coin such as 1 a stablecoin named globalcoin it s official facebook s coin will be called globalcoin while ostensibly a crypto the upcoming coin will veer quite far from bitcoin s modus operandi it s a stablecoin a type of cryptocurrency pegged to a real world asset stablecoins have gotten more in vogue lately as a response to the high volatility that plagued the crypto scene since its inception 2 no it won t be tied to the usd contrary to earlier rumours though globalcoin won t be tied to any one fiat currency but a basket of currencies as a way to minimise risks of currency fluctuations some existing examples of currency baskets include the us dollar index usdx a basket of six currencies the euro japanese yen british pound canadian dollar swedish krona and swiss franc asia is also in the midst of developing a basket which would include currencies from china japan south korea indonesia malaysia and singapore globalcoin has been compared to internal blockchain based payments systems like jp morgan s jpm coin signature bank s signet system and the blockchain world wire program by ibm some of these operating in the same field as 3 the crypto is likely to be used for money transfer according to bloomberg facebook is working on creating a cryptocurrency that will let users transfer money on the facebook owned whatsapp messaging app focusing firstly on tackling the remittance market in india whatsapp is a valuable market for the messaging platform as of february last year india recorded 200 million active users on the platform and for a while was the only recipient to the whatsapp business function india also leads the world in remittances with its diaspora sending a staggering us 80 billion back home last year the idea would be that users could send money to friends and family instantly using the crypto instead though for now and considering that it s in the midst of discussions with some regulators it seems like facebook intends to offer cashout options which would put it under some regulatory jurisdictions that have precluded many incumbents from offering the same it s been said that facebook may face difficulties selling this concept to india as the government is gung ho about banning cryptocurrencies however there may be a possibility for facebook to sell the concept to the nation s regulators if it is able to make a strong case for the overall service as a remittance service diminishing its association to the cryptocurrency world 4 a potential for cross app transfers in facebook s messaging platforms the crypto is designed to operate within the company s existing messaging infrastructure which includes instagram facebook messenger as well with potential for cross platform transfers the company is in the midst of a year long overhaul of its messaging infrastructure to connect three of its properties messenger whatsapp and instagram 5 there s talk of facebook becoming a bank right now mark zuckerberg and team have been meeting with financial regulators including those in the usa and the uk as well as western union to discuss operational and regulatory issues relating to globalcoin and understand how to comply since they are not a bank yet there s been talk about facebook potentially becoming a bank as value for the coin will probably be stored in facebook s bank accounts whether this is in facebook s plans will remain to be seen but we can safely say that if successful facebook will be storing tonnes of money more than it does currently 6 it wants funding from vc to help it build credibility facebook is not poor by any means and is likely able to finance the production of the coin in house out of their own pocket and yet the social media network is famously seeking to raise as much as us 1 billion for the initiative instead facebook seeks vcs more for their influence their involvement in the project could help facebook present the coin project as more decentralised and less like facebook is in total control venture capitalist tim draper has at least expressed interest in hearing facebook out according to bloomberg hedge funds vcs and other wealthy individuals are likely to invest as well 7 not facebook s first virtual currency foray astute followers of facebook s progress will probably recall the company s 2011 effort to launch a digital currency facebook credits it s said that the profitability of this early scheme had been questionable which ultimately led to the project s sunset two years later cynics also bring up the facebook gifts scheme launched in 2012 and put down two years after that according to techcrunch s editor at large josh constine facebook never found a way solve distance and localization problems to make gifts work internationally facebook messenger also has its own version of payments launched in the usa in 2015 and expanded into europe later therefore to many this new try by facebook runs the risk of hitting the same brick walls while this new project may incorporate the latest tech darling blockchain its results may not stray too far from its track record so far 8 it will be ran by former paypal president the cryptocurrency is currently spearheaded by david marcus formerly president of paypal in fact observers into the space had been waiting for facebook to move into finance when david marcus had been tapped to run the messenger app in 2014 david became the head of facebook s blockchain initiatives though the team is keeping mum about what that may entail some other high profile hires for what has been called project libra include mit s christian catalini as chief economist and swiss based foundation manager sunita parasuraman who leads the token project facebook also earlier acqu hired a british blockchain company chainspace opting to absorb its team into the company without actually buying its technology 9 facebook could be charging us 10 mil licensing fees to third parties facebook is discussing levying a us 10 million licensing fee for the priviledge of operating a node the social media giant reportedly reached out to dozens of tech companies and financial institutions to create an independent foundation that would operate globalcoin and if they take the offer each node operator will be given a slot for one representative at the foundation globalcoin plans to launch 100 nodes which is probably the logic behind the us 1 billion value offered to investors it s likely that the fees will be used to back the digital asset rather than pure revenue facebook may also be setting up physical portals for people to purchase globalcoin 10 globalcoin helped zuck and the winklevoss twins make up in february it was reported that facebook was reaching out to cryptocurrency exchanges about selling the facebook coin and one of the exchanges that could begin listing globalcoin is gemini owned by the winklevoss twins thanks to the movie the social media the feud and subsequent falling out between mark zuckerberg and the winklevoss twins is well known however zuckerberg and the winklevoss twins are in meetings to potentially put facebook s crypto into gemini s network according to forbes facebook needs globalcoin to be tradeable in and out of their positions which the winklevoss exchange gemini could cater standing as one of the most stringent and compliant operations in the world and an in with global regulators is cherry on top for facebook meanwhile the sheer size of globalcoin is probably a big pull for gemini and could help boost the platform s position in the market amidst stiff

dollar recovers broadly today while stocks markets rebound threat of us mexico trade war vanished after trump announced to suspend indefinitely the plan to impose tariffs on all mexican imports an agreement was made between the us and mexico on migration issue at this point there is no confirmation of bottoming in the greenback yet but with a key uncertainty removed it s more likely for fed to hold on to its patient stance longer to see how things play out thus there is prospect of a stronger rebound in the greenback staying in the currency markets canadian dollar is the second strongest as

stabilizing and is generally projected to pick up moderately later this year and into 2020 however risks to global growth remain tilted to the downside and they warned most importantly trade and geopolitical tensions have intensified the group pledged to continue to address these risks and stand ready to take further action however the originally proposed language of recognize the pressing need to resolve trade tensions was dropped nevertheless the group still reemphasize that international trade and investment are important engines of growth productivity innovation job creation and development and they will continue to take joint action to strengthen international cooperation and frameworks us mnuchin trump perfectly happy to move forward with tariffs on china if they don t want a deal on the sidelines of the g20 finance minister meeting in fukuoka japan us treasury secretary steven mnuchin us china trade negotiation is at a crossroad like that ahead of the december g20 meeting in buenos aires he said trump needs to see action to make sure chinese president xi is heading in the right direction regarding the trade deal mnuchin added that trump will make a decision after the trump xi meeting in osaka on june 28 29 g20 leader summit he also emphasized that if china wants to move forward with the deal we re prepared to move forward on the terms we ve done if china doesn t want to move forward then president trump is perfectly happy to move forward with tariffs to rebalance the relationship and if no agreement is made the end result will be that my expectation is that many companies will move their production out of china to other locations on huawei s banning he said what the president is saying is if we move forward on trade that perhaps he ll be willing to do certain things on huawei if he gets comfort from china on that and certain guarantees however he emphasized these are national security issues also mnuchin said he had constructive meeting with

the us dollar index dxy has rebounded slightly early on monday to trade around the 96 7 level at the time of writing despite the usd sell off that transpired following the latest united states employment report coming in far below market expectations despite shedding over one percent so far this month the current levels in the dxy will be attractive to potential dollar buyers the dollar has managed to show its resilience to periods of weakness several times over the past 12 months and investors will be closely monitoring whether it will be able to take this latest setback from the employment report in its stride what is more concerning for the dxy moving forward is that several us economic indicators in the second quarter have suggested that us economic growth momentum is cooling raising speculation that the federal reserve will need to cut interest rates over the coming months the us central bank may well intervene on its monetary policy settings to sustain growth in the world s largest economy which is on the cusp of reaching its longest ever expansion come july even though ramped up market bets for a fed rate cut this year have created a somewhat dollar negative environment those hoping for the dxy to capitulate may be left disappointed given the relatively weak pushback from other g10 currencies economic woes continue to cloud the euro s outlook while the pound remains mired in the brexit fog implying that these fluctuations in the dollar index could only provide little upside to other global currencies trade tensions are still seen as the most significant threat to both global growth and investor sentiment meaning that the dollar yen and gold will remain attractive assets for investors if the prolonged trade tensions carry a threat to the global growth outlook oil recovers as saudi arabia and russia appear to agree on extending production cuts brent futures are making further strides above the 60 bbl support level and on course for three consecutive days of gains after the saudi arabian energy minister expressed confidence that opec producers will prolong their output cuts programme through the second half of 2019 with oil prices recently flirting within a bear market slowing global demand appears to be featuring prominently on the minds of investors as the fallout from heightened trade tensions continues to be felt on the global economy the sustainability of oil s recent climb could be determined by the outlooks ofseveral key industry bodies scheduled this week whereby more downcast projections for global demandwill be used as a threat to prompt traders to continue chipping away atoil s 15 percent year to date gains risk appetite clawing back on monday risk on mode appears to be seeping back into the markets on monday with most asian stocks starting off the new week on a stronger note gold fell 0 9 percent and is now trading below the 1 330 handle while the japanese yen erased friday s gains to trade above the 108 4 mark against the dollar at the time of writing asian currencies however are mostly weaker given the dollar s rebound today s price action in asian fx once again highlights the narrative surrounding asian currencies which remains a dollar driven story even as regional economies contend with the headwinds felt from the heightened uncertainties surrounding the global growth outlook further bouts of risk aversion sparked by another escalation in trade tensions particularly betweeen the us and china could undo recent gains for asian currencies while severely curtailing appetite for risky assets
it is transnational corporations the stand ins of yesterday s british empire often aided by an enthusiastic national bourgeoisie that have robbed the ghanaian people of sovereignty over their resources their wealth and their future anastasya eliseeva new frame every year the vast majority of ghana s natural wealth is stolen the country is among the largest exporters of gold in the world yet according to a study by the bank of ghana less than 1 7 percent of global returns from its gold make their way back to the ghanaian government this means that the remaining 98 3 percent is managed by outside entities mainly multinational corporations who keep the lion s share of the profits in other words of the 5 2 billion of gold produced from 1990 to 2002 the government received only 87 3 million in corporate income taxes and royalty payments even in cases where the corruption of local governments does exist the amount of money pilfered pales in comparison to the wealth extracted by transnational corporations the dominant discourse propagated by institutions like the international monetary fund imf that control the levers of global finance blames the bad governance of local officials for the consequences of this plunder citing corruption scandals as the main reason for a lack of resources however the discourse around bad governance the idea that corrupt local officials are to blame for endemic poverty low health indicators education and other measures of national well being focuses on what happens with the 1 7 percent of the returns that ghana receives sarah bracking points out that the company would argue that the market value of output is not synonymous with their surplus or profits as working capital wages depreciation of machines and so forth must be paid from this however the figures do act as a good illustration of the low returns to the sovereign owners of sub soil resources as a proportion of their final market value which in africa can be estimated as typically in the region of between three and five percent but which in this case is lower about 1 7 percent holding officials accountable for their use of public funds should be a given but what about the remaining 98 3 percent of the returns generated by ghana s gold exports individuals are blamed fingers angrily pointed at corrupt governments while the nations they govern are robbed blind by transnational corporations it is these corporations working with institutions like the imf and the world bank that define the terms of this conversation these international lenders bury borrowing countries with steep interest rates and terms that grant lending institutions the power to determine and approve national policies national leaders of countries that fall into the debt trap are forced to forfeit the right to create their own policies for access to loans these leaders are then blamed for the consequences of policies and terms crafted by lending institutions a key form of neocolonialism they are also blamed for the vestiges of hundreds of years of colonialism that came before in some cases it is true that national leaders are involved in corruption scandals in others corruption scandals are fabricated relying on a deeply embedded narrative and lack of faith in national leadership in the global south despite a lack of evidence seen recently in brazil with the imprisonment of leading presidential candidate lula da silva even in cases where the corruption of local governments does exist the amount of money pilfered pales in comparison to the wealth extracted by transnational corporations in other words robber barons are blaming petty thieves for the consequences of their large scale robbery schemes according to the united nations conference on trade and development unctad multinational corporations offshore tax hubs result in an estimated 100 billion in annual tax revenue losses for developing countries vijay prashad of tricontinental institute for social research calls this phenomenon tax strikes or the idea that those who hold capital who are the masters of property have been essentially on strike against regimes of taxation they use their vast wealth to either hide their money or change tax laws to offer them increasing protections rather than using this money for the social good to invest in public services infrastructure health or education they use it to increase their own wealth often by inflat the stock market and various asset bubbles comparatively during a 2013 keynote address world bank president jim yong kim cited that corruption in the form of bribery and theft by government officials costs developing countries between 20 billion and 40 billion each year in other words by a rough calculation the amount that corrupt government officials cost developing countries is anywhere from 40 to 80 percent less than half of the amount that these nations lose in offshore tax havens the real power then remains in the hands of multinational corporations which not only make off with vast sums of wealth belonging to the darker nations but also continue to exercise control over nations in the global south where they use access to finance as a lever to impose policies that benefit themselves at the expense of the people who live there when local leaders are deemed too much of a threat to multinational corporations interests they are quickly deposed through coups as we saw in haiti 2004 and honduras 2009 or destabilization campaigns as we see in venezuela today when local leaders are deemed too much of a threat to multinational corporations interests they are quickly deposed through coups as we saw in haiti 2004 and honduras 2009 or destabilization campaigns as we see in venezuela today kwame nkrumah a leader in ghana s independence struggle and the country s first president referred to this process as neocolonialism the essence of neo colonialism is that the state which is subject to it is in theory independent and has all the outward trappings of international sovereignty in reality its economic system and thus its political policy is directed from outside nkrumah wrote in his book neo colonialism the last stage of imperialism through organizations like the imf and world bank former colonialists would strive for the general objective to achieve colonialism in fact while preaching independence fifty four years after nkrumah wrote neo colonialism the last stage of imperialism 1965 and 62 years after ghana s independence from great britain 1957 nkrumah s assessment remains as clear and relevant as ever the preferred words of imperialism have shifted but the underlying structure remains the same a system where an illusion of freedom obscures the power relations and where monopoly capital in the form of transnational corporations and lending institutions exercises control over the country s economic and political reality the narrative of today s neocolonialists blames bad governance as the obstacle to a better future in which ghanaians benefit from their vast mineral wealth as gyekye tanoh of the third world network africa points out in his recent interview with tricontinental institute for social research according to this trope the corruption of local governments is to blame however this narrative leaves out of the picture the pillage of natural resources and exploitation of labor by colonizers great britain in the case of ghana not only were the systems to process crude forms of minerals such as oil and gold not developed by colonizers but the country s reliance on foreign capital to buy and process these resources has kept the country in a position similar to its colonial status pre 1957 as nkrumah predicted where transnational corporations rather than the state of great britain keep the vast majority of revenues produced from ghanaian gold and other resources tanoh explains he entire system that was set in place since the 1980s to force countries to rely upon raw material exports and to become dependent on foreign buyers is what leaves countries like ghana with such a minuscule amount of the wealth taken from ghana s land good governance is not going to solve this unless good governance refers as well to the deep structural dynamics pointing a proverbial finger at those responsible for the distribution of 1 7 percent of wealth generated and framing them as the main culprits of corruption poverty and underdevelopment is not just reckless and irresponsible it is part of a systemic narrative that deflects attention away from the real thieves pointing a proverbial finger at those responsible for the distribution of 1 7 percent of wealth generated and framing them as the main culprits of corruption poverty and underdevelopment is not just reckless and irresponsible it is part of a systemic narrative that deflects attention away from the real thieves the multinational corporations that preside over the 98 3 percent of the remaining wealth it is intellectually dishonest to ignore the broader historical context that is responsible for the low returns of ghanaian gold to ghanaian citizens true bad governance is the appropriation of 98 3 percent of wealth produced by ghanaian resources that lines the coffers of transnational corporations instead of being returned to benefit the ghanaian people of the 10 top multinational firms that operate on the african continent only one vale of brazil is located in the global south of the remaining nine three are united states corporations three are canadian two are australian and one is british all are private transnational corporations in other words the gold that is extracted from ghanaian soil like the natural wealth extracted from across the african continent and global south is immediately handed over to multinational corporations almost entirely based in and controlled by the global north or at best by the national elite to be processed refined and distributed death rape and preventable illnesses that plague those who work in or live near the mines are rampant in the area where these companies operate as illustrated by tricontinental institute for social research s latest briefing though ghana won its independence in 1957 the vestiges of colonialism and underdevelopment did not magically leave with it under colonialist rule resources were extracted from former colonies like ghana to sustain the wealth of their colonizers wealth produced from gold further enhanced by enslaved or bonded labor quickly left the country promoting development in england while leaving ghana void of the infrastructure to develop or refine its own resources and leaving its people without access to basic services to accept the narrative on bad governance is to forfeit what fidel castro called the battle of ideas it is to let the powerful transnational corporations and the web of institutions that protects their interests from the imf to corporatized non profits and mainstream media define the terms of the conversation on development sovereignty and the lives of the people who inhabit the resource rich land it is to forfeit the control of ghanaian resources to transnational corporations the very thieves of the majority of the country s wealth under the false pretext that they are incapable of managing it themselves to quote gyekye the language of good governance implies that it is only the aberrant behaviors of the public officials that should be seen as corruption yet of course the lack of resources available to accountable public institutions makes it impossible to create or sustain meaningful domestic anti corruption mechanisms it is intellectually dishonest to blame local leaders as the main culprits for bad governance conveniently leaving multinational corporations out of the picture it is the vestiges of colonialism and its continued neocolonialist forms that deprive the ghanaian people of the right to process develop and manage their natural wealth and to be the drivers of their own policies in other words their right to national sovereignty it is transnational corporations the stand ins of yesterday s british empire often aided by an enthusiastic national bourgeoisie that have robbed the ghanaian people of sovereignty over their resources their wealth and

they approach the middle of their careers in other areas mid career teachers are right to say they can t afford to live on their salaries without picking up side hustles or commuting long distances

median rent or mortgage that s in line with experts recommendations for budgeting in today s era of teacher strikes and walkouts the analysis answers a key question can educators in this area afford to live on their take home pay often that answer was no because housing costs exceeded 30 of teachers salaries after taxes the reasons why varied depending on the community starting teacher salaries were low or teachers pay didn t increase much over time or housing was comparably expensive compounding teachers financial troubles are other costs the analysis could not include like student debt

at the end of april japanese emperor akihito stepped down emperor naruhito s ascension marks the beginning of a new era the question for investors is whether the new reiwa era will bring any more joy than the turbulent heisei era that preceded it in the decades after the second world war japanese growth was rapid by the time emperor akihito came to the throne in the late 1980s many were predicting the japanese model would surpass that of the united states the economy was dominated by close knit industrial conglomerates that enjoyed tight relationships with their lending banks and produced world beating exports capturing large global market shares the hype around japan was similar to that around china much more recently asset markets became euphoric with equity and real estate prices soaring in japan the late 1980s are now referred to as the bubble economy and it burst spectacularly the nikkei 225 index of japanese stocks is still around one third lower than it was three decades ago as markets panicked deflation set in growth went into reverse and remained unreliable even after it returned government debt soared to 250 per cent of gdp a banking and lending crisis was compounded by a demographic transition as the japanese population aged the word japan re entered the economic lexicon this time as a dire warning of the future that might face the us and europe in the aftermath of 2008 in reality the case of japan over the last two decades is more nuanced than the caricature suggests growth has been weak but unemployment never rose above 5 4 per cent while inequality remained relatively low japan is also a useful reminder that demographics are not destiny while the working population has been declining since 1995 social norms have shifted not only have people begun to work for longer but the economic participation of women has risen shinzo abe prime minister since 2012 has been determined to end deflation and set the japanese economy on a more sustainable path to growth what has become known as abenomics is sold as having three arrows monetary stimulus fiscal stimulus and structural reform although in reality the second and arguably third of those has been kept in the quiver on the monetary front the bank of japan pioneered quantitative easing qe in recent years it has doubled down with purchases of government bonds stepped up along with the purchase of equities to support the stock market and interest rates cut into negative territory although deflation fears linger japan has finally managed to prevent prices falling further japanese markets have responded positively to abe s push equities have risen by an annualised 10 per cent since abe took office the real disappointment has been the failure to follow through on fiscal expansion the japanese state is highly indebted but interest rates remain exceptionally low and there is no imminent crisis of public finance october s planned hike in consumption tax will unhelpfully dampen consumer demand but overall the japanese economy is in a much better place than it was five years ago and that looks set to continue abe has every chance of completing the escape from deflation as long as the external environment stays relatively calm the real risks to japanese assets come from a more turbulent global environment and a potential escalation of the us china trade war for now though compared to other developed markets japanese assets look relatively cheap read andy davis s investment report on the power of timing

governmentza image reproduced under cc licensing aud slides as chinese trade data suggests economy struggling economic woes come as aud grapples with soured rba outlook cba says aud to hold 0 70 ahead of jobs data but risk to downside westpac remains seller of aud looking for three rba cuts to weigh the australian dollar slumped into the new week monday after official data revealed a surprise and steep fall in the value of chinese goods imports took place last month stoking fears for the health of the world s second largest economy and putting the aussie under pressure again monday s losses beat the aud usd rate back from a two month high and helped rescue the pound to australian dollar rate from what were the lowest levels since the beginning of april although it remains to be seen whether either exchange rate will maintain their newfound trajectories china s trade surplus rose sharply during may thanks to an export trade with the rest of the world that rose by 1 1 in u s dollar terms when compared with the same period one year ago and due to a steep 8 5 fall in imports this drove the trade surplus to 279 bn in may from 94 bn previously the weakness in imports will once again renew concerns about china s economy especially given the complicated path in delivering a us china trade deal we look for further weakness ahead as indicated by weakening pmis among china s key trading partners says mark mccormick head of fx strategy at td securities trade balance data is normally watched closely by investors because it reflects real world supply and demand for a currency but monday s figures were useful for a different reason in that they appear to reveal a chinese domestic economy that is struggling in the face of president donald trump s trade war above chinese imports by category source capital economics china s economy has been creaking since august 2018 beneath the weight of white house tariffs on u s imports of chinese goods that are still rising trump lifted from 10 to 25 the tariff levied on imports of some 200 bn but there is another 300 bn of annual chinese exports to the u s that is also set to be hit with a 25 tariff for australia the impact of this tariff fight is two fold in that economic weakness in china has potential to hit demand for and reduce prices of australia s commodity exports the aussie also suffers from the trade conflict because of the impact it s had on the renminbi because the large bilateral trade flow between both economies means the two currencies share a strong positive correlation heightened china us trade tensions led to a sharp rise in usd cny says kevin xie an economist at commonwealth bank of australia a lower cny would offset some of chinese exporters pressure amid the slower global growth prospectsand worsening china us relations above aud usd rate shown at daily intervals alongside usd cnh rate orange the usd cnh rate has risen 1 2 thus far in 2019 and the aud usd rate has fallen 1 2 demonstrating the strong correlation between the two losses for both currencies since the beginning of the tariff fight have been substantial with the usd cnh pair up by 8 7 in the last 12 months and the aud usd rate down 8 3 despite this there is still scope for the trade war between the u s and china to do more damage to the global economy as well as to the renminbi and australian dollar at the same time the tariff fight escalated last month as the white house lifted tariffs for the first time since summer 2018 and now with each side deploying so called blacklists against companies headquartered in the other s countries it s on the verge of becoming an all out economic conflict the continued fall in imports underlines that domestic demand is lacklustre looking ahead we now expect all us imports from china to be subject to a 25 tariff by early next year says marcel thieliant at capital economics meanwhile china is mulling restrictions on rare earth exports blacklisting us firms and discouraging chinese citizens from visiting the us or studying there the upshot is that the outlook for trade remains bleak above pound to australian dollar rate shown at daily intervals monday s chinese trade data comes at a time when the australian dollar is grappling with the fallout from a darkening outlook for reserve bank of australia rba interest rate policy which has already seen the bank cut its interest rate to a new record low of 1 25 this year rba policymakers have been battling inflation that is below the 2 to 3 target for a number of years now only now the domestic and global economies are slowing depriving the bank of the increased labour demand thought to be needed in order to lift workers wages and generate higher inflation pressures financial markets are now betting the rba will cut its interest rate again in august and potentially a third time in november the overnight index swap implied cash rate for tuesday 06 august the date of the rba s meeting for that month reached 0 99 last friday which just below the 1 level that would prevail if the bank did cut again the november 05 rate was 0 84 a rallies should be capped by rba rate cuts in june and august and by the deterioration in us china trade relations but with ois markets already priced for a sub 1 cash rate by 2020 we see aud usd only down to 0 68 by sep says tim riddell a macro strategist at westpac above aud usd rate shown at daily intervals markets care about the reserve bank story because changes in interest rates as well as the outlook for them can have a significant influence over international capital flows as well as speculative short term trading activity capital flows tend to move in the direction of the most advantageous or improving returns with a threat of lower rates normally seeing investors driven out of and deterred away from a currency rising rates have the opposite effect westpac one of australia s four largest lenders has told institutional clients they should sell the aussie against the u s dollar because it s likely to fall to fresh lows before the year is out the bank forecast three rba rate cuts this year and noted at the time that not all of these have been fully priced into the aussie aud usd will continue to trade around 0 7000 this week as usd remains heavy however aud could briefly fall on thursday if the australian unemployment rate stays at 5 2 as we expect the rba believes that the unemployment rate needs to move below 5 to reduce spare capacity in the labour market and boost inflation on the flip side an unemployment rate above 5 will warrant further cuts to the cash rate in both the market s view and the rba s view says richard grace at commonwealth bank of australia

story caps a school year focus on the pressures facing american teachers to perform the analysis usa today relied on data from two sources salary figures came from employers who reported to the bureau of labor statistics occupational employment statistics program as released in may 2017 because elementary teachers are the most prevalent the analysis focused on elementary pay in the 10th median and 90th percentile in each metro the survey includes public and private schools other analyses of teacher salaries tend to use a single measure of pay usually starting teacher salaries or median pay both

live on their take home pay their pay was compared with the proprietary zillow rental index from the real estate website that measure starts with median rents in each metro and applies a three month moving average while accounting for outlier figures the analysis focused on rent prices because mortgage payments can vary dramatically based on local taxes interest rates and insurance rates rental

would have moved out of miami by now if not for my husband s additional income beginner teachers have an even tougher time affording miami skyrocketing housing prices combined with relatively low

country new teachers can t afford the median rent almost anywhere in the u s the analysis shows a point often made during recent teacher strikes across the country but that s not the full story it s not just pay no matter where they work or what they earn teachers feel disrespect despite widespread demand for higher salaries teachers in some regions are actually making ends meet especially as they approach the middle of their careers in other areas mid career teachers are right to say they can t afford to live on their salaries without picking up side hustles or commuting long distances

median rent or mortgage that s in line with experts recommendations for budgeting in today s era of teacher strikes and walkouts the analysis answers a key question can educators in this area afford to live on their take home pay often that answer was no because housing costs exceeded 30 of teachers salaries after taxes the reasons why varied depending on the community starting teacher salaries were low or teachers pay didn t increase much over time or housing was comparably expensive compounding teachers financial troubles are other costs the analysis could not include like student debt health insurance contributions and child care costs starting out teachers can afford few cities beginning teachers or those in the bottom 10 of the pay scale can afford to rent a median priced unit in

base around 3 000 students attend schools in the local district 83 of them are poor a starting johnstown teacher with a bachelor s degree earns 49 995 nearby homes are relatively cheap in part because the city has a number of blighted properties and public housing complexes as a result said nancy behe president of the johnstown teachers union many teachers own their homes instead of renting teacher

present adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure of our performance this measurement is not recognized in accordance with u s gaap and should not be viewed as an alternative to u s gaap measures of performance the presentation of adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non recurring items we define adjusted ebitda as net loss income plus a income tax expense b interest expense net c depreciation and amortization and d loss income on foreign currency exchange we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to investors in assessing our ongoing financial performance and provides improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that management believes are not indicative of our operational profitability and that may obscure underlying business results and trends however this measure should not be considered in isolation or viewed as a substitute for net income or other measures of performance determined in accordance with u s gaap moreover adjusted ebitda as used herein is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the methods of calculation our management believes this measure is useful to compare general operating performance from period to period and to make certain related management decisions adjusted ebitda is also used by securities analysts lenders and others in their evaluation of different companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry for example interest expense can be highly dependent on a company s capital structure debt levels and credit ratings therefore the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies in addition the tax positions of companies can vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the various jurisdictions in which they operate as a result effective tax rates and tax expense can vary considerably among companies adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under u s gaap some of these limitations include it does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments or foreign exchange gain loss it does not reflect changes in or cash requirements for working capital it does not reflect significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our outstanding debt it does not reflect payments made or future requirements for income taxes and although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced or paid in the future and adjusted ebitda does not reflect cash requirements for such replacements or payments investors are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons the company considers it appropriate for supplemental analysis

one major constant in the history of the global economy is that nations do experience economic recessions for over 5 years the liberian economy has been in a recession that has adversely impacted living standards across the country the causes of the downturn are cleared lower price and global demand for primary commodities the ebola epidemic unmil drawdown lowering foreign direct investment loosened fiscal monetary stance mismanagement etc by harry ar toe gkornean bsc mba msc ccms what is unclear and currently being debated rests with the appropriate set of changes to liberia s fiscal and monetary programs in response to the economic nosedive noteworthily these troubling economic conditions were inherited by the current administration whose responsibility is to shift the economy s trajectory upwards so far the administration is implementing programs leading to a shallower and shorter recession as highlighted in recent international monetary fund imf report on liberia some of the major milestones undertaking by the current administration include reforms in revenue generation sales of central bank bills standing deposit and credit facilities in the interbank market these measures will weightily contribute to modernizing the monetary policy framework fiscal and monetary policymakers have consistently echoed the lack of credibility and trust in the financial services industry in liberia one of the difficulties in effectively regulating the money in circulation and the exchange rate regime as agreed by experts and policymakers is the inefficiency of the traditional financial structure and regulatory framework substantial financial and economic activities are conducted outside the formal financial market and monitoring mechanism relationships are being established and nurtured between government and relevant stakeholders in the money market both formal and informal including foreign exchange traders encouraging the circulation of both currencies liberian dollars u s dollars within the formal transactional banking environment while this relationship is relevant a more evidence based and long term sustainable approach must be pursued endeavoring to build credibility in the formal banking sector with trust convenience and reliability in the formal banking system customers will seek to utilize the system for their benefits thereby ensuring appropriate and manageable control of currencies in circulation by regulators and other actors this article lays out a set of process and service changes to liberia s traditional banking structure serving as sustainable intermediate policy response to increasing liberians level of credibility in the formal banking system to achieve this end a collaborative approach that seeks to ensure organizational and cultural change in liberia s financial services industry must be pursued regulatory framework supervised by the central bank of liberia and includes the ministries of finance development planning commerce industries liberia telecommunication corporation and private actors in the technology and or telecommunication industries this framework will exert to achieve the following fundamentals significantly increase non cash transactions in the economy increase online and automated banking services provide value added and customer driven solutions efficient customer relationship management significantly increase non cash transactions in the economy recent developments across the banking sector have shown that the exchange of goods and services can be made possible and more efficiently through non cash transactions with the advent of e commerce point of sales pos transactions and automated teller machine atm services using bank cards visa mastercard etc the gap in economic activities between the informal and formal financial sectors are increasingly narrowing an increase in non cash economic activities plays a significant role in reducing commerce related risk and vulnerability it also increases the ability of consumers including the poor to timely access basic financial and social services this will eventually have direct impact on standard of living and poverty reduction commercial banks in liberia must begin to ensure that all customers are provided with banks cards and other payment tools that commit them to making deposits readily accessible 24 hours a day and 7 days a week this is possible through the development of a unified payment and settlement infrastructure including automated clearing house ach and an electronic payment system that facilitates the routing and settlement of point of sale and atm services automatic bills payment transactions and interbank transfers the development of an effective national payment infrastructure led by the central bank of liberia in collaboration with commercial banks and technology companies will efficiently facilitate non cash transactions and serve as incentives for expanding participation in the formal financial sector increase online and automated banking services the physical infrastructure deficit in liberia along with other structural impediments make it extremely difficult for customers to transact with banking institutions to address this difficulty commercial banks across the country by directive of the central bank must ensure that a significant amount of services are provided through an effective online and automated banking system most services for which customers would normally visit the physical banking locations should also be provided through an automated telephone system virtual customer servicing or through a responsive and secured online portal in addition to the added reputation that comes with offering valuable services the central banks must ensure that incentives are provided to commercial banks that provide effective and efficient online virtual and automated banking services to customers this should reduce the traffic time and cost associated with visiting a banking location while some traditional services may still require a visit to a banking location most everyday services must be provided painlessly provide value added and demand customer driven solutions central bank in collaboration with other relevant regulatory institutions must ensure that commercial banks provide products and services that add values to customers focus must be shifted from just providing financial products to providing services that enhance economic activities and make doing business easier affordable efficient for example business customers that transact in a cash handling environment must be afforded in a reasonable and affordable manner merchant services tools and point of sale pos infrastructure that motivate businesses to utilize the use of bank cards for payments efficient customer relationship management innovative customer relationship management is crucial to the service industry especially financial services in ensuring that customized services are provided for customers banks must commit themselves to becoming customer intimate providing specialized focus to the management of customer relationship very long queues at banks that keep customers waiting for hours don t serve as incentives to widen the formal financial sector banks in liberia must shift their attention from a transaction centric to becoming customer centric the ministry of commerce must work with stakeholders in the sector including educators to develop appropriate customer relationship management training as part of a professional development and capacity building programs customer facing employees must be adequately trained to satisfactorily meet the needs and aspirations of customers for the service industry in general credible institutions must be accredited to provide customer service certifications to customer facing employees incentives and penalties must be enforced for businesses in or out of compliance no person must work with customers directly or indirectly without a certified accreditation in customer relationship management or customer service management these recommendations provide a policy direction for the development of liberia s financial system financial sector development is a crucial building block for private sector development achieving these evidence based fundamental triggers will require an effective change management initiative across the banking sector the current course of the banking sector will be altered as reliability and ease of doing banking increase a solution is only good when it s implemented therefore a comprehensive change management framework that focuses on building awareness desire knowledge ability and reinforcement for these radical and sustainably benefiting impact in the banking sector must be implemented there are evidences of a positive relationship between financial services expansion and poverty reduction through the formal banking system ordinary liberians can pullout accrued savings or utilize less risky credit opportunities to invest in income generating assets adequate access to valuable financial services will eventually generate employment increase incomes and lift liberians out of poverty historically liberians without appropriate access to formal financial services are restricted to rely on a very narrow range of oftentimes risky and expensive services in the informal sector according to the international monetary fund imf depositors in african countries grew by five fold between 2004 to 2013 2014 financial access surveys amid these improvements there remain a significant gap amongst the banked and unbanked african adults a 2015 study of the role of africa s informal financial services found the following that only 23 of african adults had an account at a formal financial institution that about 500 million african adults don t participate in the formal banking system that only 15 of adults in africa have a debit card and there are 5 atms per 100 000 persons in sub sahara africa these datasets might even be worse for liberia considering our technological institutional and infrastructural challenges hence the urgency to ensure financial services development in liberia widening the formal financial services industry will entail addressing the underlying structural imperatives such as the financial sector infrastructure and products or financial solutions it will be critically required to ensure the removal of existing physical bureaucratic and financial barriers in the industry this process will serve as a genuine initial step in creating a viable formal banking sector in liberia about the author harry ar toe gkornean is an accomplished management

present adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure of our performance this measurement is not recognized in accordance with u s gaap and should not be viewed as an alternative to u s gaap measures of performance the presentation of adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non recurring items we define adjusted ebitda as net loss income plus a income tax expense b interest expense net c depreciation and amortization and d loss income on foreign currency exchange we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to investors in assessing our ongoing financial performance and provides improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that management believes are not indicative of our operational profitability and that may obscure underlying business results and trends however this measure should not be considered in isolation or viewed as a substitute for net income or other measures of performance determined in accordance with u s gaap moreover adjusted ebitda as used herein is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the methods of calculation our management believes this measure is useful to compare general operating performance from period to period and to make certain related management decisions adjusted ebitda is also used by securities analysts lenders and others in their evaluation of different companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry for example interest expense can be highly dependent on a company s capital structure debt levels and credit ratings therefore the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies in addition the tax positions of companies can vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the various jurisdictions in which they operate as a result effective tax rates and tax expense can vary considerably among companies adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under u s gaap some of these limitations include it does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments or foreign exchange gain loss it does not reflect changes in or cash requirements for working capital it does not reflect significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our outstanding debt it does not reflect payments made or future requirements for income taxes and although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced or paid in the future and adjusted ebitda does not reflect cash requirements for such replacements or payments investors are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons the company considers it appropriate for supplemental analysis

ryan brown a middle school teacher in bridgeport conn lives at his parents home 45 minutes away he is part of a national teachers group that s pushing lawmakers to consider offering housing subsidies for teachers to live in the city in which they teach robert deutsch for usa today teachers hustle to afford housing elementary school teacher stacie baur in pennsylvania teaches english to chinese students via skype to make ends meet jack gruber usa today in sunny miami bilingual elementary teacher mari corugedo has 26 years of experience a master s degree and a passion for helping spanish speaking students quickly learn english her annual compensation for those skills 64 000 plus benefits that doesn t go far in this popular coastal city where median rent has shot up to almost 2 000 per month and the median mortgage is almost 1 300 per month before taxes or insurance according to the real estate site zillow we spend a good 30 to 40 of our income on our mortgage said corugedo 52 i would have moved out of miami by now if not for my husband s additional income beginner teachers have an even tougher time affording miami skyrocketing housing prices combined with relatively low educator salaries have made the area one of the nation s priciest cities for starting teachers in the first analysis of its kind usa today examined salaries and housing costs for teachers all over the country new teachers can t afford the median rent almost anywhere in the u s the analysis shows a point often made during recent teacher strikes across the country but that s not the full story it s not just pay no matter where they work or what they earn teachers feel disrespect despite widespread demand for higher salaries teachers in some regions are actually making ends meet especially as they approach the middle of their careers in other areas mid career teachers are right to say they can t afford to live on their salaries without picking up side hustles or commuting long distances some of those places are only affordable for the very highest paid teachers and then there are places that no teacher can afford no matter how much they earn like miami loading a lot of people who have a passion for education cannot make it as a career said karla hernandez mats president of the union for teachers in miami dade county public schools we have teachers as uber drivers lyft drivers they certainly love teaching but they can t pay their bills with love what does affordable mean to gauge teachers standard of living usa today looked at salaries in the lowest middle and highest pay brackets in almost all the nation s metropolitan areas cities and their surrounding counties the data reflect the earnings of teachers in public and private schools collected as part of a bureau of labor statistics survey released in may 2017 areas were deemed affordable if teachers would have to spend no more than 30 of their salaries after accounting for federal taxes to afford the local median rent or mortgage that s in line with experts recommendations for budgeting in today s era of teacher strikes and walkouts the analysis answers a key question can educators in this area afford to live on their take home pay often that answer was no because housing costs exceeded 30 of teachers salaries after taxes the reasons why varied depending on the community starting teacher salaries were low or teachers pay didn t increase much over time or housing was comparably expensive compounding teachers financial troubles are other costs the analysis could not include like student debt health insurance contributions and child care costs starting out teachers can afford few cities beginning teachers or those in the bottom 10 of the pay scale can afford to rent a median priced unit in just 13 of the 291 metro areas analyzed loading the johnstown pennsylvania metro area is one of them the former steelworker town about 90 minutes east of pittsburgh is a distressed city with a low tax base around 3 000 students attend schools in the local district 83 of them are poor a starting johnstown teacher with a bachelor s degree earns 49 995 nearby homes are relatively cheap in part because the city has a number of blighted properties and public housing complexes as a result said nancy behe president of the johnstown teachers union many teachers own their homes instead of renting teacher pay varies in the smaller districts nearby but in one the starting salary is just 18 500 behe said which pulls down pay for the johnstown metro area in the usa today analysis loading new teachers can also afford to live in springfield ohio starting salaries in the school district are currently about 37 000 and rising to 37 789 next year plus the current contract gives teachers an annual bonus of 1 000 said kathryn richison a longtime springfield teacher houses in springfield are affordable she said that s largely because people aren t clamoring to buy or rent them many choose to live instead in nearby dayton or columbus for the big city amenities richison said loading how much should teachers be paid the average salary of a u s teacher was 58 950 in 2016 17 when adjusted for inflation that s slightly less than what the average teacher earned almost two decades ago even when benefits are thrown in america s teachers earned 13 less in 2018 than private sector workers with similar levels of education according to the economic policy institute the nonprofit think tank which receives funding from labor unions examined decades of federal data growing unrest over low pay sparked teacher walkouts last year in states such as arizona oklahoma and west virginia wages have continued to be at the heart of teacher demonstrations in 2019 loading have teacher strikes worked how a west virginia teacher s facebook post started a national movement americans support striking teachers their unions are another matter entirely poll says meanwhile education workers are leaving their jobs at the fastest rate on record according to government data first reported by the wall street journal both political parties have taken note republicans who trimmed education budgets over the past decade are starting to pivot texas gov greg abbott has announced a 1 6 billion pay hike for teachers south carolina gov henry mcmaster approved a state budget that included about 160 million for teacher raises among democrats running for president former vice president joe biden has proposed tripling federal money for low income schools in part to give teachers raises u s sen kamala harris from california wants to give the average american teacher a 13 500 raise or enough to cover the gap between teachers and other college educated workers that would cost the federal government about 315 billion over 10 years many mid career teachers need a side hustle for now just under half of the metropolitan areas studied 135 are affordable for teachers earning a median wage loading for teachers in the rest of the country the hustle continues year after year in the clairton school district in western pennsylvania fifth grade teacher stacie baur earns about 43 100 per year her bachelor s and master s degrees saddled her with 130 000 in debt for extra income she rises before 4 a m every day to teach children in china how to speak english via a video feed baur earns 10 50 for each 25 minute class during the week she ll teach four in a row before rushing to clairton on the weekends she teaches 10 classes each day baur and her husband live 25 minutes from clairton in pittsburgh because they like the city housing in clairton is cheaper but they found a great deal on a pittsburgh apartment for 850 per month baur 33 doesn t see herself owning a home or starting a family anytime soon we haven t been able to save for the down payment yet baur said it s hard to save when things keep getting more expensive these mid career teachers are still struggling in some areas teachers are struggling because their pay doesn t increase much even as they gain more years of experience on average in the metros analyzed usa today found that elementary school teachers salaries grow by 31 322 after taxes as they moved from the bottom to the top of the pay scale but in some metro areas teachers salaries increased far less than that in the districts around enid oklahoma a state where teachers went on strike in 2018 to protest some of the lowest pay in the country salaries start around 32 000 the top 10 of earners in the largely rural area are only pocketing 48 000 after federal taxes according to usa today s analysis in enid public schools salaries ranged from about 38 000 to about 60 000 this past year according to the state teachers union loading

that s all before taxes salaries for teachers in charter and private schools in the nyc metro area can be less partly because of those high end salaries a city that s legendary for expensive apartments is actually affordable for an individual teacher once he or she reaches the top of the pay scale teachers in the top 10 of earners in the new york metro area would need to spend about 28 of their salaries to afford the city s median rent according to usa today s analysis loading now consider baltimore ap statistics teacher jackie secor is in her 12th year of teaching in the baltimore

than i do she said education coverage at usa today is made possible in part by a grant from the bill melinda gates foundation the gates foundation does not provide editorial input how we did it this story caps a school year focus on the pressures facing american teachers to perform the analysis usa today relied on data from two sources salary figures came from employers who reported to the bureau of labor statistics occupational employment statistics program as released in may 2017 because elementary teachers are the most prevalent the analysis focused on elementary pay in the 10th median and 90th percentile in each metro the survey includes public and private schools other analyses of teacher salaries tend to use a single measure of pay usually starting teacher salaries or median pay both of which oversimplify the issue usa today s spectrum of pay approach based on percentiles was designed to account for the fact that most teachers make more money as they gain years of experience similarly examining pay in metro areas instead of states allowed reporters to differentiate between high and low cost areas even within the same state to further account for real life factors usa today applied the federal tax rate for single filers to each salary figure to estimate elementary teachers take home pay in each metro next the analysis aimed to show whether teachers could afford to live on their take home pay their pay was compared with the proprietary zillow rental index from the real estate website that measure starts with median rents in each metro and applies a three month moving average while accounting for outlier figures the analysis focused on rent prices because mortgage payments can vary dramatically based on local taxes interest rates and insurance rates rental prices were most inclusive of the additional costs that factor into housing the 291 metros analyzed were those for which data existed in both the federal salary and zillow data sets

washington times dc i ve been shouting from the rooftops for six months that the federal reserve is too tight on money and that this lack of dollar liquidity has cut into growth so it is somewhat vindicating that fed chairman jerome powell seems to finally coming around to that idea the betting markets are now predicting at least one rate cut this year and perhaps two here s the problem once again the fed board has stumbled upon the right conclusion for the wrong reason its rhetoric and tortured logic confuses everyone the reason to cut interest rate targets and the interest the fed pays on bank reserves is that prices are falling for most commodities and many consumer goods for four months running the inflation rate has been below the fed s own stated target of 2 percent the lower interest rates on some longer term bonds than shorter term bonds the so called inverted yield curve is not a signal of recession but of deflation worries by investors but fed chairman powell and others on the board of governors keep saying that they feel compelled to cut interest rates to reverse the negative economic impact of tariffs and because economic growth may be slowing yes tariffs are hurting the economy and yes the growth rate for the second quarter of 2019 is now estimated to be running at less than 2 percent that s concerning as my former colleague at the wall street journal george melloan pointed out last week the fed can t undo the damage of tariffs by printing money so it shouldn t try as larry kudlow the president s chief economist puts it the fed can print money but it can t print jobs too many economists inside and outside the fed still don t get this just last week larry summers the former chief economist for presidents bill clinton and barack obama argued that the fed should weigh the benefits of supporting the economy need to be weighed against the risks of allowing inflation in other words he believes there is an inflation employment trade off this cockamamie phillips curve illogic that too much growth causes inflation and that the cure for slow growth is printing more money just won t go away that s why we continually see bewildering headlines that read growth worries spur the fed to lower interest rates all we have to do is go back to last summer when growth reached nearly 4 percent and yet this prosperity burst was not accompanied by higher prices trump tax cuts and deregulation have increased the supply of goods and services which means lower not higher prices the same thing happened after the reagan tax cuts in 1981 the economy boomed with growth rates as high as 6 percent and 7 percent and prices fell from the raging 14 percent inflation rates under jimmy carter to 3 percent to 4 percent throughout the 1980s the performance of the real economy is dictated by policy changes technology innovation labor force growth and so on the fed interest rate changes and open market operations control the price levels not real economic output the fed economists are fixated on the belief that by simply printing money it can increase growth which is plainly and dangerously wrong this is what the fed tried to do to reduce unemployment in the 1970s and we didnt get jobs we got the runaway inflation more recently venezuela and zimbabwe have tried to create prosperity by printing money and it only added to their economic miseries so yes the fed should cut rates now and it should have done so months ago because prices are falling in many sectors better late than never there is no sign of inflation anywhere in the economy today restoring stable prices by increasing dollar liquidity at a time when the whole globe wants dollars can erase the threat of deflation and raise growth rates by as much as half a percentage point which is a lot since most of the rest of the world is effectively pegged to the dollar a more stable dollar will help stimulate moribund growth rates in nations around the globe mr trump is right to try to drain the fed board of economists who are still peddling dead keynesian ideas about money sound money and a stable dollar on top of the prosperity enhancing effects of deregulation and tax cuts can give us 3 percent to 4 percent growth with no inflation for as far as the eye can see just what is jerome powell so afraid of stephen moore a columnist for the washington times is a visiting fellow in economics at the heritage foundation and an economic consultant with freedom works

washington federal reserve chairman jerome powell calls slumping inflation one of the major challenges our time shawn smith who trains some of the nation s most vulnerable low income workers sees it differently the people in smith s world don t want higher prices even slight increases make a huge difference to someone who is living on a limited income smith who s the director of workforce development at goodwill of central and coastal virginia said at a recent richmond fed event whether it is a 50 cents here or 10 cents there they are managing their dollars day to day and trying to figure out how to make it all work he said the social and business risks from the fed pursuing a slightly higher rate of inflation is a constant theme officials have heard in their 2019 strategy tour called fed listens it s a multi city outreach effort by the central bank that hit chicago this week fed governor lael brainard who met smith at a one such event in richmond got additional feedback from community leaders tuesday at the chicago fed conference when she chaired a panel on full employment advertisement i have heard a lot about price stability and fiscal sustainability from the fed for a very very long time patrick dujakovich president of the greater kansas city afl cio told the audience in chicago maybe i wasn t listening but today is the first time i ve heard about employment sustainability and employment security u s central bankers are struggling with a problem already faced by many central banks around the world aging demographics less capital intensive forms of investment and unusually low inflation mean interest rates are stuck at low levels if a recession hits they will probably have to cut rates to zero and resume crisis era measures like bond purchases that remain politically controversial the fed hasn t committed to any change but one idea that is getting some air time among officials is something called average inflation targeting or pursuing higher inflation for a while to make up for undershoots of the 2 percent target inflation has averaged just 1 5 percent since the expansion that began in 2009 a 2 percent target for inflation has been adopted by a number of central banks because it s seen as low enough to deliver price stability without being so low as to risk tipping into harmful deflation the story emerging in the fed listening sessions is that a strategy seeking higher inflation hits the most vulnerable part of the population hard the sometimes positive impacts of inflation for certain of us have no good benefits for people at the lower end of the spectrum stuart comstock gay president of delaware community foundation told an audience at the philadelphia fed that included its president patrick harker and fed board vice chairman richard clarida even some former fed economists say temporarily pursuing higher inflation obscures the real problem the central bank needs to discuss that the fed has limited tools to stimulate the economy once it cuts rates to zero the fed and other central banks need to make sure they can foster the recovery from a severe adverse shock said andrew levin who s now a dartmouth college professor but the answer is not to push inflation higher levin warns elevated inflation would be particularly burdensome for lower income families advertisement other economists have arrived at similar conclusions using bar code data to track actual household consumption and prices university of chicago economist greg kaplan found that the cumulative inflation rate was 8 to 9 percentage points lower for households with incomes above 100 000 versus those with incomes below 20 000 over the 2004 2012 period during that time inflation averaged 2 2 percent which would be in the range of what fed officials are now discussing as a possible strategy when inflation accelerates the lowest income cohort experiences higher inflation than the highest income group mingzi yi u s and canada economist at bank of america wrote in a report thursday this is one of the unintended costs of allowing inflation to run above target but it is unlikely to deter the fed business leaders don t relish the idea of a higher inflation experiment either bobby ukrop the chief executive officer of ukrop s homestyle foods in richmond said while low prices make it tough to boost wages for his workers many of whom are first or second generation americans but having to manage more fluctuations in interest rates and prices just introduces more variables for his business he said during the richmond fed conference for alex costabile vice president of strategy at wawa a convenience food and fuel retailer the prospect of higher inflation means he ll likely hear more from customers he told a philadelphia fed listens event that his shoppers are very aware of the store s prices if we change the price of coffee we have a lot of complaints

amid the prolonged market downturn jupai will remain dedicated to executing on our three strategies to optimize our business firstly we will look to grow our real estate equity products more proactively we believe that real estate is an asset class with relatively lower investment risk compared to other categories such as consumer credit or supply chain management products the rising funding costs and current volatility in the real estate industry should continue to provide an excellent entry point for investors to gain exposure to equity securities from leading real estate companies given jupai s abundant real estate industry experience we are well positioned to identify the highest quality real estate projects for our investors secondly we will continue enhancing our risk control system we believe risk management capability is one of the most critical aspects of wealth management products and the key to enhancing investor confidence over the past several years we have improved our risk control systems across our entire product life cycle and in the months ahead we will further strengthen our quality standards for project counterparties thirdly we target to achieve incremental growth from our overseas business including development of overseas insurance products and collaboration with leading international financial institutions to meet the rising demand for global asset allocation from our customers with these strategies in place we are confident that jupai will be well positioned to seize opportunities as the market recovers ms min liu jupai s chief financial officer said in light of the challenging environment jupai has implemented various cost control measures including downsizing our workforce adjusting our incentive systems optimizing our coverage network and streamlining our business sop to improve our operating efficiency and profitability as we foresee an increase in operating expenses over the near term related to personnel optimization we expect to realize more positive effects from our cost control measures towards the end of this year first quarter 2019 financial results net revenues net revenues for the first quarter

ryan brown a middle school teacher in bridgeport conn lives at his parents home 45 minutes away he is part of a national teachers group that s pushing lawmakers to consider offering housing subsidies for teachers to live in the city in which they teach robert deutsch for usa today teachers hustle to afford housing elementary school teacher stacie baur in pennsylvania teaches english to chinese students via skype to make ends meet jack gruber usa today in sunny miami bilingual elementary teacher mari corugedo has 26 years of experience a master s degree and a passion for helping spanish speaking students quickly learn english her annual compensation for those skills 64 000 plus benefits that doesn t go far in this popular coastal city where median rent has shot up to almost 2 000 per month and the median mortgage is almost 1 300 per month before taxes or insurance according to the real estate site zillow we spend a good 30 to 40 of our income on our mortgage said corugedo 52 i would have moved out of miami by now if not for my husband s additional income beginner teachers have an even tougher time affording miami skyrocketing housing prices combined with relatively low educator salaries have made the area one of the nation s priciest cities for starting teachers in the first analysis of its kind usa today examined salaries and housing costs for teachers all over the country new teachers can t afford the median rent almost anywhere in the u s the analysis shows a point often made during recent teacher strikes across the country but that s not the full story it s not just pay no matter where they work or what they earn teachers feel disrespect despite widespread demand for higher salaries teachers in some regions are actually making ends meet especially as they approach the middle of their careers in other areas mid career teachers are right to say they can t afford to live on their salaries without picking up side hustles or commuting long distances some of those places are only affordable for the very highest paid teachers and then there are places that no teacher can afford no matter how much they earn like miami loading a lot of people who have a passion for education cannot make it as a career said karla hernandez mats president of the union for teachers in miami dade county public schools we have teachers as uber drivers lyft drivers they certainly love teaching but they can t pay their bills with love what does affordable mean to gauge teachers standard of living usa today looked at salaries in the lowest middle and highest pay brackets in almost all the nation s metropolitan areas cities and their surrounding counties the data reflect the earnings of teachers in public and private schools collected as part of a bureau of labor statistics survey released in may 2017 areas were deemed affordable if teachers would have to spend no more than 30 of their salaries after accounting for federal taxes to afford the local median rent or mortgage that s in line with experts recommendations for budgeting in today s era of teacher strikes and walkouts the analysis answers a key question can educators in this area afford to live on their take home pay often that answer was no because housing costs exceeded 30 of teachers salaries after taxes the reasons why varied depending on the community starting teacher salaries were low or teachers pay didn t increase much over time or housing was comparably expensive compounding teachers financial troubles are other costs the analysis could not include like student debt health insurance contributions and child care costs starting out teachers can afford few cities beginning teachers or those in the bottom 10 of the pay scale can afford to rent a median priced unit in just 13 of the 291 metro areas analyzed loading the johnstown pennsylvania metro area is one of them the former steelworker town about 90 minutes east of pittsburgh is a distressed city with a low tax base around 3 000 students attend schools in the local district 83 of them are poor a starting johnstown teacher with a bachelor s degree earns 49 995 nearby homes are relatively cheap in part because the city has a number of blighted properties and public housing complexes as a result said nancy behe president of the johnstown teachers union many teachers own their homes instead of renting teacher pay varies in the smaller districts nearby but in one the starting salary is just 18 500 behe said which pulls down pay for the johnstown metro area in the usa today analysis loading new teachers can also afford to live in springfield ohio starting salaries in the school district are currently about 37 000 and rising to 37 789 next year plus the current contract gives teachers an annual bonus of 1 000 said kathryn richison a longtime springfield teacher houses in springfield are affordable she said that s largely because people aren t clamoring to buy or rent them many choose to live instead in nearby dayton or columbus for the big city amenities richison said loading how much should teachers be paid the average salary of a u s teacher was 58 950 in 2016 17 when adjusted for inflation that s slightly less than what the average teacher earned almost two decades ago even when benefits are thrown in america s teachers earned 13 less in 2018 than private sector workers with similar levels of

present adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure of our performance this measurement is not recognized in accordance with u s gaap and should not be viewed as an alternative to u s gaap measures of performance the presentation of adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non recurring items we define adjusted ebitda as net loss income plus a income tax expense b interest expense net c depreciation and amortization and d loss income on foreign currency exchange we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to investors in assessing our ongoing financial performance and provides improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that management believes are not indicative of our operational profitability and that may obscure underlying business results and trends however this measure should not be considered in isolation or viewed as a substitute for net income or other measures of performance determined in accordance with u s gaap moreover adjusted ebitda as used herein is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the methods of calculation our management believes this measure is useful to compare general operating performance from period to period and to make certain related management decisions adjusted ebitda is also used by securities analysts lenders and others in their evaluation of different companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry for example interest expense can be highly dependent on a company s capital structure debt levels and credit ratings therefore the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies in addition the tax positions of companies can vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the various jurisdictions in which they operate as a result effective tax rates and tax expense can vary considerably among companies adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under u s gaap some of these limitations include it does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments or foreign exchange gain loss it does not reflect changes in or cash requirements for working capital it does not reflect significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our outstanding debt it does not reflect payments made or future requirements for income taxes and although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced or paid in the future and adjusted ebitda does not reflect cash requirements for such replacements or payments investors are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons the company considers it appropriate for supplemental analysis

there is little dispute that china engages in unfair and often predatory practices to protect and promote its domestic industries yet if the trump administration s diagnosis of u s china economic relations is correct its remedy has been roundly rejected most observers believe the u s resort to unilateral tariffs will fail to achieve its intended objectives and will harm the u s economy as much as china s furthermore this episode may have the negative long term effect of strengthening china s confidence that it will prevail in future bilateral tests of will in public discussion of the u s china trade relationship president donald trump has focused on china s huge surplus in bilateral trade 419 billion in 2018 as proof the chinese are cheating and raping the u s economy many economists have criticized trump for an overly simplistic if not erroneous fixation on the trade balance as the key issue in bilateral economic relations senior trump advisors such as u s trade representative robert lighthizer have instead emphasized a broader goal of getting china to address structural problems such as protectionism against foreign service industries state subsidization of much of the chinese economy state sponsored industrial espionage and acquiescence to intellectual property theft and forced technology transfer as the price foreigners must pay to do business in china this approach enjoys support from businesses in the united states and elsewhere that want to break into the chinese market to address the trade imbalance the united states in 2018 imposed tariffs sequentially on three lists of goods from china first targeting 34 billion in annual imports then another 16 billion and finally an additional 200 billion as the dispute has dragged on u s tariff rates have increased and trump now threatens to sanction virtually all imports from china beijing has retaliated with sanctions of its own and said it would raise tariffs from 10 percent to 20 25 percent on the roughly 60 billion in u s exports to china already being taxed president trump said he believes a trade war is good and easy to win virtually all experts disagree the international monetary fund has concluded that u s and chinese consumers are unequivocally the losers in a trade war the peterson institute for international economics estimates that existing tariffs on chinese imports cost u s families about 550 a sum that will rise to 2 200 if the administration raises tariffs to 25 percent on 500 billion of chinese imports as threatened another study reckons the net loss would exceed 2 2 million jobs if all tariffs continue and cause a sales decline one indication of the impact in the united states is the trump administration s payment of over 8 5 billion to farmers to offset losses resulting from the trade war and the promise of another multibillion tranche of aid goldman sachs anticipates an escalating trade war will trim u s economic growth by 0 4 percent and perhaps more if it impacts the stock market the u s chamber of commerce has forecast a 1 trillion loss if the trade war continues for a decade china is being hurt too food price inflation has jumped substantially since the trade war began there is anecdotal evidence of workers being laid off and consumer spending declining according to simulations by japan s institute of developing economies in a trade war that lasts for three years and includes 25 percent additional tariffs on all goods imported from each other the u s economy will take a 0 4 percent hit china s is bigger at 0 6 percent contrary to president trump s claims it will not be easy to get china to substantially dismantle its unfair trade and investment policies through the imposition of tariffs in fact it will be extremely difficult meeting u s demands for structural change would compromise some of the principal levers by which the chinese communist party manages its monopoly over political power in china maintaining party control over society is one area where chinese leaders do not compromise as the world saw all too clearly thirty years ago xi must worry about preserving his image at home as the protector of chinese interests and honor in a dispute where most chinese believe u s demands are unfair and simply reflect u s unwillingness to accept chinese success xi likely has the burden of higher public expectations that he will win a dispute with the united states than his predecessors had he presides over the era of a post deng assertive china that its citizens increasingly presume will prevail when challenged by foreigners the personality cult that he has cultivated since taking power makes losses in foreign policy battles even more glaring accordingly the chinese government is mobilizing for tough resistance while the official chinese government reaction is to downplay the impact of the trade fight typical is a comment by wang zhijun vice minister of the ministry of industry and information technology who insists that the impact of the u s tariffs will be manageable other government actions suggest otherwise the central bank continues to cut bank reserve requirements to ensure that lenders have money to lend if the economy turns downward beijing has established a special task force the state council employment work leading group to monitor job losses resulting from the trade war the ministry of commerce announced that it was developing an unreliable entity list of foreign entities and individuals that are deemed to have damaged chinese firms or posed a threat to national security the threat to cut off rare earths exports so far only mooted in media such as the people s daily is a clear signal of the seriousness of the situation many u s businesses in china report they are suffering from administrative harassment a common tactic of chinese officialdom as a consequence of the tariff war in contrast to trump s false assurances to the u s public the chinese government is preparing its own people for hardship and explaining the necessity of a protracted national struggle against the united states the rhetoric of vice foreign minister zhang hanhui hits all the right buttons when he calls the u s actions naked economic terrorism economic chauvinism and economic bullying that echoes president xi jinping s call for a new long march in a recent appearance at a rare earths processing facility no less to rally the nation against a foreign bully and if that was too subtle state television has been showing patriotic movies about the korean war when china last defeated u s aggressors a xinhua editorial reminded readers that the chinese are people who have a great spirit of struggle history has shown that hardships only strengthen the chinese people s determination to fight and hone their ability to win let it be clear that no outside forces can stop china from reaching the chinese dream of national rejuvenation the patriotic bloviations of the chinese media highlight the psychological warfare advantage that beijing enjoys as an authoritarian state with a controlled press that serves the government s agenda the u s media freely reports on how tariffs are hurting americans while there is nothing comparable from the chinese side a people s daily editorial notes that washington s reckless leap in the dark has been poured with strong opposition and condemnation from domestic society the american soybean association american apparel footwear association the u s consumer technology association the national retail federation and other walks of life warned that it would roil the markets hurt the interests of consumers workers farmers and companies and severely jeopardize us economy ultimately the tariff war is largely about which of the two sides can best endure the pain both are suffering china s is largely hidden while america s is so openly and abundantly discussed as to feed national demoralization china can be expected to use trump s goal of re election in 2020 to lure him into a settlement that is comparatively painless for beijing look for the crisis to end with china meeting the minimal u s demand addressing trump s main concern by promising to buy a couple hundred billion dollars of additional u s exports and insincerely promising to look into the structural issues this would allow trump to pocket a quick victory prior to the 2020 vote call a truce in the trade war and return to business as usual that would allow beijing to ignore demands that it privatize its economy open decisively to foreign competition in now protected sectors and give up the practice of stealing or extorting advanced technology the trump administration was right to confront china s systematic economic predation but its chosen approach has little chance of meaningful success worse beijing could well emerge from this experience convinced that the united states is unable to stand up for its own interests because of the irresistible appeal of the chinese market and the inability of americans to endure even short term hardship this outcome would likely reinforce the chinese view of the united states as a weakening and dysfunctional country also it would amplify beijing s boldness in challenging washington across a range of issues the only real hope for u s success is a policy adjustment that is possible in theory but difficult in practice washington must forego unilateral sanctions against china and instead concentrate on building a multilateral coalition that hammers away at unfair chinese trade practices only a united front of major trading nations has any hope of permanently and meaningfully altering chinese behavior and that is still a long shot the trump administration would have to abandon its misguided assaults on major partners like the eu japan mexico and canada it would have to resort to multilateral diplomacy and have some faith in international institutions such as the world trade organization every one of these recommendations runs counter to the instincts of this administration and a failure to check those impulses could result in far greater damage to the united states
