the turquoise paint is peeling from the walls of claudia veronica genovesi s modest home her roof leaks but she and her husband both office cleaners cannot afford to patch it on the ragged streets of the shantytown across the road where stinking outhouses sit alongside shacks fashioned from rusted sheets of tin families have surrendered hopes that sewage lines will ever reach them they do not struggle to fashion an explanation for their declining fortunes since taking office more than three years ago president mauricio macri has broken with the budget busting populism that has dominated argentina for much of the past century embracing the grim arithmetic of economic orthodoxy macri has slashed subsidies for electricity fuel and transportation causing prices to skyrocket and recently prompting genovesi 48 to cut off her gas service rendering her stove lifeless like most of her neighbours she illegally taps into the power lines that run along the rutted dirt streets it s a neoliberal government she says it s a government that does not favour the people the tribulations playing out under the disintegrating roofs of the poor are a predictable dimension of macri s turn away from left wing populism he vowed to shrink argentina s monumental deficits by diminishing the largess of the state the trouble is that argentines have yet to collect on the other element the president promised the economic revival that was supposed to follow the pain macri s supporters heralded his 2015 election as a miraculous outbreak of normalcy in a country with a well earned reputation for histrionics he would cease the reckless spending that had brought argentina infamy for defaulting on its debts eight times sober minded austerity would win the trust of international financiers bringing investment that would yield jobs and fresh opportunities but as macri seeks re election this year argentines increasingly lament that they are absorbing all strife and no progress even businesses that have benefited from his reforms complain that he has botched the execution leaving the nation to confront the same concoction of misery that has plagued it for decades the economy is contracting inflation is running above 50 per cent and joblessness is stuck above 9 per cent poverty afflicts a third of the population and the figure is climbing a man wrapped in an argentine flag with text in spanish i did not vote for him protests against the government of mauricio macri and his economic policy in buenos aires last year photo ap far beyond this country of 44 million people macri s tenure is testing ideas that will shape economic policy in an age of recrimination over widening inequality his presidency was supposed to offer an escape from the wreckage of profligate spending while laying down an alternative path for countries grappling with the worldwide rise of populism now his presidency threatens to become a gateway back to populism as the october election approaches macri is contending with the growing prospect of a challenge from the president he succeeded cristina fernández who faces a series of criminal indictments for corruption her unbridled spending helped deliver the crisis that macri inherited her return would resonate as a rebuke of his market oriented reforms while potentially yanking argentina back to its accustomed preserve left wing populism in uncomfortable proximity to insolvency the argentine peso lost half its value against the dollar last year prompting the central bank to lift interest rates to a commerce suffocating level above 60 per cent argentina was forced to secure a us 57 billion 86 4b rescue from the international monetary fund a profound indignity given that the fund is widely despised here for the austerity it imposed in the late 1990s turning an economic downturn into a depression for macri time does not appear to be in abundant supply the spending cuts he delivered hit the populace immediately the promised benefits of his reforms a stable currency tamer inflation fresh investment and jobs could take years to materialise leaving argentines angry and yearning for the past in much of south america left wing governments have taken power in recent decades as an angry corrective to dogmatic prescriptions from washington where the treasury and the imf have focused on the confidence of global investors as the key to development left wing populism has aimed to redistribute the gains from the wealthy to everyone else it has aided the poor while generating its own woes corruption and depression in brazil runaway inflation and financial ruin in argentina in venezuela uninhibited spending has turned the country with the world s largest proven oil reserves into a land where children starve macri sold his administration as an evolved form of governance for these times a crucial dose of market forces tempered by social programs in the most generous reading the medicine has yet to take effect but in the view of beleaguered argentines the country has merely slipped back into the rut that has framed national life for as long as most people can remember we live patching things up said roberto nicoli 62 who runs a silverware company outside the capital buenos aires we never fix things i always say whenever we start doing better i will start getting ready for the next crisis cultivating wealth like many argentine farmers roque tropini is inclined to discuss the present by telling stories about the past a century ago argentina was among the wealthiest nations on earth to tropini that status resulted from the backbreaking labour of pioneers like his grandfather who arrived in the state of entre rios from his native italy and turned the land into prosperity one afternoon tropini 69 drives past the brick flour mill that his grandfather erected in 1920 next to what was then a lonely stop on a new railroad he idled in front of the towering church that his grandfather constructed in the town that grew around the mill viale he named it santa ana after the cathedral in his hometown in northern italy he drove out to his fields where golden sunshine illuminated rows of soybeans stretching to the horizon a combine rolled across the land harvesting a crop mostly destined for china without his family s exertions tropini maintains viale would be a blank spot on the map roque tropini in one of his soybean fields in viale argentina photo sarah pabst the new york times if only the story ended there he says but history delivered the populists who have run argentina for most of his adult life in the beginning there was juan domingo perón the charismatic army general who was president from 1946 to 1955 and then again from 1973 to 1974 he employed an authoritarian hand and muscular state power to champion the poor he and his wife eva duarte widely known by her nickname evita would dominate political life long after they died inspiring politicians across the ideological spectrum to claim their mantle among the most ardent peronists were néstor kirchner the president from 2003 to 2007 and his wife cristina fernández who took office in 2007 remaining until macri was elected in 2015 their version of peronism what became known as kirchnerism was decidedly left wing disdaining global trade as a malevolent force they expanded cash grants to the poor and imposed taxes on farm exports in a bid to keep argentine food prices low as the country s farmers tell it kirchnerism is just a fancy term for the confiscation of their wealth and the scattering of the spoils to the unproductive masses they point to fernández s 35 per cent tax on soybean exports we had a saying tropini says for every three trucks that went to the port one was for christina kirchner given all that tropini cheered the arrival of new president macri s administration promised to modernise government while rebuilding argentina s standing among international investors the cosmopolitan english speaking technocrats who filled his government relished their role as the antidote to the destructive forces sweeping the continent we are a country that is fighting to get away from a legacy of populism that has failed marcos peña macri s chief of cabinet ministers says in a recent interview we embrace that idea of showing the region and the world but especially argentines that with a more open society with a more open political system with a more open economy we can do better than with a closed populist statist culture among the first things the new president announced was a gradual reduction in export taxes you could breathe finally tropini the farmer says he was free of the kirchners yet stuck with nature floods in 2016 wiped out more than half his crops a drought last year wreaked even more havoc this harvest this year he says is a gift from god but if the heavens are now cooperating and if the people running buenos aires represent change tropini is critical of macri s failure to overcome the economic crisis a weaker currency makes argentine soybeans more competitive but it also increases the cost of the diesel fuel tropini needs to run his machinery high interest rates make it impossible for him to buy another combine which would allow him to expand his farm in september faced with a plunge in government revenues macri reinstated some export taxes that money goes to pay for social programs for people who aren t working tropini grouses it goes to support laziness a lot of people got used to not working during peronism there s been so many years of taking away my production don t take all my profit leave some for me what went wrong flybondi is emblematic of what was supposed to happen to the argentine economy as macri unleashed his reforms the upstart airline has its headquarters in a glass fronted skyscraper in the center of buenos aires occupying a shared workspace amid the hiss of espresso machines and the chatter of technology entrepreneurs it owes its existence to one of macri s earliest moves an open skies policy that allowed private air carriers to compete against the state owned giants that dominated aviation the government sought to encourage domestic tourism in place of 24 hour bus rides on narrow curving roads prone to tragic accidents people could fly for an hour or two on a cheap flight in january 2018 flybondi took to the skies using a fleet of five leased boeing 737s much like discount airlines in the united states and europe it drastically undercut the competition by turning its planes around swiftly flying at odd hours and operating out of a fledgling airport an old military base near buenos aires today flybondi operates 17 routes and has grown from 10 employees to 560 still the company would be expanding more quickly growing its fleet and adding routes were it not for the failure of the president s economic policies its chief executive officer sebastián pereira complains fuel constitutes 40 per cent of the airline s costs it is priced in dollars meaning it has gotten more expensive as the peso has lost value flybondi cannot pass on all the extra costs because would be customers are hurting the argentine economy is contracting photo sarah pabst the new york times the situation is not good in argentina pereira says it s not as good as we expected people are not able to pay their bills so how can they think about flying in a plane why the economy remains moribund is the subject of a debate that could determine whether macri gains additional time or whether argentina veers back to populism economists are emphatic that argentina s problems were so enormous that any administration would have faced grave difficulty fernández had bequeathed an unmitigated shambles a budget deficit roughly 8 per cent of the country s annual economic output according to the government data collection had been haphazard and subject to political manipulation making it difficult merely to divine the extent of the crisis the government had long operated like a benefactor to the masses disdaining budget math as a right wing conspiracy macri was the spreadsheet wielding killjoy who was halting the festivities cognizant that more spending courted hyperinflation the president was very conscious from the first day that he had to go as quickly as possible says peña the chief of cabinet ministers when you re a broke and broken country you have to build a shock in terms of credibility in the first years of macri s administration the government lifted controls on the value of the peso while relaxing export taxes the masters of international finance delivered a surge of investment the economy expanded by nearly 3 per cent in 2017 and then accelerated in the first months of last year but as investors grew wary of argentina s deficits they fled sending the peso plunging and inflation soaring as the rout continued last year the central bank mounted a futile effort to support the currency selling its stash of dollars to try to halt the peso s descent as the reserves dwindled investors absorbed the spectacle of a government failing to restore order the exodus of money intensified and another potential default loomed leading a chastened macri to accept a rescue from the dreaded imf administration officials described the unraveling as akin to a natural disaster unforeseeable and unavoidable the drought hurt agriculture money was flowing out of developing countries as the federal reserve continued to lift interest rates in the united states making the us dollar a more attractive investment but the impact of the fed s tightening had been widely anticipated economists fault the government for mishaps and complacency that left the country especially vulnerable some people accuse the macri administration of a cowardly pursuit of gradualism cutting spending too slowly in a fruitless effort to avoid enraging the masses argentina sold us 100b in government bonds during macri s first 2 1 2 years in office exploiting its newfound favour with the international finance set the cash allowed the government to maintain some social programs everybody wants to lend you money so why should you be so cheap says fausto spotorno the chief economist at orlando j ferreres associates a consulting firm in buenos aires they believed they could postpone the crisis and gradually get out of it among the most consequential errors was the government s decision to include argentina s central bank in a december 2017 announcement that it was raising its inflation target the markets took that as a signal that the government was surrendering its war on inflation while opting for a traditional gambit printing money rather than cutting spending it became clearly a symbol of the idea that we had undermined the independence of the central bank peña the chief of cabinet ministers acknowledges other people accuse macri of failing to set realistic expectations he insisted that he could easily conquer inflation while also reducing subsidies which lifted prices for key commodities like electricity

business is anxious people are afraid says nicoli owner of the silverware company prinox llc which was started by his grandfather in 1942 at its peak in the mid 1990s prinox s red brick factory employed 67 people then came a surge of cheap product from china followed by a terrible crisis in 2001 that culminated in the largest default in modern history today 35 people work at the plant amid the thunderous boom of presses pounding loops of stainless steel into silverware four of the seven lines are idle given the weakness of the argentine market the factory buys imported stainless steel the weak peso has lifted the price of the metal but nicoli cannot pass the extra costs to customers mostly restaurants because they are grappling with diminished sales for most of the past year his company has barely broken even the government insists that better days are ahead the spending cuts have dropped the budget deficit to a manageable 3 per cent of annual economic output argentina is again integrated into the global economy we haven t improved but the foundations of the economy and society are much healthier said miguel braun secretary of economic policy at the treasury ministry argentina is in a better place to generate a couple of decades of growth at the silverware factory nicoli scoffs that s only possible through magic and no one believes them he says this is the worst moment and i think it s going to get worse striving to go backward the election has become a cause for alarm especially given the growing likelihood of fernández s candidacy her recently released memoir has been taken as a sign that she will enter the race by late april the price of insurance on government bonds was signaling a better than 50 per cent chance that sometime before 2024 argentina would again default on its debts the world is worried that argentines may want to go backward macri declared in a radio interview i think they are wrong but soon after macri declared that the government was freezing prices on electricity and other crucial commodities borrowing from the kirchnerist tool kit on the litter strewn dirt roads of gregorio de laferrere the notion of going backward holds enormous appeal genovesi 48 and her husband oscar martinez 57 earn some 18 000 pesos a month about us 400 they canceled their gas service after the loss of subsidies lifted their

suzi weissman interviewed robert brenner on february 10 2019 for her beneath the surface broadcast on kpfk in los angeles released on her jacobin radio podcast on february 12 the transcript has been edited for publication here suzi weissman welcome to jacobin radio today we re going to talk about the state of the economy i ve invited robert brenner back for the hour in conversation on politics and the economy matters of great confusion if you read the business pages and hear the politicians all touting record low unemployment rising wages and the recovery of the stock market yet the federal reserve has stopped raising interest rates wages are stagnant precarity and insecurity are the norm â and teachers are striking to force states to stop under investing and save public education so what s the real story let s just start with the stock market to say that there s extreme volatility is a huge understatement and at the same time fed policy on interest rates is itself very volatile so what is going on robert brenner it s not really a very pretty story from the time of the great recession of 2008 9 to today the fed has maintained a policy of super low interest rates â in fact zero or below zero interest rates if you take into account price increases the real interest rate has been zero or below for much of the time low interest rates were the government s main tool to restore order in the markets and to stabilize the economy in the wake of the financial markets crash and the economic slowdown in the past it was common sense to get increased demand directly through deficit spending by way of big masses of government spending but we are in a new era when this is no longer politically in the cards with the same goal of stability the fed carried out so called quantitative easing which called for the fed to buy up huge masses of financial assets with the aim of keeping up their prices and indirectly keeping down the cost of borrowing the result was to create a truly insane asset price bubble â asset price bubbles arose in fact everywhere from artworks to raw materials to houses and above all in the stock market i think everybody knows this because it s been on the front pages for almost a decade now the s p composite index rose from around 1000 in 2009 at its bottom in the wake of the crash to close to 2900 at the peak last december almost tripling in that interval the result was to turn just about anyone who could afford to invest in stocks into a successful investor a financial genius they borrowed at ridiculously low rates guaranteed by the fed and they kept their money in the market as it went up and up people in this audience probably know some people like that too few of them actually are people like that but after almost a decade of this policy which was designed to make the rich richer whatever else it did the excuse of stabilizing the economy was wearing pretty thin â especially because the government and the business press were announcing ever more stridently that the official unemployment rate had fallen to record lows and the economy was experiencing full even over full employment if that were the case it was agreed there would soon be runaway wage growth and in turn uncontrollable price rises up to this point wage stagnation in the face of full employment appeared as a mysterious paradox so the fed felt enormous pressure to return to normal in order to head off wage driven inflation before it got out of control rising and falling so the fed began the slow but steady rise in interest rates at the same time it began to reverse its quantitative easing policy selling off rather than buying fed assets again pushing down the prices of financial assets â which meant pushing down the stock market rather than driving it up in the month of december 2018 after the fed had told everyone it was continuing with this policy stock prices fell the greatest of any month in memory if not in history as the month progressed one day falls became ever huger and it looked like a total collapse was going to happen would the fed keep up its policy of slow but steady monetary tightening this was the question everyone was asking in the end the fed lost its nerve discontinued its policy of slowly raising interest rates and selling off financial assets voila there was another about face and the stock market has already come pretty close to having made up for its recent swoon sw how is it possible everybody who was watching in december was thinking that this was going to be another 2007 8 free fall of the stock market and the economy how could conditions change so much in one month s time to explain first this new bust and what now people are touting as a new boom rb i think there are really two closely related things going on here in the first place the fed and many others have believed that the economy is much stronger than it actually is in particular the fed and others in the government believe that they see in front of them a tight labor market with the official unemployment rate so very low they ve thought that runaway wage growth and runaway inflation are about to break out they conclude that they have to raise interest rates to cut off this development before it starts but in fact the job market is really much weaker than is widely thought as a result when the fed persists in raising interest rates in the face of what is really a weak economy it threatens to cause a crash and a recession that s what we ve seen recently the fed persists in tightening the stock market goes down and the economy is suddenly in deep trouble as you would see if you read the financial times every day in the second place and relatedly the fed and others believe that the record run up of the stock market is ultimately based on a strong real economy but in fact the real economy has been unbelievably feeble across the board â the main trends in the economy have been historically unprecedentedly bad the stock market rise is not based on strong fundamentals its foundation is instead just the fed s ultra low interest rates so when the fed raises interest rates as it just did it tanks the stock market and in turn destroys what little growth the real economy has been capable of providing in short the stock market needs the same artificial policy of bubblenomics that was introduced by alan greenspan in the 1980s continued by his successor ben bernanke and continues today under jerome powell a closer look at employment what about the labor market no one can deny the fact that we ve seen job creation month after month this has brought us to full employment at least according to the figures of the government and supposedly a great economy but what is the actual evidence the actual state of jobs and the labor market the unemployment rate according to the labor department and the fed is now under four percent which truly would be super low â if the unemployment rate measured by the government today meant the same thing as that rate did in the past a below four percent rate would have indicated a super strong economy a super tight labor market and we would indeed have expected very fast rising wages and accelerating inflation but what s the reality the official unemployment rate as people might know measures the percentage of the labor force who are unemployed â but as measured by the government the labor force itself only includes people who either have jobs or are looking for work the key point is that it does not include people who have stopped looking for work because they have become discouraged and thus dropped out of the labor force in dropping out of the labor force they cease to be counted as unemployed the labor force participation rate â the proportion of the total population ages 18 to 64 who are employed or looking for work â fell sharply at the time when the crisis hit and is still far from returning to its level then of 2007 put another way the employed proportion of the actual population capable of working is still a long way from reaching its level before the crash that percentage was about 63 in 2007 but even now after so many months of adding labor it is still between 2 3 below that level so this is hardly full employment even if it looks like it the bottom line is that there s nothing paradoxical about stagnant wages the demand for jobs has still to come back to what it was in relation to supply of jobs the labor market is still not all that tight so wage pressure is not all that high in addition equally important â and this is a very big deal â you can t just look at the numbers hired the numbers who have been employed but what sort of jobs they are getting and if you have an audience as we probably do which has been going through this labor market over the last decade they re having to take much worse jobs than they had before the crisis hit that each worker s job pays less than their previous one makes it even more understandable that there s no reason to expect runaway wage gains and runaway inflation in following a traditional policy of raising rates to respond to what it believes to be strong labor market the fed has been operating under quite a false assumption it should be no surprise that it eventually disrupts both the financial markets and underlying economy economy and the 2016 election sw trump is claiming of course that the state of the economy is strong but the democrats don t disagree they simply deny that trump is responsible for it democrats and republicans are both trying to take credit are they both wrong rb this is really a crucial point not just economically but politically these claims of a strong economy are and should be wearing quite thin after all what happened in 2016 trump s rightwing advisors bannon and mercer understood that the economy was weak that people were not finding work or were landing crappy jobs this provided the starting point in fact the ultimate basis for trump s so called populist presidential campaign and for his victory i won t belabor this â i ve talked about it on your show â still i can t resist shouting out the fact that the economy has been getting weaker for close to a half a century outside of the bubbles when it was driven artificially by the great stock market run up of the 1990s and the equally ill fated housing price run up between 2002 and 2007 first wages as most of us know by now aren t a lot higher than they were at the end of the 1970s we ve had a whole generation experiencing wage stagnation â and since the great recession it s been even worse second what about capital accumulation meaning investment the driving force of the capitalist economy the period roughly between the end of world war ii to about 1973 is known as the postwar boom and was indeed a highly expansionary period across the board but that expansion ended in the 1970s since the 70s the growth of plant and equipment in the private sector has fallen steadily decade by decade business cycle by business cycle and hit rock bottom in the period since the great recession by the 1990s the growth of plant and equipment had already dropped to half of what it was during the postwar boom third most telling of all is labor productivity which economists focus on for good reason â because it gives us the best measure of how much people can afford given what their costs of production are high labor productivity allows for a correspondingly higher surplus available to invest amazingly since the 1970s growth in labor productivity has been the lowest it s been in a century comparing labor productivity growth from the 1970s until today we find it is significantly lower than the 1920 1948 period which included the great depression another way to look at this is that in the period between 1973 and the present the growth of labor productivity has stagnated at about 1 5 per year leaving out the bubble years of 1995 2007 stock prices and stagnant profits sw how do we account for a runaway stock market if the labor market is not tight and the real economy has been weak rb it s completely in keeping with all the other things we ve seen about the economy looking at the non financial sector â because the financial sector is not a very good sector to understand profit making directly â in the private sector minus finance profits have been pretty much flat over the last 4 5 years and in fact going all the way back to 2012 in 2012 profits outside the financial sector hit 1 5 trillion and by 2017 were only around 1 6 trillion they ve been fluctuating in that range throughout the intervening period so there has been barely any increase profits have stagnated while stock prices have skyrocketed with the consequence that stock prices have completely lost touch with the underlying values of the corporations they represent robert schiller the famous economist has shown in his calculations that the ratio between prices and profits is higher today than it has been at any other point in recorded history except for two interesting years â 1929 the year of the great stock market crash that led into the great depression and 1999 2000 which led immediately in to the famous high tech crash of 2000 2001 what is making the stock market soar and the rich super rich is the fed s stimulative policy of bubblenomics low interest rate and buying up financial assets which we call quantitative easing but it hasn t succeeded in driving up anything else especially the productive economy no wonder that the stock market went into that swoon as soon as the fed made clear it was serious about tightening monetary policy then made a recovery when it changed its mind sw how do we account for this bizarrely weak economy one in which the rich have been making off like bandits you ve often said it s because of insufficient demand and that insufficient demand is why capitalists aren t investing and hiring more why they aren t spending more money why in fact they are still hoarding money to speak to this question of insufficient demand you ve argued that the answer is the problem of overcapacity on a world scale rb i ll start with the weakness and try to move to this pretty weird economy that has now emerged there s been ever intensifying competition on a world scale going from germany japan and the east asian newly industrializing countries nics the east asian tigers and above all this giant of china each new wave of manufacturers is producing ever more cheaply than those that came before because each in turn has an ever lower priced labor force but also can imitate the technology of its predecessors so what s overtaken not just the u s economy but the world economy is that manufacturing output is growing everywhere but without reference to the market this has meant that everywhere it has become ever more difficult to invest in new plant and equipment hire labor and sell on the world market and actually make a profit in so doing that is not a development that was just confined to the united states and to europe and japan but has overtaken china itself which is suffering from the same difficulty of overinvestment leading to over capacity the fall in the rate of profit is the link between over capacity and falling or insufficient demand with low profitability companies have smaller surpluses to invest and less motivation to do so they have to get their costs down in order to remain competitive so they put downward pressure on wages the government helps by reducing government serv ices so that corporate taxes can be reduced so you have a combination of lower demand for investment goods plant and equipment for consumer goods and for government services â a problem of falling demand in the aggregate the immediate cause of the economic slowdown equally to the point companies come to see over time that even if it looks like they can make a profit in the short run taking account of how things have evolved in the world economy during recent decades they are likely to come up short in the longer run because a new set of lower cost producers will come on line and prevent them from realizing their investments american policymakers first came up against this problem in the 1970s and it hit them in the gut in a way they had never thought could happen after all american manufacturing had been the world leader and the world model since the civil war and especially since the turn of the 20th century dominating its competitors right into the middle 1960s but then quite suddenly you have this process of intensified competition leading to a fall in the rate of profit and government authorities have no answer they try on the one hand to help the capitalist producers by reducing the exchange rate of the dollar by reducing the cost of borrowing and introducing measures of trade protection at the same time they make the standard turn to keynesian deficit spending but despite their help both on the so called supply side to lower the cost of production in america and on the demand side â by the end of the 1970s profit rates had fallen significantly further by a total of 50 in manufacturing so by the time we hit 1980 there is demoralization throughout the entire postwar liberal establishment comprised of both republicans and democrats the so called neoclassical keynesian synthesis had totally failed and they didn t really know what to do what s new about neoliberalism sw you re describing an economy that seems to be at an unprecedented impasse how does the capitalist class get out of it rb in this unprecedented predicament â what you quite properly term an unprecedented impasse â government policymakers politicians capitalists and the rich fumbled around for something new they did in the end come up with something new that did allow them to transcend the underlying impasse â although exactly how this happened is still not entirely clear over the course of the 1980s a completely new framework of political economy emerged almost everyone has noticed this and they ve called this new framework neoliberalism and i think that s okay but it is misleading in some fundamental respects in the first place most people talk about austerity a relentless attack on workers as central to neoliberalism that s understandable but there s nothing particularly new or special about austerity and an attack on workers wages and conditions as a response to falling profitability you don t need a new system neoliberalism to have that every capitalist generation has done that when faced with falling profits so austerity has been a central fact of our world our economy all through this period but it doesn t define a new period secondly much more to the point i think in talking about neoliberalism people have talked about the freeing up of the economy from any sort of essential regulation or government control â in effect opening up every possible arena to the intensification of competition this is particularly evident when we look at the freeing up of world trade and world investment to international competition we call it globalization and this i think is very much worth noting as a new or relatively new feature of the period from the late 1970s and early 1980s however there s a real problem with focusing simply on freer markets and increased competition as at the core of neoliberalism in my opinion a development even more at the heart of the new framework of political economy goes in a sense in the opposite direction of freer markets and more intense competition this is the new tendency of the most elite layers of finance of managers of nonfinancial corporations and top leadership of the political parties to see to the upward redistribution of wealth to themselves by political means what s essential here is the opposite of competitiveness it is access to special privileges that directly yield wealth thanks to political position or connection so we have the forging of an alliance among leading capitalists running corporations the very rich and political parties controlling governments which began with marriages of convenience but soon became an unbreakable chain it is about dealing with this problem of low returns on investment â the difficulty of making profits by putting new plant and equipment together with new workers and selling the product on the market and making a lot of money that difficulty has led to skipping if you will that process of earning money as the grandparents of today s capitalists did by way of productive investment in farms factories offices instead what we have is a whole series of new institutions and new policies which make possible the upward redistribution of wealth to the top the absolute top layer of the economy so these people don t have to go through the complex and risky processes needed to increase the size of the pie and getting a share of that â making profits while paying wages they can cut to the chase and simply force wealth upward to themselves the key here is politics which allows for upward redistribution of wealth through various political means what are the ways we don t have the time here to list them all but the main channels are very familiar first tax cuts every administration republican or democrat from carter on has implemented huge cuts in taxation the politics of financialization secondly as governments have financed themselves increasingly by way of borrowing we ve seen that rich people are making huge fortunes simply by buying government debt and collecting the interest on it â almost a foolproof way of making money they buy government debt and their returns are pretty much certain thirdly governments have stopped enforcing anti monopoly legislation and this has had a particularly positive effect in the central segments of today s economy namely the high tech producers what you essentially have is a new form of protectionism â the enforcement of so called intellectual property rights thanks to stronger intellectual property rights firms are able for example to have their innovations protected from competition for much longer than in the past because patents last much longer than used to be the case it s good to be apple fourthly there s privatization just taking activities that had been carried out by governments â health education pension and so forth â and just handing them over to the capitalists and the rich to make a private profit on them finally â here i m going to have to foreshorten a long discussion â we have the rise of the financial sector which is no doubt the main base of the new political economy of upwardly distributing wealth through political means here we have the classic political alliance between political parties and financial firms of all sorts where the financial firms get privileges from the politicians and parties in government and the financial firms hand over money to the politicians and parties to pay for their political campaigns and make the very top political leaders extremely rich so to put it very schematically governments deregulate certain financial activities to allow those who first enter to make super profits do their best to protect those activities so as to limit competition and then when the losses inevitably begin to mount organize the expected bailouts i have to cut very short this story of financialization but i do want to get to one key aspect of this rise of finance that perfectly exemplifies the new political economy of making money through the politically driven upward redistribution of wealth and this allows me to connect with a big theme of the first part of our discussion this is what we would call bubblenomics the turn of the federal reserve to driving up the stock market through keeping interest rates artificially low bubblenomics makes for the most rapid creation of wealth â of course it s not really wealth it s paper â but owners of stock invest in them and ultimately cash them in and make a fortune so much more rapidly and cleanly than they ever could if they had to go through the whole process of investment in production this bubblenomics is at the center of this new upward redistribution of wealth and helps us understand more clearly the fed s easy money policy that i was discussing earlier so how do we assess the payoffs provided by this new economy of politically driven upward redistribution of wealth we now have the epochal research by piketty and saez who enabled us to get to the heart of the process by researching what they call top income earners their results are now pretty well known and extraordinarily revealing during the postwar boom we actually had decreasing inequality and very limited income going to the top income brackets for the whole period from the 1940s to the end of the 1970s the top 1 of earners received 9 10 of total income no more but in the short period since 1980 their share that is the share of the top 1 has gone up to 25 while the bottom 80 have made virtually no gains now hopefully we can see the big picture on the one hand capitalists and the very rich are not investing much or employing many workers this is not because they wouldn t like to but unlike the period of the great postwar boom they can t do so profitably there s limited opportunity to actually get rich by investing in plant and equipment and software and hiring new people the way their grandfathers did so it is understandable that we have the lowest levels of investment the worst productivity performance and the lowest wage growth on the one hand and the stock market run up on the other it could not be clearer in my opinion that what s making rich people ever richer â and this is the sum of politically sponsored favors secured from the political parties in control of government and financialization of politics sw so this new economy that we ve been living in for decades as you ve just stated is literally political to its core the question then is what this means for society as a whole and not just for the 1 rb i think we can clearly see the payoff today of this way of looking at things and i mean at this very moment most strikingly there has been â and quite understandably â a loss of interest on the part of the ruling class the rich the elites in any longer securing from governments the things that the state has classically provided for capitalism the capitalists classically wanted and the state has provided a whole series of services that the capitalists cannot easily provide and the whole of society above all the working class has made sure the capitalists get these state provision of infrastructure state support for education state support for health and welfare the capitalist class is not very nice nor particularly generous but they need these things if they re going to have a productive economy and not only the capitalists but also the population benefits from them the case of korea where these things get provided as a matter of course is no accident korea is one of the few countries that still maintains and depends on a productive economy featuring manufacturing but if the capitalists the rich the elites don t depend any longer on a productive economy â if they are not making money to anything like the extent they once did on profitable investment in capital and labor â then they don t depend on the state to carry out its traditional implementation of these functions so what we ve seen is that the capitalists the rich and the leading politicians have been not just neutral but pushing actively against the state carrying out these functions this is because they don t want the state to waste its money on these functions for the simple reason that they don t want to pay taxes to finance them throughout the postwar boom we had quite decent levels of government investment in plant and equipment fixed assets of all kinds the construction of the interstate highway system comes immediately to mind but you also had the impressive growth of public education including universities you even had a massive if strictly limited increase in state financed health care for example through medicare growing government investment made all these things possible but starting around 1970 when the international crisis of overinvestment leading to over capacity began to bring down the rate of profit in a big way that investment by the state began a long process of deceleration the amount of new investment ceased to keep up with this using up and wearing out of government owned fixed assets the age of government plant and equipment remained on average at around 14 years through the postwar boom â which meant that the state was keeping up new investment fast enough make up for depreciation but from then on the age of government capital increased steadily and without cease and is now on average 27 years collapse and fightback the collapse of state investment is crumpling before us in every way it has meant as people are aware a deepening crisis in infrastructure if you go over a bridge you re likely to fall into a river trains are not just regularly late but going off the track infrastructure in high tech telecommunications in particular is far behind that in asia where the speed of the internet and quality of mobile phones easily exceed our own then there s basic healthcare which we hardly need to discuss with this audience here where what s pretty much a right throughout the rest of the capitalist countries is still quite controversial for the american elite including among declared democratic party candidates in the coming election perhaps most prominently there s been the reactionary bipartisan consensus on public education thanks to the clintons bush and obama â long before trump â we ve seen a systematically implemented bipartisan disinvestment in public education the proliferation of charter schools privatization and teaching to the test in los angeles where we live it s been hitting us in the face for years until â it makes me cry it s so wonderful â the recent victorious la teachers strike which is of course part of a spectacular upsurge of teachers struggles across the country from chicago to the red states and now throughout california sw what you re saying has really sobering if not depressing implications but the top 1 or maybe 0 1 have been able to get away with this for so long because there s been no fightback the latest bureau of labor statistics shows that we ve just been through the period with the least amount of strikes in recorded history but spectacularly that has changed in the last year with teachers and public sector revolts which are continuing apace and show no sign of slowing down so what has all that meant for us and especially in this period of the beginning of a fightback rb the message could not be clearer and is really very sobering if people are going to get these services that they need for a decent life â if they re going to get the education or health or infrastructure or new skills training or money for a decent retirement â they are going to have to fight for it to impose it on a ruling class that emphatically does not want it the la teachers showed the way in their recent strike when they proclaimed that they are fighting for the common good and that they can get this only by fighting for it against the powers that be for most of the people who listen to this show it means that we re going to have to do it against the wishes of this country s political leadership not just of the republican party but the democratic party as well the democrats have pursued all these policies designed to speed the upward distribution of wealth by political means in the same way if not so fast as the republicans have â and they are not even yet agreed on nationally supported healthcare sw so how does this relate to the green new deal that s been advanced by alexandria ocasio cortez bernie sanders and so many others rb in the past the government has supported the economy in the most conservative possible way basically through subsidizing and assuring the profits of private corporations the limit to this can be found in the dependence on what its supporters call keynesian policy or the so called neoclassical keynesian synthesis this is also called demand management or deficit spending what this means is that they have the most conservative most market based possible means for supporting demand they reduce taxes which means that government deficits rise and government deficits press indifferently on the economy supposedly to stimulate it in a neutral manner allowing the most promising industry to thrive but what we know is that this will not work today stimulating demand in general does not get us investment let alone investment that stimulates other investment as we have seen it is very difficult to invest profitably in this country or anywhere else in this period to get some indication of this just look at the historic trump tax breaks which are creating ever greater deficits and putting money for free in the hands of capitalist and the rich but eliciting little or no investment or growth what is meant by keynesianism today has no chance to bring about a transformation of the economy that depends on the creation of new industries and imposing the regulations necessary to make it a green new deal so what we need is â i think we have to pay attention to the rhetoric here â is not really a keynesian policy as it is commonly understood it is direct state intervention think of the new deal which we now understand had much more government investment than we thought and think about â sadly but a good example â what happens during wartime â focused state support and supervision of investment immediately designed to bring a specific outcome we need to move in other words against the natural tendency of the private capitalist economy today â and that means we need to force a state policy of investment that would never be supported in any other way against the current

in a last minute hitch talks between pakistan and the international monetary fund imf have reached a deadlock due to change in goalpost by the fund and the prime minister s reservations over heavy taxation resulting into extension in parleys there were at least three main sticking points that led to inconclusive talks till the last day of the imf visit said sources in the ministry of finance as of thursday the top management of the ministry of finance was hopeful to conclude the deal and the imf team had planned to return on may 11 but the sources said things went off the track after the imf insisted on inclusion of some new conditions in the programme which appeared unreasonable prime minister imran khan also expressed reservations over massive additional taxes burden that the nation will bear from july this year provided both sides reach an agreement we have made good progress in our discussions with the visiting imf mission consultations will continue over the weekend said dr khaqan hasan najeeb the spokesman of the finance ministry pakistan has accepted the imf s demands of flexible exchange rate regime withdrawal of subsidies containing borrowings from the central bank and reinitiating the privatisation programme led by its washington based mission chief ernesto rigo the imf team was originally supposed to stay in pakistan from april 28 to may 10 rigo will stay in pakistan for at least one more day in hope to conclude the deal the sources said the imf has sent a draft of the proposed agreement to washington for vetting that includes some new conditions these conditions were no part of negotiations in the first round of talks when the state bank of pakistan former governor tariq bajwa was part of pakistani team the sources said the imf reopened the issue of upfront increase in discount rate by at least 2 despite the real interest rates were already positive by 3 75 the other key area was the exchange rate as the imf model showed at least 20 further devaluation of rupee against the us dollar the rupee dollar parity will undergo further change if pakistan and the imf reach a staff level agreement on saturday today the sources said adding that initially pm imran had certain reservations but he softened his position after at least two rounds of discussions with his adviser dr hafeez shaikh there is inflation in the country and prices of gas and electricity are going up to retire debt of energy sector said imran khan while addressing a public gathering on friday it appeared the premier was preparing the nation for difficult times ahead the talks remained inconclusive despite pakistan conceded to almost everything that the imf asked for the sources added pakistan and the imf are engaged to finalise the bailout package for the past eight months it was the second visit by the imf staff level team during the past five months that again could not conclude the deal within the due time pakistan s new programme will be of egyptian model because the new sbp chief dr reza baqir a former imf official is implementing that programme said dr ashfaque hasan khan a member of government s economic advisory council he said this will also be painful for pakistanis the way it was painful to egypt dr khan said there should be no more devaluation and no more hike in interest rates otherwise economy will be totally choked there is an apprehension that the imf is also working under the influence of the us government that is creating more problems for pakistan the sources said after the induction of new sbp governor into pakistan s economic team the focus of the talks largely shifted from fiscal to monetary issues the imf wanted that the interest rate should be around 13 to contain the inflationary pressures that are expected to build up due to withdrawal of electricity subsidies and further currency devaluation on the fiscal front the imf s main concern was the primary balance instead of the overall budget deficit this would require massive increase in next year s tax collection target which was also the matter of concern for prime minister imran khan but the senior officials of the finance ministry are hopeful that the staff level agreement could be reached today saturday once the proposed draft is vetted by the imf senior management

inflation data suggested that wholesale pipeline inflation is moderating so there s less pressure on the federal reserve america s central bank to raise interest rates while revived tension between china and the us helped to drive demand for safe assets the chart below shows the difference the spread between what it costs the us government to borrow money over ten years and what it costs over two once this number turns negative the yield curve has inverted which almost always signals a recession although perhaps not for up to two years the gap between the yield on the ten year us treasury and that on the two year going back three months gold measured in dollar terms rebounded somewhat as geopolitical tension grew what with rising trade tension and north korea deciding to test some more missiles gold three months the us dollar index a measure of the strength of the dollar against a basket of the currencies of its major trading partners fell back this week despite all of these reasons for investors to be seeking safe havens which is interesting dxy three months ten year yields on the world s major developed market bonds were lower as inflation came in lower than expected and fears

again this week as hopes of an imminent deal between the us and china were dashed copper three months the aussie dollar our favourite indicator of the state of the chinese economy slid hard this week too partly because of the ailing chinese deal partly because the aussie economy isn t in great nick either and finally because it has breached a previous floor at the us 0 70 level that was a key

until after this four week moving average has hit a low for the cycle a recession tends to follow about a year later bear in mind judged on a tiny sample size what s interesting is that we made a new

u s review all trade all the time prior to the recent escalation there had actually been something of a détente in the trade war china s informal agreement to buy more u s soybeans helped shrink the trade deficit with china to its smallest since 2016 this could reverse if a deal is not reached soon the consumer price index this week indicated that inflation continues to run close to the fomc s target this week s substantial rise in tariffs however is set to put upward pressure on inflation all trade all the time tariff concerns dominated the headlines this week following president trump s threat on sunday to raise tariffs on 200 billion worth of chinese imports to 25 from 10 at present we discuss the potential fallout from the tariff hike and renewed bout of uncertainty stemming from trade policy in our topic of the week on page 7 data this week however provided a fresh look at where the trade deficit and inflation are heading into what could be a tumultuous period for imports exports and pricing the trade deficit widened slightly in march to 50 0 billion exports posted an increase for the third consecutive month but imports jumped 1 1 after a measly gain in february and a drop in january the widening does not look to be quite as large as the bea estimated heading into the initial release of q1 gdp suggesting the boost from trade may get revised lower amid a quasi pause in the trade war with china as negotiations were progressing the bilateral deficit with china narrowed in march to the smallest gap in about three years soybean exports which had been caught in the crosshairs of the trade battle jumped more than half a billion dollars presumably contributing to the narrower deficit with china with trade tensions flaring again and the possibility of retaliatory tariffs exports to china may come under renewed pressure at least inflation is low for now with tariffs back in the spotlight the upside risks to inflation are back as well we estimate that this week s tariff hike could raise consumer price inflation up to 0 15 bps when measured on a year ago basis that is likely to be an upper bound however as reduced demand a stronger dollar existing contracts and some absorption by businesses limit the blow if tariffs of 25 are extended to all imports from china including many finished consumer goods the impact to inflation would be more noticeable for now inflation remains relatively quiescent consumer prices rose 0 3 during april and 2 0 over the year a somewhat softer increase than expected the topline measure was boosted by higher energy prices which saw a monthly increase of 2 9 alongside rising oil prices shelter prices gained 0 4 in april stemming from higher rents of primary residences however food apparel and used vehicle prices each registered a monthly decline excluding volatile food and energy prices prices rose 0 1 during the month but ticked up to a 2 1 gain over the past year producer prices were also fairly tame in april but suggest inflation is edging up again prices for goods and services made by domestic producers increased more slowly than expected in march but that was largely due to the volatile trade services component which measures retail and wholesale margins our preferred measure of core ppi which strips out food energy and trades services rose 0 4 and has turned up again on a year over year basis at 2 2 however and with only moderate growth in input costs the upturn does not suggest inflation is about to become unhinged and while the labor market remains solid it is not tightening without abandon job openings rebounded in march but remain off the highs reached last year initial jobless claims were also little changed from last week pushing the four week average back above 2018 s lows u s outlook retail sales wednesday march retail sales rose 1 6 over the month with gains in every category except sporting goods headline sales were boosted by a 3 1 increase in motor vehicle sales and a gain at gas stations largely due to higher prices at the pump in march excluding volatile components the control group unexpectedly rose 1 0 suggesting that the u s consumer has not gone into hiding online retailers saw monthly gains for the third straight month after a soft patch in q4 2018 consumer confidence also rose more than expected in april providing some momentum for the consumer going into the second quarter consumers were able to regain some lost confidence after some positive developments in equity markets despite the strong data in march it was not enough to prevent real consumption growth from slowing in the first quarter pce grew at an annualized pace of 1 2 we look for a 0 2 increase in april retail sales previous 1 6 wells fargo 0 2 consensus 0 2 month over month industrial production wednesday the industrial sector continues to lose momentum as total production edged down 0 1 month over month in march the weakness was more pronounced in motor vehicle parts which fell 2 5 and is down 4 5 over the past year mining output also softened 0 8 due to the drop in oil prices in late 2018 and reduced extraction of coal we expect mining output to make modest positive contributions to growth however in the coming months the slowdown in production has raised concern about the outlook for manufacturing as continued trade uncertainty and slower global growth have caused the sector to struggle we may see a flat number here in april and any gains are likely to remain modest we continue to monitor the ism manufacturing index which is lower on trend in recent months despite not reaching recessionary territory previous 0 1 wells fargo 0 0 consensus 0 0 month over month housing starts thursday housing starts continued to struggle in march dropping 0 3 after declining 12 the prior month starts have fallen six out of the past seven months with permits showing a similar trend falling for the past three months single family permits fell 1 1 while multifamily permits fell an even larger 2 7 despite the decline permits for both single family and multifamily homes remain well above starts suggesting we should see an improvement in building activity later this year homebuilding confidence has risen as expectations for single family home sales over the next six months have improved slightly despite a sluggish first quarter we do not think homebuilding is as slow as the data suggest the weakened housing market has already slowed price appreciation and encouraged builders to undertake value engineering the housing market will be watched closely as the spring selling season is upon us previous 1 139k wells fargo 1 190k consensus 1 218k global review global trade risks reemerge the decision from u s president trump to raise tariffs on chinese goods this week increases the downside risks to global growth and the pressure is now even higher on china and the united states to reach a trade deal the latest tariff increase could shave about 0 2 percentage points off chinese gdp growth in 2019 depending how chinese policymakers respond u k gdp growth was strong in q1 and while some of that strength reflected inventory building underlying domestic demand was more robust than expected canada s employment data printed a bit soft but the labor market is still generally holding up well despite weakening economic growth not this again global trade risk is back in focus after u s president trump raised the 10 tariff on us 200 billion worth of chinese goods to 25 the reemergence and escalation in the u s china trade tensions pose downside risk to our chinese gdp growth forecast currently 6 2 for 2019 as we think it could shave off around 0 2 percentage points off gdp growth this year depending on the policy response from chinese authorities china has previously hinted that it could dial back the degree of policy support it has been providing likely a response to easing tariff risks and leverage concerns however now that trade risks have escalated we would expect a commensurate response from chinese authorities to contain the economic risks already this week chinese policymakers announced lower reserve requirement ratios rrr for small and mid sized banks and we would expect more measures to be forthcoming in the days and weeks ahead chinese trade data for april released this week showed the previously implemented tariffs may have already had a notable impact the trade surplus narrowed to us 13 8 billion driven by a sharp slowdown in exports and a jump in imports digging into the details chinese exports to the united states have shown considerably more weakness than exports to the rest of the world now that the tariffs have been raised chinese exports to the united states could come under even more pressure the next steps are unclear china threatened to retaliate earlier this week but since then has not announced any specific countermeasures shifting gears to europe data from the united kingdom released this week showed strong growth for q1 gdp rose 0 5 not annualized on a sequential basis during the quarter matching expectations a closer look at the data shows growth was partly driven by temporary inventory building ahead of brexit but underlying domestic demand was also stronger than expected private consumption rose 0 7 during the quarter while business investment unexpectedly rose 0 5 the first increase in more than a year the data bode well for the u k economy and run counter to the narrative that activity in q1 was driven mainly by pre brexit stockpiling we now see greater upside risks to our 2019 u k gdp forecast of 1 3 on the political front talks to resolve brexit between the u k conservative and labour parties have thus far yielded nothing in the way of tangible results and it seems the brexit stalemate is poised to linger for the foreseeable future the contrast between brexit uncertainty and strong domestic growth is a bit difficult to square but for now it seems the economy is determined to shrug off any concerns making our way back around to north america canada s jobs numbers for april came in well above expectations as the monthly job gain of 106 500 was the largest on record full time jobs accounted for the bulk of the gain while the jobless rate edged lower to 5 7 even as labor force participation ticked higher canada s labor market has been remarkably resilient despite weakness in economic growth and we think labor market developments will be key to watch if growth continues to falter global outlook eurozone industrial output tuesday the eurozone economy is starting to show tentative signs of stabilization as q1 gdp rose a more solid 0 4 not annualized on a sequential basis a nearly 2 month over month jump in industrial output in january may have helped the overall growth print but output fell modestly in february and the consensus expectation is for a 0 3 drop in march these figures suggest the economy lost some momentum by the end of the quarter to be sure retail sales were also strong in q1 a positive sign for consumer spending activity we will not get a full breakdown of gdp into its demand side components for another month so these monthly activity figures are one of the few ways to ascertain the drivers of demand growth for now business fixed investment and consumer spending were underwhelming in the second half of 2018 and it will be important to gauge the performance of these two components of domestic demand in q1 previous 0 2 consensus 0 3 month over month china economic activity tuesday china is another economy that has shown some signs of more stable growth recently as q1 gdp growth beat expectations with a 6 4 year over year gain monthly activity figures including industrial output and retail sales were solid for march suggesting the economy carried some momentum into q2 in that sense next week s release of key activity figures for april including industrial output and retail sales will be important in gauging whether the chinese economy kept that solid momentum going at the start of q2 these figures will not however capture any of the possible disruptions that could come from president trump s latest decision to raise tariffs on chinese goods we will have to wait until the release of the may pmis at the end of the month before we can get a sense for how these actions affected sentiment until then the financial market response will be more instructive previous industrial output 6 4 retail sales 8 4 consensus industrial output 6 5 retail sales 8 4 banxico policy announcement thursday at a time when most central banks around the globe have turned more dovish mexico s central bank has been hesitant to change its hawkish tune that is particularly interesting given just how tight monetary policy is in mexico right now the policy rate currently stands at 8 25 while core inflation is running at just 3 5 implying a real policy rate of nearly 5 the tightness of mexican monetary policy highlights the concern among policymakers over upside inflation risks but high real interest rates are increasingly showing signs of weighing on interest rate sensitive sectors of the mexican economy such as investment spending eventually we expect the central bank to capitulate and start to signal rate cuts the currency has been reasonably stable and concerns about mexico s political situation have lessened for now and the central bank may take advantage of this relative stability in the domestic situation to ease policy previous 8 25 consensus 8 25 point of view interest rate watch higher tariffs lower rates president trump s tweet last week announcing his intention to boost tariffs on chinese goods to 25 from 10 and possibly extend tariffs to virtually all chinese imports rattled the financial markets this week the prior thinking was that the trade negotiations were making progress and that a formal agreement would be signed in mid june that still may happen but the latest rift which appears to have been brought on by the inability to agree on an enforcement mechanism has reintroduced considerable uncertainty as to when and if an agreement will be reached the lack of a trade deal and rise in tariffs will slow global economic growth even further which means u s manufacturing activity and inflation are both likely to decelerate further as well long term yields fell slightly over the week but the treasury auctions went poorly which has kept the slope of the yield curve solidly positive with tariffs and the expanded trade war apparently worsening the odds of a cut in the federal funds rate have increased federal funds futures currently imply two quarter point rate cuts by the end of 2020 we currently have one rate cut at the end of 2020 which might need to be pulled forward if the increased uncertainty causes real economic growth to slow which seems likely the remarkably tame inflation data give the federal reserve plenty of room to maneuver both the ppi and cpi data came in slightly below expectations during april the headline cpi rose 0 3 largely behind a big increase in gasoline prices prices excluding food and energy rose just 0 1 however which was below expectations the core cpi has risen 2 1 over the past year but the core pce deflator which is the fed s preferred price gauge is up just 1 6 while some fed participants have raised concerns about lower inflation the economy continues to show a great deal of resilience solid job growth and an unemployment rate of just 3 6 likely create a fairly high bar for the federal reserve to cut rates that said growing concerns about trade likely raise the bar even further on any potential rate hikes credit market insights c i credit crunch u s bank respondents reported to the federal reserve that demand decreased among all major loan categories in the first quarter banks were more willing to extend credit however likely reflecting the notably more dovish stance among global central banks credit standards are reported in the senior loan officer opinion survey sloos which is released by the federal reserve and asks participating banks to gauge lending practices and behaviors demand for commercial industrial c i loans was reported to be notably weaker in the first quarter the net percentage of firms reporting strong demand for c i loans from large medium firms was 16 9 the weakest since the great recession actual records of banks balance sheets tracked by the fed s h 8 report however show credit is being extended indeed c i loans grew an annualized pace of 9 8 in q1 2019 the decreased demand hasn t yet translated into lower lending volumes but could this be the start of a c i credit crunch with demand for c i loans steadily declining since 2014 we do not expect a renewed pick up in demand but banks eased standards for such loans in the first quarter likely providing some incentive to firms for impending investment we would need to see a large retrenchment in banks willingness to extend credit coupled with tightening of standards before we became truly worried of a forthcoming suppression in c i lending topic of the week doubling down on tariffs the increase to 25 from 10 previously on 200 billion of various chinese goods imports went into effect earlier today and while some products in transit may be allowed in on a temporary basis the hope that cooler heads will prevail was dashed once again still a new deal with china could emerge soon and the administration had positive remarks about a letter received from chinese president xi jinping for now however the chinese trade delegation leaves washington without a deal in hand and amid heightened financial market anxiety the vix index a measure of volatility is nearing levels last seen in december s market swoon for now the 325 billion in new tariffs on other chinese imported goods has not yet gone into effect though the president said those tariffs would go into effect shortly and would also be at the higher 25 rate u s law requires public hearings and a comment period prior to the recent escalation from the president s tweets over the weekend there had actually been something of a détente in the trade war with china agreeing to buy more u s soybeans for example soybean exports jumped by more than half a billion dollars in march meaning exports of that crop alone accounted for about a quarter of the 2 1 billion increase in overall goods exports this has occurred alongside a rebound in u s exports to china top chart this could reverse if a deal is not reached soon beyond just buying fewer u s soybeans the chinese government could increase the existing tariff rate on a variety of u s imported goods already subject to chinese tariffs which would likely put renewed pressure on u s exports the increased trade tension with china could lead some businesses to infer that the administration is potentially embarking on a more aggressive trade policy stance the deceleration in business investment in equipment in recent quarters could reflect at least in part uncertainty related to trade policy bottom chart
donald trump is making a high stakes bet on his 2020 re election with his decision to impose new tariffs on china that the us economy is strong enough to absorb an all out trade war and might even benefit trump set out his rationale in a series of tweets friday morning after raising tariffs to 25 percent on 200 billion in goods from china and threatening more chinese and us officials held brief talks in washington that were unproductive according to people unfamiliar with the matter tariffs will make our country much stronger not weaker the president predicted in a tweet

commentary from both official and nongovernment figures it s clear the chinese economy is in dire straits in the second half of 2018 estimates of china s gdp growth ranged from around 6 percent to negative 1 6 percent indicating a sustained downturn the rapid development of china s economy over the past two decades has basically depended on the interplay of three factors first china enjoyed long term low interest rates currency easing high interest margins and rapid investment growth with the financial sector s monopoly banks turned huge profits stimulating business creation the government tended to take advantage of these low financing costs by increasing support for large scale public investments the second factor was east asia s export oriented model an industrial policy that attracted foreign investment and spurred low level export oriented manufacturing both these factors have long been the subject of expert discussion but there is a third factor that has passed almost unnoticed the series of chinese policy reforms that brought nonmonetary economic activities into the monetary economy an essential feature of a modern economy is monetization that is the use of currency to quantify and account for all economic activity in a pre modern society economic activities are less likely to be measured by currency for example people surviving on subsistence farming and thus foregoing trade and currency on several occasions prior to the 1980s the international monetary fund imf measured china s economic development by purchasing power parity ppp and estimated that china s gdp per capita was about 2 000 but at that time china s nominal gdp per capita was only 300 in 1996 the imf issued a report also measured in ppp estimating that china s gdp per capita was about 6 000 to 7 000 while the nominal gdp was only about 500 this changed in the late 1990s when china launched a series of reform measures affecting real estate health care education pensions and the like at the core of this economic modernization was in fact the process of monetization housing previously not counted in nominal gdp was brought into the economy via the reform as was medical service before the economic reforms health care was treated as a public good the concept of costs and revenue didn t apply and all was borne by the political system the market reforms subjected all such public services to monetization thus bringing up nominal gdp in china s current economic development the advantages brought by these three factors have been basically exhausted the process of economic monetization has been completed export growth is difficult to sustain and the wealth generated by monetary easing and investment via governmental loans can t match the intrinsic value of those investments the sino u s trade war real estate bubble and financial crisis are just symptoms of the structural limitations that form the root cause of china s economic troubles much has been made of china s transition from low level manufacturing to high tech industries over the last decade china has definitely progressed on this front but it s still far from being competitive enough to support continued rapid economic growth since 2018 chinese state media have been boasting about the four new inventions but one of them the bike sharing venture is on the verge of bankruptcy like bike sharing the rest of the four new inventions are mainly innovations of service models and don t actually feature cutting edge technology it is difficult to significantly overhaul industry without a strong tech innovation sector which china still lacks ten years ago the city of ningbo in southeastern china announced a fantastical plan to manufacture one or two hundred steve jobs style technological innovative figures according to peter drucker an austrian born u s management consultant educator and author who has been described as the founder of modern management the biggest enemy of innovation and entrepreneurship is authority and central planning china s state planning is the biggest obstacle to innovation and entrepreneurship moreover the basic values of china s authoritarian system assume that the political elites have more wisdom and perspective than ordinary citizens this attitude stifles innovation making it unlikely that china can produce even one jobs style entrepreneur under the current model of development let alone upgrade its entire industry central planning is good for developing countries because it can set basic goals and reach them but once this phase is over central planning becomes a liability not an asset while the chinese regime elites continue to defend this system and arrogantly proclaim its superiority the actual result is an economic quagmire zang shan is an international affairs analyst specializing in u s and china affairs
now when a deal with international monetary fund imf is being concluded it seems that the balance of payment crisis bop may be controlled however due to some tough conditions imposed by the fund pakistan will witness further soaring of inflation and economic slowdown in short run that will be bringing unemployment along with other impediments pakistan which joined the imf in 1950 has had 21 bailouts since then its most recent loan was issued in 2013 worth 6 6 billion there are some positives along with several negatives implications if a country comes under imf program that is why countries who opts such program try to complete it successfully with a mission not to avail the same time and again imf works like any other lending institution who actually gives loans to the parties those can repay the same timely therefore to make sure repayments timely the fund works closely with financial managers of the country to formalize such economic patters which may help securing the loan together with improvements in particular departments which can earn more revenue that otherwise may be not taxation central bank regulatory measures for exchange rate and energy are some of these departments which are actually responsible either to earn revenue or in bringing economic indicators to its real value as these segments involves huge amount of subsidies and governmental control to check inflation and economic activities therefore deficit financing pops us which bring country into a debt trap imf conditions undo these actions taken by the government and it slowdowns the economy and due to subsidies to hold back inflation triggers that bring more people under the line of poverty imran khan new financial team seems to be more sophisticated who are master of their work and know what to do for the goals to achieve however there are concerns that these technocrats are imported from world bank and imf which may bring and support imf agenda present government before coming into power used slogan to no to let imf rule pakistan but afterwards it changes everything this is not only in case of pakistan but it happens other part of the world where political parties initially shouted against imf went into imf bailouts right after assuming power is it be venezuela egypt or elsewhere now talking about pakistan presently discussed bailout will be 22nd instance which means either previous governments were not committed to end supporting economy of pakistan with subsidies or to reduce balance of payment crisis through bringing down trade deficit hence controlling foreign exchange and inflation artificially pti when assumed power had one big emergency to deal with i e economic emergency on one side of this emergency like situation they need to focus on repayments due in immediate two fiscal years whereas on the other side they need to reduce balance of payment crisis which is due to ever increasing trade deficit resulting from widening the gap between import and exports after assuming power pti first finance minister mr asad umer seemed to have three point agenda before going to imf first to bring pakistan towards real value of economy i e devaluation of currency that resulted in inflation to increase which further resulted in high interest rate scenario and slowed down the economy but it reduces current account deficit remarkably secondly he reduces subsidies gradually which ofcourse felt by general public and import based businessmen at large third agenda was to bring loss making public institution into going concern and then to privatize the same on higher price through wealth management idea what he miscalculated was timing of imf bailout and tax revenue which resulted badly on his career as finance minister therefore to address the same he tried to reintroduce tax amnesty scheme which becomes bone of contention among the members of federal cabinet prime minister imran khan then replaced him with an experienced professional mr hafeez shaikh as advisor to pm for finance who then bring his own team for central bank and federal board of revenue opposition is claiming that the team is imposed by imf as surety and it is government s surrender to the fund s demands new financial managers of pakistan have good resume indeed mr hafeez shaikh is phd in economics having 30 years of experience in policy making management and implementation and remained finance minister of pakistan from 2010 2013 whereas he also severed world bank and taught at harvard university he brought in mr reza baqir as governor state bank a harvard graduate phd in economics from university of california and was senior resident representative for egypt he was head of debt policy division during his tenure with imf as he is lead arranger for recent imf program in egypt therefore there are some concerns that new imf bailout may be on the same pattern as of case of egypt new finance team also have syed shabbar zaidi as chairman federal board of revenue who was senior partner of af ferguson and a the most senior tax expert in pakistan he also remained provincial minister in caretaker government and author of many books including panama leaks imran khan new financial team seems to be more sophisticated who are master of their work and know what to do for the goals to achieve however there are concerns that these technocrats are imported from world bank and imf which may bring and support imf agenda to be continued the writer is an economist corporate finance specialist and a chartered banker uk

unique event this is the new normal benner township needs to adopt new strategies to deal with a new climate in the short term we need to create a literal rainy day fund to deal with climate related emergencies in the long term we need to update the township s zoning ordinance to reflect the new reality another top priority is police protection unlike neighboring spring and patton townships benner does not have its own police force instead relying on the state police for law enforcement a plan is now in place in harrisburg to charge municipalities like ours for state police protection under the current formula benner would have to pay over half a million dollars a year whether share the spring township police force continue to use the state police or create our own police force we re going to have to find a way to pay for it finally our township s residents are concerned about the current board s efforts to use a rezoning effort to reduce environmental protection for spring creek which is the jewel of centre county and the state s top trout fishing stream i want to see our environmental protections maintained which will also involve mean anticipating the effects of

find a solution that works for everyone ways to improve communication facebook email options update township website police coverage the state has been pushing for local municipalities to pay for police coverage this under the latest proposal would cost benner township 160 000 plus this cost would require a tax increase options need explored to prevent or lessen that burden that would be put on the residents of the township some of the options i believe will need explored partner with spring township for police coverage can the county sheriff be used to provide service is the state fee the best option and what do we get when paying for coverage zoning changing the zoning to allow for more housing in the ag and forested zones as well as the lack of environmental regulations and the changes to the spring creek canyon overlay will have long term effects with more development the township character will change more services will be expected roads will need improved more employees will be expected taxes would probably increase to cover these changes development is going to happen but balance and an eye to the future is required and needed i will work to find this balance larry

and enhance quality of life while facilitating responsible growth and maintaining harmony between rural and urban areas in an efficient and responsible manner for all its citizens this mission statement is supported by a number of goals that help focus my and hopefully the township s efforts of those my top three priorities of the six currently proposed are to promote economic re development activities that increase citizen access to quality work opportunities while maintaining the township s tax base to insure the availability and access to adequate and affordable housing for every resident and to facilitate township growth while protecting and preserving the environment and maximizing the use of public infrastructure none of the above can occur in exclusion of any of the

president donald trump has heightened tensions with china by escalating his tariffs on 200 billion in chinese goods from 10 to 25 as a tool of national policy tariffs had long been fading into history a relic of the 19th and early 20th centuries that most experts came to see as harmful to all nations involved yet more than any other modern president trump has embraced tariffs as a punitive tool against europe canada and other key trading partners but especially against china the second largest economy after the u s the trump administration asserts and many independent analysts agree that beijing has deployed predatory tactics to try to give chinese companies an edge in such advanced technologies as artificial intelligence robotics and electric vehicles beijing s tactics the u s contends include hacking into u s companies computers to steal trade secrets forcing foreign companies to turn over sensitive technology in exchange for access to china s markets and unfairly subsidizing chinese companies trump has also complained angrily about america s gaping trade deficit with china for which he blames weak and naive negotiating by previous u s administrations last july trump began gradually imposing tariffs on chinese imports after friday s increase the administration is now imposing 25 tariffs on 250 billion in chinese goods beijing has counterpunched by taxing 110 billion of american products focusing on agricultural goods notably soybeans in a calculated effort to inflict pain on trump supporters in the farm belt a look at what tariffs are and how they work ___ what exactly are tariffs tariffs are a tax on imports they are typically charged as a percentage of the transaction price that a buyer pays a foreign seller to use a simplistic example ignoring real world minimum amounts subject to tariffs say an american retailer buys 100 garden umbrellas from china for 5 apiece 500 total and suppose the u s tariff rate for the umbrellas is 6 5 percent the retailer would have to pay a 32 50 tariff on the shipment thereby raising the total price from 500 to 532 50 in the united states tariffs sometimes also called duties or levies are collected by customs and border protection agents at 328 ports of entry across the country proceeds go to the treasury the tariff rates are published by the u s international trade commission in the harmonized tariff schedule which lists u s tariffs on everything from dried plantains 1 4 percent to parachutes 3 percent sometimes the u s will impose additional tariffs on imports that it determines are being sold at unfairly low prices or are being supported by foreign government subsidies ___ what are tariffs supposed to achieve two things increase government revenue and protect domestic industries from foreign competition before the federal income tax was established in 1913 tariffs were a big money raiser for washington from 1790 to 1860 tariffs produced 90 percent of federal revenue according to douglas irwin an economist at dartmouth college by contrast tariffs in recent years have accounted for only about 1 percent of federal revenue tariffs are meant to raise the price of imports or punish foreign countries for unfair trade practices like subsidizing their exporters and dumping their goods at unfairly low prices they discourage imports by making them costlier they also reduce pressure from foreign competition and make it easier for home grown companies to raise prices as global trade grew after world war ii tariffs fell out of favor the formation of the world trade organization and the forging of trade deals like the north american free trade agreement reduced or eliminated tariffs the average u s tariff is now one of the lowest in the world 1 6 percent the same as the european union s the pew research center reports ___ are tariffs a wise policy most economists say no tariffs raise the cost of imports for people and companies that need to buy them and by reducing competitive pressure they give u s producers leeway to raise prices too that s good for those producers but bad for almost everyone else rising costs especially hurt consumers and companies that rely on imported parts some u s companies that buy steel for example complain that trump s tariffs on imported steel leave them at a competitive disadvantage their foreign rivals can buy steel more cheaply and offer lower priced goods in 2002 president george w bush s administration placed tariffs on imported steel a study financed by steel consuming businesses found that the tariffs cost 200 000 american jobs that year more broadly trade restrictions make an economy less efficient with lesser competition from abroad domestic companies lose the incentive to increase efficiency or to focus on what they do best ___ animated explainer on trade disputes ___ follow paul wiseman on twitter at
islamabad pakistan s talks with the international monetary fund imf on a bailout package remained inconclusive on friday dashing expectations that the government was ready to sign on the dotted line in a late night message the finance ministry said only that we have made good progress in our discussions with the visiting imf mission consultations will continue over the weekend the talks were originally planned for conclusion on friday and the imf mission had confirmed return flights to washington dc late in the night those travel plans have presumably been modified both the government team and the imf staff mission remained evasive and unavailable to the waiting media persons on a day of hectic consultations as they were seen repeatedly coming in and out of the q block the seat of the ministry of finance and imf s resident mission an informed source said a steep monetary adjustment and fiscal realignments were the key sticking points holding back a final outcome and the imf had not changed its stance since october last year official spokesman dr najeeb khaqan avoided all contact with reporters throughout friday and did not take calls finance secretary muhammad younas dagha told journalists that the adviser to the pm on finance office was the right forum to comment on the imf talks final deal remains elusive despite marathon talks all day a senior source said pm s adviser on finance dr abdul hafeez shaikh was trying his best to reach a consensus before markets reopen on monday while avoiding haste in setting performance targets that may not last beyond a couple of quarterly reviews these are really serious matters and need serious approach the source said there were also some reports that the visiting mission was taken to the pm office for an interaction with pm imran khan but finance ministry officials denied this they said dr hafeez shaikh and other officials met the prime minister but the imf team did not accompany them imf resident representative in islamabad teresa daban sanshez when reached late night to ask if talks had been concluded and with what outcome said there is not planned any interaction with media during the imf discussions sic no comment was her repeated response while she moved past reporters in her numerous forays into and out of q block the building where the meetings went on all day she did not respond if the mission was extending visit informed sources said the imf mission had taken an unusually aggressive posture this time not seen since late 1990s and wanted pakistan to commit to an upfront adjustment plan along with deep rooted and wide ranging structural reforms to secure the bailout this adjustment according to the imf should be supported by major increases in electricity and gas rates and quick recovery plan for bleeding public sector entities and explanations to some untouchable expenditures the combined adjustment over the next two years is estimated about 3 5pc of gdp including through energy sector circular debt capping plan the government is under pressure to include the full cost of imported lng into the weighted average cost of natural gas and over rs201bn recovery from power consumers immediately in addition to gas and electricity rates raised a couple of months ago by up to 30pc and 15pc respectively the imf wants the next year s tax revenues to expand significantly to close to rs5 3tr from the target of about rs4 4tr this year strengthening the central bank s autonomy in line with the international best practices a market based floating exchange rate and reduction in the debt ratio are some of the key areas of the framework that would become an integral part of the next year s budget already facing criticism over rising inflation amid higher energy prices the government s major concern was the political and economic costs of the painful programme it can hardly afford to have public protests like those in some european countries therefore it wanted to delay any further increase in electricity gas and petroleum rates to ensure reasonable gaps the sources said the protracted engagements since september october last year also showed an unusually difficult programme because of not so friendly geo political situation as evident from a parallel challenge from financial action task force a pakistani team that may include dr hafeez shaikh and secretary dagha to engage with fatf is expected to depart later next week published in dawn may 11th 2019

reconciliation pages of course you could find our earnings release and reconciliations of all non gaap financial measures referred to in our remarks also on our website before proceeding to talk about our results let me take a minute to talk about the announcement we made last week about my cancer diagnosis as we mentioned i have stage ii pancreatic cancer thankfully the medical team at johns hopkins has seen this many times before they believe we have caught it early that it is operable and that the course of treatment is proven i m grateful for all the messages of support from the investment community as well as from marriott s community of associates and business partners around the world with the support of an extraordinary strong team of marriott executives we are going to soldier on now last month we opened our 7 000th property the 27 storey st regis hong kong after opening this landmark hotel our development pipeline at quarter end totaled roughly 475 000 rooms compared to 463 000 rooms at the end of the first quarter 2018 gross room openings totaled nearly 19 000 rooms in the first quarter compared to 15 000 rooms in the year ago quarter net room openings were almost double from the number from the prior year almost 216 000 rooms in our pipeline or 45 are already under construction largest number of under construction rooms in our industry at our current pace of openings our under construction pipeline represents the equivalent of 2 5 years of embedded gross rooms growth the remainder of our pipeline represents another 2 5 years of growth our legacy starwood brands account for roughly 30 of our development pipeline among our 17 luxury and upper upscale brands the rooms pipeline for the sheraton brand is second only in size to the marriott brand in the first quarter of 2019 we opened four new sheraton hotels and signed three new sheraton deals including the new built 250 room sheraton hotel in bradenton florida more than a quarter of sheraton s existing portfolio is under or has committed to renovation our limited service brands are growing rapidly globally our limited service pipeline largely upscale brands include more than 285 000 rooms nearly 2 5 times the number of pipeline rooms in those brands five years ago outside north america our limited service pipeline is now nearly 3 5 times its size in 2014 we are growing these brands in markets around the world with a variety of approaches from modular construction to urban high rises to multi brand hotel complexes we are developing new prototype designs for fairfield inn and towneplace suites to better suit smaller markets and we continue to add development talent to make these deals happen because the growth opportunity is meaningful we see evidence that owners and franchisees prefer our brands according to str more than one in three rooms that are under construction in the us today will fly one of our flags and while our existing distribution globally is more modest still one in five hotel under construction globally will be flagged with marriott brand we continue to expect to see net rooms growth totaling approximately 5 5 in 2019 with room deletions of about 1 to 1 5 we deleted 3 000 rooms in the first quarter of 2019 i visited several markets in china in late march the big news there is marriott bonvoy and alibaba less than two years ago we formed a new joint venture with alibaba to improve service and sales for chinese guest in the first quarter of 2019 property revenue from our newly designed alibaba channel more than tripled year over year while the level of marriott bonvoy enrolments in china doubled over the prior year quarter we are excited to welcome these new members to our hotels around the world marriott bonvoy offers guests the largest and most compelling collection of hotels and experiences at the end of the first quarter membership at marriott bonvoy reached nearly 130 million worldwide up roughly 5 million from year end 2018 approximately 40 of the new signups came from china worldwide loyalty redemption revenue at our hotels rose at a double digit rate in the first quarter we recently announced our home rental initiative in a survey we conducted in 2018 we found that over one quarter of our loyalty program members who responded had used home rentals in the prior years during our home rental pilot in 2018 which was available in a few european cities nearly 90 of our guests who are marriott bonvoy members and over 80 are traveling for leisure the average length of stay in our pilot was more than triple that for the hotel typical hotel guest with the successful european pilot we decided to launch homes and villas by marriott international offering guests access to a growing number of premium and luxury homes and villas in over 100 destinations across the us europe the caribbean and latin america our commitment to providing travelers with full residences including kitchens and other amenities guided our selection of homes our desire to complement our core hotel offerings similarly influenced our selection of markets we will work with select property management companies who are already managing these homes and estimate roughly 40 of these markets we are launching in are new to marriott we believe our highly curated home rental product fully integrated into our loyalty program for earning and redeeming points really enhance marriott bonvoy member travel experiences and increase the value of our loyalty program home rental should enable our loyalty members to stay with marriott throughout any travel experience allow us to leverage our strong brands and expertise in an evolving competitive landscape and ultimately drive a greater share of wallet for our portfolio in april we signed a new multi year agreement with expedia which should enhance our leisure packaging platform vacations by marriott and leverage expedia s technology for a new business opportunity to be launched in the fourth quarter of 2019 with the changes in the agreement we expect our owners and franchisees will see improved overall economics from the relationship in the first quarter worldwide house profit for comparable company operated hotels increased an impressive 1 6 while the integration is largely complete our hotels continue to benefit from synergies associated with the starwood merger on the revenue side we reduced discounting at legacy starwood hotels in the first quarter and across our system increased the proportion of bookings coming from our digital channels direct digital revenue bookings at our hotels globally increased over 20 in the quarter and now represent over 30 of room nights revenues booked on our mobile app increased more than 70 year over year while our revenues booked on otas worldwide declined 4 yielding ota business helped hotel profitability even as it likely depressed our first quarter revpar growth by a few tenths of a percentage point our global revpar index rose 1 basis points in the quarter let s talk briefly about the regions systemwide constant dollar revpar in our asia pacific region increased 3 in the quarter revpar growth was strong in india japan indonesia and in the major markets in greater china but was somewhat offset by weaker results in south korea thailand and the hainan island market in china in the second quarter we expect mid single digit revpar growth in the region with fewer headwinds from south korea and hainan island future revpar performance will depend somewhat on the economic impact of ongoing us china trade negotiations particularly in markets that rely on manufacturing while we await the outcome of those negotiations our forecast assumes asia pacific revpar will increase at a mid single digit rate for the full year 2019 in the middle east and africa systemwide constant dollar revpar declined 4 year over year revpar growth in the uae declined 8 on flat demand because supply growth in dubai increased by 11 at the same time revpar in cairo and the red sea resorts rose sharply on strong eastern european demand for the second quarter we expect emea revpar will again decline albeit less significantly than in the first quarter significant supply growth in dubai is likely to persist but we should see stronger demand in the holy cities in saudi arabia ramadan started may 6 10 days earlier than last year which should push some business travel in the region from second quarter to later in the year for the full year we expect revpar will decline at a low single digit growth in the emea region in europe systemwide constant dollar revpar rose 2 in the first quarter us travel to many markets in europe was strong with considerable numbers of loyalty redemptions revpar in london increased by 4 year over year at the same time brexit uncertainty kept many uk travelers at home constraining growth in many warm weather european destinations travelers avoided center city paris due to the continued yellow vest demonstrations with the biennale in venice beginning this month and strong us demand expected to continue in most markets we believe revpar in europe will increase at a mid single digit rate in the second quarter and for the full year in the caribbean and latin america regions systemwide constant dollar revpar increased nearly 4 in the quarter in the caribbean revpar rose 8 on strong demand as several us airlines increased lift to the islands revpar growth in brazil was very strong on record demand during carnival in rio de janeiro while continued travel warnings took revpar in mexico down 3 looking ahead we expect revpar growth in cala will moderate a bit increasing at a low single digit rate in the second quarter and full year as competitor hotels reopened in the caribbean systemwide revpar north america rose nearly 1 in the first quarter revpar was constrained by the partial federal government shutdown in january tough comparisons to hurricane recovery in florida and houston and the lingering impact from the fourth quarter labor strike in hawaii excluding these factors we estimate our systemwide revpar growth would have been roughly 70 basis points better than the reported number our revpar index in the us increased nearly 100 basis points in the first quarter group revpar across north america increased 3 on strong citywide demand in atlanta in san francisco and the favorable impact of the timing of easter while easter timing will present a headwind for group business in the second quarter the negative hurricane and government shutdown impact should be behind us our group revenue booking pace for the full year 2019 is flat new bookings for 2019 increased in the first quarter and surged in april so we expect group revpar will be higher for the year first quarter transient revpar from our largest 300 corporate accounts in north america rose 3 but overall transient revpar was flattish in the first quarter largely due to weak demand in march given this we expect north american revpar will increase by 1 to 2 in the second quarter and 1 to 3 for the full year marriott is a dynamic company we created a powerful lodging portfolio managing and franchising across the highest value tiers with the starwood acquisition we recognized that we are in a unique position to truly delight sophisticated frequent travelers with an unparalleled loyalty program and a wide range of travel experiences the more our guests are engaged in our loyalty program the more profitable business opportunities we can pursue even outside the traditional lodging space such as credit card and residential branding this year we expect to earn 440 million to 450 million in credit card and residential branding fees incidentally credit card sign ups rose 20 in the first quarter year over year in addition to unit additions and revpar growth such opportunities should drive higher returns to our shareholders even as we retain our asset light approach to business before turning the call over to leeny oberg let me take a moment to recognize our extraordinary investor relations leader laura paugh we announced this morning that laura will retire from marriott at year end laura paugh is nearly 40 years at marriott have literally included our entire history of modern day investor relations when she began marriott like many other companies did not even do quarterly earnings calls such as this one she has not only built this discipline for us she has been recognized by you as one of the best investor relations professionals in the entire public company universe not just the hospitality space she has been a partner a mentor and a friend to me for over 20 years of involvement in investor relations all of us are grateful for her service and expertise thank you laura now for some more thoughts about first quarter performance and our outlook let me turn things over to leeny kathleen oberg chief financial officer executive vice president thank you arne i too would like to express my deep appreciation for laura s countless contributions and dedication to our company her strategic insights and determination to get the right answers have no doubt contributed meaningfully to our shareholder value over the years well i will personally miss her a great deal i know you will all join me in wishing her a very happy retirement and celebrating her accomplishments during the rest of this year now onto the results for the first quarter of 2019 adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled a 1 41 compared to 1 34 in the year ago quarter this was 0 08 over the midpoint of our guidance of 1 30 to 1 35 largely due to better than expected windfall tax benefit and other favorable discrete items on the tax line recall that in the prior year quarter adjusted eps included 0 11 from gains on hotel sales gross fee revenues totaled 895 million or 6 increase year over year largely due to unit growth and higher incentive fees and credit card branding fees incentive fees increased 5 with good margin performance and strength at our florida and california resorts during their strong season credit card fees alone totaled 93 million up 8 while other non property fees totaled 39 million with the stronger us dollar first quarter fee revenue reflected nearly 7 million of year over year unfavorable impact from foreign exchange net of hedges owned leased and other revenue net of expenses totaled 50 million in the first quarter a 20 million decline from the prior year due to 21 million of lower termination fees general and administrative expenses totaled 222 million compared to 247 million in the prior year quarter g a in the first quarter of 2018 included a 35 million expense for the supplementary retirement savings plan contribution first quarter adjusted ebitda rose 7 year over year to 821 million consistent with our 6 to 10 growth guidance while not included in adjusted ebitda expenses associated with last year s data security incident totaled 44 million in the first quarter netted against 46 million of insurance recoveries we expect gross fee revenue for the second quarter will total 990 million to 1 01 billion a 4 to 6 increase over the prior year our second quarter fee revenue estimate assumes higher credit card branding fees but modestly lower incentive fees due to property renovations and unfavorable foreign exchange we expect owned leased and other revenue net of direct expenses will total roughly 80 million in the second quarter while g a should be 225 million to 230 million our guidance assumes no further asset sales in 2019 beyond those that have already been completed these assumptions yield 1 52 to 1 58 diluted earnings per share for the second quarter recall that the second quarter last year included 0 26 in gains from the sale of hotels adjusted ebitda in the second quarter should total 940 million to 965 million flat to up 3 over the prior year for the full year 2019 we believe gross fee revenue could increase 6 to 8 over the prior year with about 15 million over our last guidance due to stronger expected incentive fees we believe incentive fees will increase at a mid single digit rate for the year and continue to expect our credit card and residential branding fees will total 440 million to 450 million in 2019 last year our gross fees were constrained by strikes in several markets in the fourth quarter owned leased and other revenue net of direct expense should total roughly 285 million to 295 million for the year a roughly 40 million decline year over year termination fees totaled 69 million in 2018 and we expect such fees will 25 million to 30 million in 2019 a bit improved from our prior forecast for this year results from our marriott homes and villas business will be included in the owned leased and other line and are expected to be immaterial g a should total 920 million to 930 million for 2019 about 10 million higher than our last estimate due to higher bad debt expense and admin spending these assumptions yield 5 97 to 6 19 diluted earnings per share for 2019 recall that the prior year included 0 65 in gains from the sale of owned and joint venture assets adjusted ebitda should total 3 615 billion to 3 715 billion 47 over 2018 adjusted ebitda and estimate that is unchanged from last quarter as we discussed last quarter our 2019 guidance does not include merger related costs and the timing impact of reimbursed revenues and expenses investment spending for the year could total 600 million to 800 million including roughly 225 million of maintenance spending the remainder includes capital expenditures loan advances equity investments and contract investments roughly a quarter of our total investment spending relates to systems initiatives that should be reimbursed over time we repurchased nearly 8 million shares from january 1 through may 8 for nearly 1 2 billion and continue to expect to return at least 3 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in 2019 this assumes no further asset sales during the year our balance sheet remains in great shape at march 31 our debt ratio was within our targeted credit standard of 3 times to 3 5 times adjusted debt to ebitdar we have modeled our 2019 income statement and cash flow forecast at a 3 3 times target now laura would like to add a few remarks laura e paugh senior vice president of investor relations thanks leeny and thanks for all the kind things both you and arne have said i have to say that the best part of my job at investor relations at marriott is working with some very talented colleagues ir is a team effort not only including the gifted betsy dahm and laura pearce but many many people throughout the organization including the broad senior management team when we talk about the collaborative nature of marriott culture it is not a story we have a very good time in ir as i think you can tell we laugh a lot we love working with arne and leeny they are just the smart forthcoming and engaged as they seen the other best part of my job in ir is working with all of you i m always someone s here i m always happiest when the phone rings and you want to talk about marriott our competitors the otas the economy or your summer vacations and many years i ve done ir i ve seen the market move from unreasonable exuberance to irrational despair and back i know you face meaningful pressure to deliver results and i hope i have helped to you as you evaluated the company i ll be here through the end of the year and look forward to seeing many of you in person at conferences and meetings in the next few months so let me answer your questions so we can speak to as many of you as possible we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow up as if that s possible we will take your questions now questions and answers operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of david katz of jefferies david katz jefferies analyst hi afternoon everyone arne m sorenson president and chief executive officer hey david kathleen oberg chief financial officer executive vice president good afternoon david katz jefferies analyst i have to admit i had probably four or five questions in my head and i m struggling to remember any of them i just wanted to wish all of you the best but what i did want to talk about is we ve started to get into a range where just industrywide some of the metrics have started to be a bit choppy and yet the cash generation remains powerfully strong if we were to paint a scenario and i don t think you got quite this draconian at your analyst meeting but if we were to start to talk about revpar that was down call it 2 to 5 have you sort of penciled out what the cash would look like and how your decision process would be altered under those kinds of circumstances and i m again not calling or wishing for it just thinking out loud arne m sorenson president and chief executive officer yeah i think maybe we can jump in here i think the best place for you to refer in terms of the financial model is to what we shared with you at the investor relations meeting and you can do some of your own calibration of that and make some assumptions and probably be fairly close we don t have a model other than that one that we shared with you then and i guess i d just say thematically that while march was a disappointing month in many respects it is to us not a harbinger of a predictably different environment and the one that we ve been going through the last few quarters sort of thematically today i think we would say it s steady as she goes for the next few quarters we continue to see that when we adjust for hurricanes and strikes and holidays and the like that were spoken along broadly between broadly around 1 5 sort of revpar growth we might have been at inaudible to two shy of that in the first quarter 2019 but there is some good news too we talked about good april bookings for example in group a very strong performance for us for the month and so while you should do whatever modeling you think is appropriate and make whatever forecast you think is appropriate i think our caution to all of us would be let s just expect for now that we re going to keep going in sort of the pace we ve been going in the last few quarters kathleen oberg chief financial officer executive vice president the only thing i ll add david is and we did do a model that actually did assume a 5 decline in revpar as part of what we talked about at security analyst meeting and i ll point out a couple of things one we re obviously far less dependent on your classic north american incentive fees when you look at both our growth internationally as well as the credit card fees and then second of all i ll talk that even in the great recession we ended up with the lowest year being 3 growth in net rooms and so when you continue to see that steady strong rooms growth and a clearly less volatile franchise and management fee stream i think it bodes well for really strong cash generation if we were looking at a recession david katz jefferies analyst great and my one follow up literally is you made reference to bad debt expense which i just looking back quickly i m not sure that we ve seen that in some of the prior quarters what s in there kathleen oberg chief financial officer executive vice president for sure that s part of g a and that s obviously when you end up with let s say a terminated hotel but as part of what happens you end up not getting all of your reimbursed cost back it is in the g a line it can be a little bit lumpy it s a really small number but then obviously as we ve said this year for our g a as part of the increase in the overall g a that we forecast for the company about 5 million of that is from bad debt that s related to a few international hotel situations in middle east africa and asia pacific that i think the easiest way to describe is one off situation but as you might imagine the bad debt number for the company overall is way immaterial david katz jefferies analyst understood thank you and again all the best arne m sorenson president and chief executive officer thank you kathleen oberg chief financial officer executive vice president thank you operator our next question comes from shaun kelley of bank of america shaun kelley bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi good afternoon everyone i d like to yes say my best wishes to you arne on a speedy recovery and congratulations to laura on what s been an incredible career so my question will be on just going over to the revpar performance that you saw in the quarter i think as we look through the metrics that you provide the numbers that stand out to us where we look through the legacy starwood brands i think most of those at least on the full service side seem to underperform some of the chain scale averages and some of the performance that we saw in the marriott legacy brands i know these numbers bounce around and we re always wants to pick it little patterns but could you just elaborate a little bit on that and i think arne in your prepared remarks you may have mentioned something about reduction of discounting so did that drive some of that revpar performance or what should we expect going forward as you continue your integration path arne m sorenson president and chief executive officer yeah i think there are a few different factors that are going into this but it s a perfectly fair question one of the things i think we start with here is geographic distribution so if you look at smith travel industrywide numbers for q1 you see a 4 point difference in revpar performance between the top 25 markets and all others top 25 markets in the us according to smith travel were down roughly 1 1 full percent ph in revpar the other markets were up 3 so you ve got 4 point difference in revpar performance between those markets obviously that s industry as a whole that s not marriott s portfolio uniquely and i think when you look at marriott in its entirety compared to some others in the industry or when you look at some of the starwood brands compared to some of the marriott brands i think you will find that we are much more concentrated in the top 25 markets and that is inevitably part of this when we look at marriott brands legacy versus starwood brands legacy we can see a couple of other things that are happening one is the strike carryover in hawaii particularly where our bookings are a little bit longer window first quarter was continued to have some strike impact even though the strikes were done that is disproportionately impacting the starwood hotels i think the second would be around otas and we called out in the prepared remarks that ota business is down 4 for the combined portfolio in q1 interestingly the starwood hotels were about 10 points more reliant on otas in this than the marriott hotels were and as we ve gone to one reservation system in one sort of unified revenue management strategy the shift if you will from reliance and those third party otas to internal digital channels probably cost a little bit we thought it s maybe a few tenths of a point for the portfolio as a whole the impact there is probably a bit more disproportionate on the starwood hotels and then there are some changes on other discounting starwood and deeper discount packaging that marriott did not have that s probably had an impact in it but you roll all those things together those are probably the principal drivers of the difference in the averages beneath of course the portfolio as a whole you re going to have individual stories with individual assets shaun kelley bank of america merrill lynch analyst and i guess the my quick follow up would then be just any changes you guys think about the broader integration process and i know when the deal was originally contemplated i think there were some down the road revenue synergy opportunities that you are probably envisioning just kind of how you think about those in the context of what you re actually able to deliver right now arne m sorenson president and chief executive officer yeah i think the time is right for that i mean we ve got the combined loyalty program launched it is in market and being marketed we ve got strong credit card sign ups we ve got strong share of wallet growth i think there s a lot we can look at now to be optimistic about the future and i think it s time to deliver the revenue upside shaun kelley bank of america merrill lynch analyst thank you very much operator our next question comes from the line of jared shojaian of wolfe research jared shojaian wolfe research analyst hi everybody thanks for taking my question jjust to stick with the same line of questioning i mean you called out revpar index being up a 100 basis points and we saw a pretty sizable increases from your peers as well so i guess is the conclusion that the independents are just meaningfully losing revpar share right now and then on that idea how do you think about the value proposition of branding today versus in the past i guess presumably there s more value for our owners today than there s really ever been and does that give you the ability to push royalty rates a little bit harder arne m sorenson president and chief executive officer i mean obviously you won t hear us speak unbiased about the value of branding we think we deliver extraordinary value to our owner and franchisee partners by plugging them into a system with the loyalty program in a very efficient reservation system that delivers substantial business to them at meaningfully less cost then would be the case otherwise but i don t think you need to take our word for if you look at what s happening with the development pipeline and we ve talked about some of those statistics that we re about 7 of the global industry today with something like 20 of the hotels under construction heading toward our brands so you can see investors owners of real estate moving with their fee because i think they see the strength of that i think the other thing to remind everybody and we don t want to get defensive sounding and we don t want to get too technical on revpar index our revpar index is a really important tool particularly when you re looking at an individual hotel and how it s performing and its competitive set but it is not the only measure that is out there to assess how portfolios are performing in the wake of acquiring starwood we have found that many of our competitive sets include many of our own hotels because there will be concentration particularly in some of these urban markets where we ve got significant number of full service hotels and so we re measuring our performance against our own hotels not exclusively because we ve got to have some others that are in there and similarly we are seen to some extent others who are competing in markets that we don t exist in and so if you think about the secondary or some of the tertiary markets our brands are not broadly distributed in those markets and as a consequence we don t have the impact maybe of newly ramping hotels in those markets or of competition maybe against some of the relatively weaker brands all things put together we are actually gratified in the midst of a massive integration that in the midst of all of that we still managed to take about a 100 basis points index growth both in the united states and globally in the first quarter of 19 jared shojaian wolfe research analyst great thank you and just on the pipeline is down quarter over quarter for the first time in several years i know we shouldn t read too much into one quarter s worth of pipeline data but i think the pipeline last year and so far this year is growing quite a bit slower than your 7 gross unit growth so can you talk about that and maybe what you re hearing from developers right now arne m sorenson president and chief executive officer i don t think we very modest i think we calculated 0 8 decline in the pipeline from quarter end q4 is a trend we opened well in the first quarter always at the end of the year we probably have a little bit more culling of the pipeline than we do at other times and typically q1 will be the slowest signings quarter part of that is because you ve got to go through a reauthorization of the franchise circulars in most states all those things combined led to that modest negative in q1 and we don t think we re necessarily see that in the quarters ahead but having said that we are we ve said now for at least a couple of years that sort of steady state organic growth particularly in the united states is flattish we are i think continuing to take share maybe even building a little bit momentum of momentum but in the ninth or tenth year where recovery with cost increases in construction and labor and length of the construction cycle even though financing is high and the absolute returns are quite good i don t expect we ll see a meaningful ramp up for example in development in the us i think instead we will be sort of poking along at flat levels substantial but flat levels and growth quarter over quarter or year over year is going to depend a lot on what happens in the rest of the world jared shojaian wolfe research analyst all right thank you and laura congratulations to you well deserved and arne my best wishes to you for a quick recovery arne m sorenson president and chief executive officer thank you laura e paugh senior vice president of investor relations thank you operator our next question comes from the line of joe greff of jpmorgan joseph greff jpmorgan chase co analyst good morning but inaudible conference call good afternoon arne m sorenson president and chief executive officer okay multiple speakers joseph greff jpmorgan chase co analyst i guess 1 00 pm is better than 4 30 pm on a friday more specially arne we wish you the best heartfelt and laura congratulations we will definitely miss you laura e paugh senior vice president of investor relations thank you joseph greff jpmorgan chase co analyst my question most of my questions have been answered but the one question i have is regarding the development pipeline what percentage of the pipeline is north america or us top 25 markets full service and what percentage of that would be financed or under construction arne m sorenson president and chief executive officer we will have to go back to you on this i think about 40 of the global pipeline is luxury and upper upscale so it s a pretty healthy mix which is in the higher segment i am certain that the percentage in the us only which is luxury and upper upscale is meaningfully lower than and that us may skew toward for us upscale principally not upper mid scale we don t really have the upper mid scale space am i close kathleen oberg chief financial officer executive vice president in the pipeline when we re looking at the full service pipeline it s about 10 of overall 475 000 of the global pipeline of the north america pipeline it s about 20 joseph greff jpmorgan chase co analyst thank you so much arne m sorenson president and chief executive officer and i don t think we can give you the top 25 versus other markets with the information we ve got here kathleen oberg chief financial officer executive vice president obviously full service joseph greff jpmorgan chase co analyst thanks you arne m sorenson president and chief executive officer okay thanks operator our next question comes from the line of david beckel of bernstein david beckel sanford c bernstein co analyst thanks a lot for the question i d also like to echo the sentiments or well wishes arne and congrats laura on a tremendous career my question my first question has to do with revpar cadence given q1 results q2 guidance of course there is some timing issues but back half implies sort of a pretty healthy acceleration particularly in the us you talked a little bit about group strength giving you some confidence that will materialize but there are there any other one time items to be aware of there with respect to the calendar and more generally what gives you the confidence that demand in revpar will sort of seemingly reaccelerate through the back half of the year arne m sorenson president and chief executive officer i think is one thing we can be probably annually blamed for i suppose and that is we often keep our range of full 2 points and so obviously we started the year 1 to 3 we re still at 1 to 3 after the first quarter and if we were actually comparably precise in each quarter as the year went along we would narrow that range more and more because the more quarters put in the book the less likely it is that you re either going to hit the bottom or the top end of that and i think that could be said here too but maybe they get to the opposite fundamental point our internal i guess if you were to take it sort of single point revpar forecast is essentially right in the middle of that range and so that tells you that basically when we re looking at trends in bookings and group bookings and year over year comparability issues the most obvious in the fourth quarter of course being the strikes which we ve had to struggle through in the fourth quarter 2018 but hopefully we will not in the fourth quarter of 2019 all of those things get us to a place where we think it is sort of the midpoint of that 1 to 3 years about the best prediction that we can make it does suggest that in part because of comparability issues and because of bookings maybe were a bit better in the second and in last two quarters than in the first two quarters but not a dramatically different scenario and it s not are sitting here saying we re going to have a different kind of economic environment than the one we have today david beckel sanford c bernstein co analyst great thanks for the color there and just a quick follow up i know it s capex increased by about 100 million can you give a little color as to why the increase kathleen oberg chief financial officer executive vice president sure basically we re up the midpoint about 100 million and it is a combination of little bit higher systems initiatives which will actually be reimbursed over time from our owners as well as a loan for a particularly valuable management agreement that s going to result in a meaningful property improvement program that will bring a hotel up to really fantastic brand standard for that brand david beckel sanford c bernstein co analyst great thank you very much operator our next question comes from the line of smedes rose of citi smedes rose citigroup analyst hi thanks and arne glad to hear that you re in a good hands and laura it is not going to be the same without you look forward to catching up offline with you i wanted to ask just you mentioned on your opening remarks a new design for towneplace and fairfield ends i think targeted at smaller markets i m just wondering is that answering some sort of unfilled demand that your developers are asking you to do are you trying to be more competitive with the products that are already targeting the smaller markets or kind of maybe what s what does it mean for those i guess for the pipeline for those two products arne m sorenson president and chief executive officer i think it s actually both but there and i sense there the same issue we have heard from a number of our franchisees that they want to expand in secondary and some even tertiary markets where at fairfield or at towneplace we set 80 or 90 rooms instead of that 125 or 130 rooms is the better better positioning for those markets and while we ve had the ability of course to shrink the number of rooms in our hotel if you re not shrinking the public space in a way that s commensurate with that and you re probably putting us a product that s a little bit over built in that market and so we want to do something with those partners who want to grow in those markets to make sure that we ve got something which is true to the brand but cost effective for them and competitive with the competing product that might be there and obviously you can see we ve got a lot of different companies that participate in the select service space particularly and if you look at the tertiary markets you ll see that we are probably less distributed there than many other companies in the united states smedes rose citigroup analyst okay thanks and then just listening to all the hotel reit the new expedia contractors come up some it sounds like more than just it s a little more nuance than just sort of lowering the commissions and it s more about more control if maybe the way the rooms are put into the ota systems can you just provide maybe some just broad strokes that maybe just kind of the changes in the contract or how arne m sorenson president and chief executive officer obviously we are now i don t even know what round of new contract is with expedia but we ve been renegotiated these contracts for nearly 20 years i suppose i don t like that end and there is a similarity to some extent with each of them but i think on some level we continue to look for cost effectiveness we look for data transfer ability the ability to understand who the customer is and have the systems understand who the customer is we look at inventory control which is can we yield our inventory can we make sure we re pricing our inventory on our own platform in a way that doesn t necessarily have to be offered up in every other platform and those things were on the table here too and of course we would expect expedia or another ota to one off in the opposite of what we want certainly as it relates to the level of the commission that s probably the clearest to see but i think we are grateful for where we got with expedia we do think it will deliver economic benefits to our owners we also think we are we don t have much to say about this today you have to stay tuned but we do have an idea with them with expedia that we think is attractive to both of us maybe an incremental place for them to make some economics in our space but also the space in which they can actually deliver more cost effective solutions to us than some of the solutions that are available to us today and so we re pleased with the outcome that we ve got and look forward to seeing what we can accomplish with it smedes rose citigroup analyst okay thank you arne m sorenson president and chief executive officer you bet operator our next question comes from the line of anthony powell of barclays anthony powell barclays bank analyst hi happy friday everyone and obviously well wishes to you arne well wishes to you laura thanks for your help and openness over the years arne m sorenson president and chief executive officer thank you anthony powell barclays bank analyst so that the house profit margin increase in north america on pretty modest revpar wasn t positive in the quarter i think you ve targeted 50 basis points of hotel level margin growth from the merger are you believe in that currently and do you think that could lead to upside to your incentive fee growth projection of 6 to 10 over the next few years kathleen oberg chief financial officer executive vice president so couple of things we basically have achieved in every year since we ve acquired starwood 50 basis points of at least 50 basis points of margin improvement apart from revpar in 17 18 and it s our goal to do that again in 19 and quite frankly anthony if our goal to do it again in 20 so i think whether it is from purchasing or from what we ve seen in the loyalty program to productivity synergies to above property synergies through the psf we ve been thrilled with what we ve been able to do and quite frankly with the hard work that the properties have put in to making it a reality so we do continue to see the benefit and i think you re seeing that come forth in the incentive fees and in the profits of the hotels anthony powell barclays bank analyst got it so i think in your in your investor day you said 6 to 10 of growth over the next few years is that still the target or there may be upside to that kathleen oberg chief financial officer executive vice president yeah i think for now using what you ve got in the security analyst meeting is just right anthony powell barclays bank analyst got it okay just one more kathleen oberg chief financial officer executive vice president we certainly hope to beat it anthony powell barclays bank analyst got it and just on the home rental business is this more of an offering or amenity for core customer or do you think this stimulates scale to something that s meaningful in terms of financials for you over the next few years arne m sorenson president and chief executive officer well time is going to tell i mean we re taking a different strategy obviously than the number have we are not we want to we know that what we offer in this space our brand must stand behind that nobody is going to excuse us from a bad experience in a home and villa rental kind of experience we re not going to blame the host they re going to say marriott you put me in a product that was not clean or something else happened in that space and so that s one thing that we ll make will have an impact under the size of business long term the second thing we re doing is we re really looking at the whole home market we re not looking at a studio apartments we re not looking at extra bedrooms we re looking at something which is meaningfully different from a traditional hotel room for obvious reasons we think it makes them more complementary to the hotel space that we re in we also think it helps fill on a gap if you will one of the gaps that arguably we ve had is that when larger families whether that s a single nuclear family or an extended family are traveling together hotels are not necessarily always the easiest place to be because there may not be places for them together outside of the public spaces of the hotel and the more we can do something that solves both of those the better off we think we are i think though even define that way it is a big market and a market that we can grow in we obviously don t expect that there will be a material financial impact in 2019 we wouldn t tell you to build anything in this model until we get smarter about it in the years ahead but we re really excited about it and we are really eager to learn what we can learn in this space anthony powell barclays bank analyst great thank you arne m sorenson president and chief executive officer you bet operator our next question comes from the line of bill crow of raymond james bill crow raymond james analyst yeah good afternoon folks and obviously i m sure the sentiment that s already been said and laura 20 years of trying to make me better i appreciate your efforts i m not sure they work but i appreciate them arne my question is really on the select service and the limited service space whether you think the consumer today is more discerning and what they re looking for and whether that s put older properties at a significant disadvantage to newly opened properties arne m sorenson president and chief executive officer it s a good question good question for lots of reasons i mean i think the the full service hotels have still got a very meaningful advantage they ve got function space they ve got a presence that a typical select service hotel can offer often a food and beverage range that a select service hotel can offer and they can continue to be i think quite competitive particularly in the right kinds of markets i think at the same time you see select brands and we ve got a number of these i think about moxy and ac and aloft and element just to name a few that come right to mind that are interesting they can be lively they can be with energized bar space or lobby space or maybe even flex food and beverage space and if they re in urban locations they give a better alternative i think in some respects than the relatively lower rated hotels that might have been in the same market in a past generation if they existed there in the first place and so we ll watch this altogether obviously one reason these brands are growing so well as i think our franchise partners see them and say this is a pretty interesting new mousetrap and we want to be part of experimenting to see how this works i think ultimately all these hotels can be successful and if they re positioned right and if they re true to their brands i think some of the newer select brands have the ability to punch above their weight in terms of rate per square footage which i think will make them stronger over time and ultimately where the growth settles is going to depend a little bit on that return and that return is both about current cash return for development costs but it s also about capital preservation and what assets are going to hold their value the longest and that s still often going to be urban main and main kinds of locations that may deliver a little less percentage of cash flow return but are going to hold their value extraordinarily well bill crow raymond james analyst okay i ll leave it there thank you arne m sorenson president and chief executive officer you bet operator our next question comes from the line of patrick scholes of suntrust patrick scholes suntrust analyst good afternoon let me just also reiterate arne hopes for a quick recovery arne m sorenson president and chief executive officer thanks patrick patrick scholes suntrust analyst and laura congratulations well deserved laura e paugh senior vice president of investor relations thank you patrick scholes suntrust analyst a question you had talked about occupancy taking a bit of a hit in the quarter i guess less use of third party otas is this something that we would expect to continue throughout the year and then is it also fair to think that s on the flip side it certainly benefits owned hotels including yours as well as imfs arne m sorenson president and chief executive officer i mean i think we have seen probably some of this in the last few quarters we certainly in the marriott legacy marriott portfolio even before the integration of the reservations platforms we have started to do some yielding of our inventory off of third party sites when we predicted we didn t need that business and so i suspect as we get further into the year we will see some lapping of what we did in the past i think what is accelerated probably a bit is with going to one reservations platform as we brought the starwood hotels in sort of one fell swoop onto a little bit more aggressive approach that way and so we think we ll probably see some impact of that we re going to watch this i mean obviously we don t want to turn away business if it s incremental to us what we want to do though is make sure we re set up to maximize profitability of hotels in long term and well we ve talked about this before well revpar is the single measure which is most available in the industry it is not the measure which is the most important which is what kind of profits are you driving from the performance of that hotel as you compete for owner capital and as we ve said before we re quite compared to sacrifice a few tenths on the top line if it makes sense to drive enhanced profitability on the bottom bottom line kathleen oberg chief financial officer executive vice president the only additional i will add to that is that i would not expect it to the second part of your question i would not expect to materially impact only profits patrick scholes suntrust analyst okay thank you for the clear explanation operator our next question comes from the line of robin farley of ubs robin farley ubs investment bank analyst great thank you i want to add my best wishes for arne and laura quite selfishly i m bummed that laura is leaving because as many years of i ve been doing this i always learned something when i talk to laura so i think for all of us are understanding that the industry is going to be diminished by you going but don t let that stop you i know well deserved so my question is on incentive management fees i wonder if you could give us sometimes you give color on kind of what percent of hotels are paying versus the previous peak kind of in north america and then just with the guidance for incentive management fee declines in q2 you mentioned that s renovations it seems like something that a renovation disruption might be more than one quarter phenomenon but your full year guidance is still for that up mid single digits for the incentive management fees so i wonder if you could just talk to us about how like what s the sort of specific to q2 but not necessarily an issue in later quarters about that thank you kathleen oberg chief financial officer executive vice president sure absolutely so let s first talk about percentage ownership on incentive fees and in q1 in 19 versus 18 it was up 300 basis points so 56 versus 53 a year ago first quarter so fits nicely with the discussion that we ve been having relative to margins and also international hotel growth relative to the full year last year 18 was up about a point over 17 it s too soon for us to kind of get into percentages for all of 19 but i think clearly the trend is moving in the right direction so couple of things i ll mention on incentive fees in q2 one of the things that s going on in q2 in incentive fees is fx we have expected that fx albeit it s a little bit less bad than we expected a quarter ago a quarter ago we said 15 to 20 now we ve got closer to 10 we do expect that negative fx impact which clearly hits incentive fees to be largely in the first half so we are expecting a chunk of that to be in q2 and then you add on to that the reality that in q1 we had a bunch of resorts that we re getting this extra strong incentive fees and then layer on top of that renovation and easter and that s where you get this overall change in the direction of the incentive fees in q2 robin farley ubs investment bank analyst okay great that s very helpful thank you operator our next question comes from the line of thomas allen of morgan stanley thomas allen morgan stanley analyst hey good afternoon and best wishes on a speedier recovery arne and laura good luck in your retirement arne m sorenson president and chief executive officer thank you thomas allen morgan stanley analyst so at the beginning in your prepared remarks you talked about 2 5 years of embedded growth just in the hotels in construction and another 2 5 years in the pipeline is that saying for the kind of 5 5 to 6 growth you re guiding is that what you re implying arne m sorenson president and chief executive officer yeah i guess so yeah i don t know that we exactly went back and tested the net unit growth number and obviously the 5 5 is net of deletions not updating the deletions forecast but really simply looking at you look at the volume of rooms in that pipeline and it looks about five years worth of growth kathleen oberg chief financial officer executive vice president and it s assuming just a steady pace of openings so it just that today s pace you got a lot of stuff in the pipeline it s consistent with what we talked about in security analyst meeting which obviously you d expect higher room openings in 21 than you would expect in 19 but it is all consistent with this pipeline be at 478 or 475 thomas allen morgan stanley analyst okay perfect and then just since you announced homes and villas what have you heard from owners arne m sorenson president and chief executive officer they re curious of course they re deeply interested in where we re going with this obviously 2 000 homes and villas is a substantial increase from what we were doing last year but it is not a significant number by itself when you compare to either the size of the hotel system we have today or even the number of hotels we open every week and so it s less a question really about what are we doing today than what might we be doing in the future and i think as we go forward we re going to make sure we re communicating with them and taking on board there their interest i think our owners are not monolithic so it would be it would be wrong to say that every one of them has exactly the same point of view i do think there are many of them that acknowledge that this is irrational step for us to take and if they were in our shoes they d be doing exactly the same thing i think broadly they appreciate the value of the loyalty program and know that this can enhance the loyalty program which is to benefit not just to the homes and villas of business but it s also to the benefit of the hotel business and i think owners generally have a point of view which is they d like to grow with us but maybe have nobody else grow with us so that they can make sure that they capture as much of our customer base as they possibly can i think they understand philosophically that s not a world that they can t necessarily have but you put all that through the grinder and i think we ve got a very constructive set of conversations with our owners and i m sure we ll be able to navigate this through with them well thomas allen morgan stanley analyst helpful thank you arne m sorenson president and chief executive officer you bet operator our next question comes from the line of michael bellisario of baird michael bellisario robert w baird co analyst good afternoon arne m sorenson president and chief executive officer hi there michael bellisario robert w baird co analyst all the best to both of you arne and laura laura e paugh senior vice president of investor relations thank you michael bellisario robert w baird co analyst you gave us a 3 number i think is on the transient side for your largest accounts i mean did you see any different trend with some of your smaller accounts and any differences between kind of larger and smaller customers in terms of the booking behavior that you saw kathleen oberg chief financial officer executive vice president yes i wouldn t say anything notable happily some of our biggest customers like the professional services areas things like that they were up meaningfully some of the areas that you would expect so i don t think there any particular trend of the larger versus smaller but certainly professional services is an example it was up very strong michael bellisario robert w baird co analyst and then you mentioned i think you called that a surge in group bookings in april what was the profile of that customer that was being more aggressively with their forward looking bookings kathleen oberg chief financial officer executive vice president well there actually that was group that we were talking about that was group bookings which obviously can cover a range everything from associations to government to corporations and it was quite strong in the corporate what i think one of the things that we were very pleased to see is that it was that the surge was both in the year for the year as well as for all future periods which was always very encouraging michael bellisario robert w baird co analyst that s helpful thank you arne m sorenson president and chief executive officer you bet operator our next question comes from the line of kevin kopelman of cowen company kevin kopelman cowen and company analyst hi thanks a lot and first of all best wishes to you arne and congrats to laura arne m sorenson president and chief executive officer thanks kevin laura e paugh senior vice president of investor relations thanks kevin kevin kopelman cowen and company analyst i just had a quick one can you talk about free cash flow trends that you re seeing and that kind of one time payment that you had in the first quarter and how you re expecting free cash flow trend for the year thanks kathleen oberg chief financial officer executive vice president the one time payment you re referencing and you are talking about insurance costs related to kevin kopelman cowen and company analyst profit sharing last year kathleen oberg chief financial officer executive vice president that was profit sharing within the year ago first quarter so in that respect we were talking about kind of year over year trends in g a because obviously last year was weighted down by the 35 million you could be talking about the profit sharing from our working capital changes kevin kopelman cowen and company analyst sorry i m talking about the outflow for accrued payroll and benefits kathleen oberg chief financial officer executive vice president yes and that is just a function of the fact that as you remember we accrued for the supplemental benefit last year but we actually paid it out in first quarter into our associates accounts and then second of all we also moved up our profit sharing timing from q3 to q1 so when you look at the working capital use of cash in q1 relative to normal it looks particularly heavy and that s because of about 200 million worth of timing differences in the cash flow kevin kopelman cowen and company analyst got it and then just a follow up typically your loyalty program has been a source of cash and you talked about how it might be different this year and you did have strong i think redemptions in the first quarter so any change to the outlook there for this year kathleen oberg chief financial officer executive vice president yes so good question and again to finish off the rest of your earlier question otherwise in terms of the overall flow of cash it s really the same as we expressed in the first quarter so no fundamental change we obviously haven t presumed any asset sales pretty similar yes i would say loyalty might be between 50 million and 100 million negative use of cash this year as compared to more neutral where we were a quarter ago but that s also offset by a little bit higher net income so you put that all together with maybe ever so slightly higher debt borrowings and we end up in exactly the same place and all of those i would say are in 50 million to 75 million so really kind of fine tuning more than any fundamental change kevin kopelman cowen and company analyst okay got it thanks so much kathleen oberg chief financial officer executive vice president thank you operator our next question comes from the line of wes golladay of rbc capital markets wesley golladay rbc capital markets analyst hello everyone i just got a quick question on conversions now that bonvoy has been launched and the programs that you ve been integrating are you seeing increased interest from owners to convert to marriott brands arne m sorenson president and chief executive officer i think it s certainly at least steady if not up a bit yes i think the demand both for new build and for conversions is comparable i think the feedback we re getting from our owners is very positive i think there have been questions already obviously about margins which we ve talked about i think there is maybe not unanimous but broad recognition that we re delivering incremental margin performance because of what we ve built here and i think there is broad understanding that the revenue lift should come behind it and not only an absolute revenue lift but a mix of revenue sources which is more cost effective than sold the level of conversations we re having with our current and prospective partners are very robust kathleen oberg chief financial officer executive vice president and in certain markets that are more revpar challenged like middle east for example we re very encouraged with some of their conversion activity we see going on there were the benefits of the strong revenue pipeline of our brand it s viewed as very attractive as well as the margins wesley golladay rbc capital markets analyst and can i get one more question looking at the limited service the underperformance this quarter was a little bit more pronounced and i assumed some of that was related to the relief efforts last year is that true and how do you expect these gap between full service to trend throughout the year arne m sorenson president and chief executive officer yes it s a good question i think the limited services partly geographic distribution maybe a little bit for us partly hedged product i suppose maybe for courtyard which we re working on but i don t see a dramatic difference in performance between the segments as the year goes on wesley golladay rbc capital markets analyst thank you very much and best wishes and thanks for everything arne m sorenson president and chief executive officer thank you operator our final question will come from the line of vince ciepiel of cleveland research vince ciepiel cleveland research company analyst great thanks and best wishes to both arne and laura i have two questions and both are related to share of wallet one pertaining to starwood marriott deal and the second on home sharing so first on starwood marriott you obviously have this base of legacy marriott loyalty members starwood loyalty members and i m curious what inning you think we re in of increasing share of wallet within those bases of legacy members what type of overlap you re seeing with the legacy marriott staying and with starwood properties employees first i guess maybe a simple way of capturing it is i think you ve noted loyalty is 50 of the business now how high do you think that could get arne m sorenson president and chief executive officer well i m not sure we actually know the answer to the second one a couple of comments on absolute penetration of loyalty and then maybe finish with what inning we are in it was interesting to us that when we acquired starwood and looked at the way the calculation was done for loyalty contribution of hotels starwood was 7 or 8 points higher than marriott was principally because the calculation was done differently and we have synthesized those calculations now so that they are the same and actually the loyalty contribution of the starwood hotels looks a whole lot more or like what it does for the marriott hotels and there are some arcane things in there about whether you count for example points in eligible room that came in through an ota channel that has a loyalty number attached to it where maybe they can earn points from food and beverage or you don t and we don t so there are a bunch of things that go into that calculation as we said we re at about 50 of all of our rooms are coming from our loyalty programs we think that number will grow we are i think in a very early inning well our customers who are both starwood and marriott customers i think were pleased when we allowed linkage of the loyalty programs on the day of close to now have one single program means they don t have to go two separate sites if you will to see what the options are in the other legacy portfolio and that means the customers are just in the last few months now for the first time going on and looking at whatever destination they maybe going to and seen a meaningfully broader selection to choose from than they did before and it means that we are seeing folks who might have driven farther for that spg hotel or driven farther for that marriott rewards hotel before now having options that are a little bit closer to them and they ll be some trading sort of back and forth in both directions which i think net net should drive share of wallet and maybe not disproportionately impact either one we did put in our prepared remarks that redemption volume has gone up significantly i think that is a powerful sign that people are seeing the value of the choices that are available and so it s hard to put an inning on it but i would say it s very early in the game in terms of the revenue lift and the lift available from the bonvoy program okay i guess the operator told us you were last thank you very much for being so patient with us we obviously trying do these things in the morning for obvious reasons we had our board meeting and shareholders meeting this morning and we are trying to fit an awful lot in in the same day and so thanks for waiting until friday afternoon for us we appreciate your interest in us congratulations laura once again we ll have you for another few quarters here but laura e paugh senior vice president

islamabad pakistan s talks with the international monetary fund imf on a bailout package remained inconclusive on friday dashing expectations that the government was ready to sign on the dotted line in a late night message the finance ministry said only that we have made good progress in our discussions with the visiting imf mission consultations will continue over the weekend the talks were originally planned for conclusion on friday and the imf mission had confirmed return flights to washington dc late in the night those travel plans have presumably been modified both the government team and the imf staff mission remained evasive and unavailable to the waiting media persons on a day of hectic consultations as they were seen repeatedly coming in and out of the q block the seat of the ministry of finance and imf s resident mission an informed source said a steep monetary adjustment and fiscal realignments were the key sticking points holding back a final outcome and the imf had not changed its stance since october last year official spokesman dr najeeb khaqan avoided all contact with reporters throughout friday and did not take calls finance secretary muhammad younas dagha told journalists that the adviser to the pm on finance office was the right forum to comment on the imf talks final deal remains elusive despite marathon talks all day a senior source said pm s adviser on finance dr abdul hafeez shaikh was trying his best to reach a consensus before markets reopen on monday while avoiding haste in setting performance targets that may not last beyond a couple of quarterly reviews these are really serious matters and need serious approach the source said there were also some reports that the visiting mission was taken to the pm office for an interaction with pm imran khan but finance ministry officials denied this they said dr hafeez shaikh and other officials met the prime minister but the imf team did not accompany them imf resident representative in islamabad teresa daban sanshez when reached late night to ask if talks had been concluded and with what outcome said there is not planned any interaction with media during the imf discussions sic no comment was her repeated response while she moved past reporters in her numerous forays into and out of q block the building where the meetings went on all day she did not respond if the mission was extending visit informed sources said the imf mission had taken an unusually aggressive posture this time not seen since late 1990s and wanted pakistan to commit to an upfront adjustment plan along with deep rooted and wide ranging structural reforms to secure the bailout this adjustment according to the imf should be supported by major increases in electricity and gas rates and quick recovery plan for bleeding public sector entities and explanations to some untouchable expenditures the combined adjustment over the next two years is estimated about 3 5pc of gdp including through energy sector circular debt capping plan the government is under pressure to include the full cost of imported lng into the weighted average cost of natural gas and over rs201bn recovery from power consumers immediately in addition to gas and electricity rates raised a couple of months ago by up to 30pc and 15pc respectively the imf wants the next year s tax revenues to expand significantly to close to rs5 3tr from the target of about rs4 4tr this year strengthening the central bank s autonomy in line with the international best practices a market based floating exchange rate and reduction in the debt ratio are some of the key areas of the framework that would become an integral part of the next year s budget already facing criticism over rising inflation amid higher energy prices the government s major concern was the political and economic costs of the painful programme it can hardly afford to have public protests like those in some european countries therefore it wanted to delay any further increase in electricity gas and petroleum rates to ensure reasonable gaps the sources said the protracted engagements since september october last year also showed an unusually difficult programme because of not so friendly geo political situation as evident from a parallel challenge from financial action task force a pakistani team that may include dr hafeez shaikh and secretary dagha to engage with fatf is expected to depart later next week published in dawn may 11th 2019
giddy up president trump has fulfilled another campaign promise to confront china and hold firm as promised three decades of donald trump s intense commitment to stop the exfiltration of amerian wealth is on display today when you plant your tree in another man s orchard don t be surprised when you end up paying for your own apples u s trade representative robert lighthizer u s treasury secretary steven mnuchin u s commerce secretary wilbur ross and u s president donald trump are confronting chinese chairman xi jinping and vice chairman liu he and now consequential things get economically very serious there are going to see multiple geopolitical background moves now as the confrontation shifts to the painful phase who can outlast the economic standoff washington dc negotiations to end the us china trade war came to a surprisingly early close in washington on friday with no signs of a deal reportedly just hours before the chinese delegation will return to beijing us treasury secretary steven mnuchin told reporters at noon that the talks had been constructive as he left the us trade representative s office where negotiators held their latest round of talks in an attempt to end a months long trade dispute more steel your nerves we ve waited decades for this as most cth readers are aware lighthizer has focused heavily on the enforcement mechanisms within the trade talks apparently when the 150 page draft agreement was presented to the chinese politburo beijing balked at allowing the u s to hold controlling enforcement over the trade agreement terms the fallback presentation from vice chairman liu was we cannot put the binding enforcement mechanisms in writing you ll have to trust us to honor the agreement at which time lighthizer said no way however lighthizer and trump are not only fighting china they are fighting u s politicians who are beneficiaries of china they are also fighting against the u s coc the multinational corporations wall street and members of both political parties who desperately want to stop any trade balance reset almost half perhaps more than half of congress has a better financial self interest if china can gain economic superiority over the united states this congressional hearing and the severity of lighthizer toward those purchased politicians highlights this very tenuous internal challenge stop and think about this again the u s economic trade and manufacturing system is so structurally broken after three decades of severe corruption by corporate financial interests almost half perhaps more than half of congress has a better financial self interest if china can gain economic superiority over the united states the likely response from china will be additional tariffs on u s goods and or refusal to purchase u s agriculture products their strategy will be to get key big ag senators and the u s chamber of commerce to target fire toward president trump over diminished farm prices cth anticipated this dynamic in 2016 any chinese pull back from u s farm purchases hits the wall street multinational corporations hardest multinational corporations big ag are now invested in controlling the outputs of u s agricultural industry and farmers this process is why food prices have risen exponentially in the past decade the free market is not determining price there is no supply and demand influence within this modern agricultural dynamic food commodities are now a controlled market just like durable goods the raw material harvests writ large are exploited by the financial interests of massive multinational corporations because the domestic supply side agricultural market is based on perishable goods this predictable chinese response has a rapid downstream impact the wholesale price of domestic food drops rapidly inside the u s as the supply now exceeds the market the multinational mega food conglomerates will be apoplectic the prices of imported durable goods stuff from china will increase slowly over time depending on the supply chain for the specific product sector however if china retaliates by stopping import of u s agriculture products the prices for u s domestic highly consumable goods drops quickly in this scenario wall street is hardest hit other than the ag sector main street and the u s consumer therein actually benefits the big club will go bananas there are trillions at stake it is simply incredible how president trump has taken his 2015 2016 proposals and made them current policy absolutely proving he was right go back and read this from february 2016 it s stunning how he was able to deliver on the plan what you will find in all of donald trump s positions is a paradigm shift he necessarily understands must take place in order to accomplish the long term goals for the u s citizen worker as it relates to entitlements or structural benefits all other politicians begin their policy proposals with a fundamentally divergent perception of the u s economy they are working with and retaining the outlook of a u s economy based on services a service based economic model consequently their forecasted economic growth projections are based on ever increasing foreign manufacturing dependency and even more solidifying service based economics while this economic path has been created by decades old u s policy and is ultimately the only historical economic path now taught in school candidate donald trump intended to change the course entirely because so many shifts policy nudges have taken place in the past several decades few academics and even fewer msm observers are able to understand how to get off this path and chart a better course president trump has begun a process for less dependence on foreign companies for cheap goods the cornerstone of a service economy and a return to a more balanced u s larger economic model where the manufacturing and production base can be re established and competitive based on american entrepreneurship and innovation no other economy in the world innovates like the u s a president trump sees this as a key advantage across all industry including manufacturing the benefit of cheap overseas labor which is considered a global market disadvantage for the u s is offset by utilizing innovation and energy independence the third highest variable cost of goods beyond raw materials first labor second is energy president trump unleashed the u s energy sector and slashed regulations as a consequence the u s manufacturing price of any given product now allows for global trade competition even with higher u s wage prices in addition the u s has a key strategic advantage with raw manufacturing materials such as iron ore coal steel precious metals and vast mineral assets which are needed in most new modern era manufacturing trump proposed we stop selling these valuable national assets to countries we compete against they belong to the american people they should be used for the benefit of american citizens period example currently china buys and recycles our heavy steel and light aluminum metal products for pennies on the original manufacturing dollar and then uses those metals to reproduce manufactured goods for sale back to the u s president trump stopped this process with global steel and aluminum tariffs and shifted the dynamic to where we do the manufacturing ourselves with the utilization of our own resources and we use the leverage from any sales of these raw materials in our international trade agreements when we combine full resource development in a modern era with with the removal of over burdensome regulatory and compliance systems necessarily filled with enormous bureaucratic costs president trump has proven we can lower the cost of production and be globally competitive in essence trump changed the economic paradigm and we are no longer a dependent nation relying on a service driven economy in addition an unquantifiable benefit comes from investment where the smart money play to get increased return on investment becomes putting capital into the u s economy instead of purchasing foreign stocks with all of the above opportunities in mind this is how trump takes us back to the pathway of rebuilding our national infrastructure the demand for labor increases and as a consequence so too does the u s wage rate which has been stagnant or non existent for the past three decades as the wage rate increases it is and as the economy expands it is the governmental dependency model is reshaped and simultaneously receipts to the u s treasury improve more money into the u s treasury and less dependence on welfare programs have a combined exponential impact you gain a dollar and have no need to spend a dollar that is how the ssi and safety net programs are saved under president trump when you elevate your economic thinking you begin to see that all of the entitlements or expenditures become more affordable with an economy that is fully functional as the gdp of the u s expands so too does our ability to meet the growing need of the retiring u s worker we stop thinking about how to best divide a limited economic pie and begin thinking about how many more economic pies we can create simply put we begin to make america great again

in the long run it is in the best interests of china and the united states to negotiate a trade deal china s exports provide a large part of her economic growth and employment and replacing us markets is a near impossibility mainland goods give the us consumer excellent value and agricultural exports fill the coffers of politically important midwestern farmers but the long run is an undefined variable when attempting to change a system that has given china a distinct advantages in trade and commerce founded in a long ago era of development it was never going to be easy for the us to change china s behavior particularly as every prior american administration settled for cosmetic agreements that failed to address the crucial problem of enforcement the trump white house is the first administration to try and it was almost inevitable that substantial economic pain would be required to convince the chinese of the virtues of a different future one way to define the cost and perceived future cost of a prolonged tariff dispute between china and the united states is to look at their respective equity markets and currencies since the trade confrontation began in earnest january 2018 the s p 500 and the shanghai composite have taken very different paths all quotations are closing prices as of friday may 10th in late january 2018 the s p index reached a then record of 2872 87 after a volatile year with the index falling as low as 2 581 88 on april 4th it scored another peak on september 21st at 2 929 67 the prolonged collapse of equities in the fall of that year took the s p down 19 7 to a finish of 2 351 10 on the day before christmas the return in the new year has been even more dramatic and the index set a new record on april 30th at 2 945 83 reuters since the threat and imposition of additional tariffs by the united states at the close on friday may 10th of 2 881 40 the average has lost 2 2 it is a very different story for the shanghai composite its peak aside from the massive bubble in 2015 at 5 166 35 which arose and vanished in six months was in january last year at 3 558 13 the rest of 2018 was one long decline as the sparring over trade between the us and china and the setting of competing tariffs took an incessant toll by january 2019 the shanghai composite has lost 30 7 to 2 465 29 on january 2nd the revival this year was a trade talk boom as both sides voiced optimism and a deal seemed to be inching nearer the index soared to 3 270 79 on april 19th that was an astonishing 32 7 above the january 2nd low in four months the chinese equity investors stand behind no one in their tolerance of volatility however as the trade picture has soured the index plunged from april 19th to may 9th it shed 12 8 in three weeks reuters the comparison between the us dollar and the chinese yuan cny bears the same stamp as the trade conflict began early last year the yuan began to devalue but it started from its strongest point since august 2015 in the second half of 2017 the yuan had gained substantially against the dollar from 6 9060 in the early part of may by february 7th 2019 the onshore yuan cny was trading at 6 2649 a 9 3 increase in nine months the yuan then dithered for six weeks as the opening fusillades of the conflict whistled through the markets when it became clear that the us was serious and intent on changing the basic trade equation the yuan started to sink in earnest it is important to remember that the yuan is a managed currency its movement is not the result of traders decisions but is the public expression of chinese trade and monetary policy whatever conclusion the trade dispute will eventually offer the chinese government was deliberately making the yuan cheaper as a means of countering the us duties and as a notice to the trump administration that both sides have trade weapons reuters from 6 2781 on march 27th the yuan rocketed lower to 6 9330 on august 15th a 10 4 devaluation a further fall to 6 9737 by october 31st brought the total loss to 11 1 and the weakest the yuan had been against the us currency since may 2008 positive trade sentiment brought it back to 6 6844 on february 25th but the subsequent failures have returned it to 6 8217 with the largest fall the week of may 6th after the us threat to increase tariffs the us dollar index dxy has had no appreciable impact from the us china trade dispute from a low in february 2018 of 88 59 the index moved higher throughout the year to 96 69 on august 15th a 9 1 gain a fall in late summer and a lunge higher brought the index to the year s high of 97 54 on november 12th reuters the late year plunge in equites brought the dxy to 95 39 on january 10th but since then it has been a steady winner reaching 98 17 on april 24th that is a 10 8 increase over the february 2018 low the market judgement could not be clearer on the domestic and the international stages the sensitivity of the yuan and the shanghai composite to the trade issue with the united states is graphic reuters for the chinese investor confidence is heavily dependent on the outcome of the us argument the composite is 16 above its post bubble low of 2465 29on january 2nd a level that stemmed from the trade dispute and its effect on the mainland economy a breakdown in the trade talks with the promise of a long and painful bout of tariffs and export shrinkage might well drive the shanghai composite back to the range of 2013 and 2014 the deliberate devaluation of the yuan in the face of us trade pressures is a warning to the us but it is a weak one american consumers will have to pay a bit more for many chinese sourced products but they will have no problems finding alternatives china s hard won position as the workshop and assembly shop for many global industries is already under competitive threat a prolonged trade war if it comes to that will speed up the shift of existing manufacturing elsewhere and make new foreign investment far less likely it is difficult to know how much influence domestic investor opinion has on the politburo standing committee in beijing but whatever there is can only press for an agreement with the united states
washington president trump has heightened tensions with china by boosting tariffs on 200 billion worth of chinese goods from 10 percent to 25 percent and his administration is threatening to again raise tariffs u s trade representative robert lighthizer said friday that mr trump ordered us to begin the process of raising tariffs on essentially all remaining imports from china which are valued at 300 billion as a tool of national policy tariffs had long been fading into history a relic of the 19th and early 20th centuries that most experts came to see as harmful to all nations involved yet more than any other modern president mr trump has embraced tariffs as a punitive tool against europe canada and other key trading partners but especially against china the second largest economy after the u s the trump administration asserts and many independent analysts agree that beijing has deployed predatory tactics to try to give chinese companies an edge in such advanced technologies as artificial intelligence robotics and electric vehicles beijing s tactics the u s contends include hacking into u s companies computers to steal trade secrets forcing foreign companies to turn over sensitive technology in exchange for access to china s markets and unfairly subsidizing chinese companies mr trump has also complained angrily about america s gaping trade deficit with china for which he blames weak and naive negotiating by previous u s administrations last july mr trump began gradually imposing tariffs on chinese imports here s a look at what tariffs are and how they work what exactly are tariffs tariffs are a tax on imports they are typically charged as a percentage of the transaction price that a buyer pays a foreign seller to use a simplistic example ignoring real world minimum amounts subject to tariffs say an american retailer buys 100 garden umbrellas from china for 5 apiece 500 total and suppose the u s tariff rate for the umbrellas is 6 5 percent the retailer would have to pay a 32 50 tariff on the shipment thereby raising the total price from 500 to 532 50 in the united states tariffs sometimes also called duties or levies are collected by customs and border protection agents at 328 ports of entry across the country proceeds go to the treasury the tariff rates are published by the u s international trade commission in the harmonized tariff schedule which lists u s tariffs on everything from dried plantains 1 4 percent to parachutes 3 percent sometimes the u s will impose additional tariffs on imports that it determines are being sold at unfairly low prices or are being supported by foreign government subsidies what are tariffs supposed to achieve two things increase government revenue and protect domestic industries from foreign competition before the federal income tax was established in 1913 tariffs were a big money raiser for washington from 1790 to 1860 tariffs produced 90 percent of federal revenue according to douglas irwin an economist at dartmouth college by contrast tariffs in recent years have accounted for only about 1 percent of federal revenue tariffs are meant to raise the price of imports or punish foreign countries for unfair trade practices like subsidizing their exporters and dumping their goods at unfairly low prices they discourage imports by making them costlier they also reduce pressure from foreign competition and make it easier for home grown companies to raise prices as global trade grew after world war ii tariffs fell out of favor the formation of the world trade organization and the forging of trade deals like the north american free trade agreement reduced or eliminated tariffs the average u s tariff is now one of the lowest in the world 1 6 percent the same as the european union s the pew research center reports are tariffs a wise policy most economists say no tariffs raise the cost of imports for people and companies that need to buy them it s official we re freaked the american apparel footwear association said in a statement friday as an industry we cannot survive a 25 percent tariff on top of the tariffs that we already pay rick helfenbein who heads the trade group said in the statement prices at retail will rise sales will drop and jobs will be lost from an administration that promised jobs jobs jobs this is a cinderella tale that has gone awry it offers no glass slipper and no way out for years to come tariffs by reducing competitive pressure give u s producers leeway to raise prices that can good for those producers but bad for almost everyone else rising costs especially hurt consumers and companies that rely on imported parts some u s companies that buy steel for example complain that mr trump s tariffs on imported steel leave them at a competitive disadvantage their foreign rivals can buy steel more cheaply and offer lower priced goods more broadly trade restrictions make an economy less efficient with lesser competition from abroad domestic companies lose the incentive to increase efficiency or to focus on what they do best heightened trade tensions between the u s and china including higher tariffs will weaken consumer and business confidence in the context of an already slowing global economy elena duggar an assistant director at moody s investors service said in a statement construction transportation telecommunications machinery manufacturing and computers and electronics companies will feel the greatest impact from the tariff hike according to moody s on saturday mr trump tweeted about tariffs such an easy way to avoid tariffs make or produce your goods and products in the good old usa it s very simple he wrote

executive officer of assured guaranty ltd and rob bailenson our chief financial officer after their remarks we ll open the call to your questions operator instructions i will now turn the call over to dominic dominic frederico president and chief executive officer thank you robert and welcome to everyone joining today s call in the first quarter of 2019 assured guaranty once again established new per share highs for shareholder equity operating shareholder equity and adjusted book value we continue to be the leading municipal bond insurance company and made further progress in building the markets for our financial guarantees in the international infrastructure and structured finance markets in terms of new business production our diversified underwriting strategy once again proved its value during the quarter each of our financial guaranty businesses u s public finance international infrastructure finance and global structured finance made a meaningful contribution for u s public finance municipal bond yields declined throughout the first quarter of 2019 and fell more rapidly after the fed announced an indefinite halt to interest rate increases lower yields limit demand for our guarantee as some investors forgo the extra security in favor of achieving more yield the yield decline was most pronounced at the long end of the curve where the negative effects of our premiums is greatest because they are calculated as a percentage of total debt serviced over the life of each transaction some of the yield pressures due to the strongest net quarterly inflows to the municipal bond mutual fund since that data was first collected in 1992 possibly because people preparing their federal tax returns were realizing that taxes at municipal bonds are one of the few remaining tax strategies after assuming the tax deductions were eliminated or capped by the 2017 tax law changes also during the quarter our credit spreads narrowed particularly in the a bbb categories where we insured the majority of our transactions the spread between a and aaa 30 year munis ended the quarter at 43 basis points the tightest level in 11 years under these conditions insured primary market penetration for the industry was approximately 5 of par volume and 16 of the deal count however as in recent quarters more than half of the a rated transactions utilized bond insurance in spite of the market pressures brought by low interest rates and tight spreads in terms of the overall municipal par issued in the first quarter the 22 year over year growth was deceptively large because volume in the first quarter of 2018 was suppressed by arrest issue bonds during the uncertainty about a pending tax reform that prevailed near the end of 2017 using the first quarter of 2017 as more a typical reference point first quarter volume in 2019 would be down 13 on that basis during the quarter assured guaranty led the municipal bond insurance primary market with 56 shares of both insured par issue and insured transactions sold additionally our secondary market business performed well with secondary market par insured increasing 74 compared with last year s first quarter results in total we insured 2 4 billion of u s public finance par our primary market business includes the largest insured green bond transaction to date where we insured almost 180 million of new york mtas transportation revenue green bonds which were issued with third party climate bond certification we look forward to adding value to more certified green bonds which is a way we can help municipalities lower the cost of reaching their environmental impact goals we also closed another significant healthcare transaction guaranteeing 81 million of taxable massachusetts development finance authority bonds for tufts university medical center for the wellforce health system in the international infrastructure finance we have now recorded new business premiums in 14 consecutive quarters which attest to the expanding understanding of and interest in our guarantees on the part of both investors and issuers outside the united states on march 31 we announced an innovative gbp135 million debt service reserve guarantee for the law schroeder group guarantee replaced existing bank facilities which was the first of its kind for a large u k water and sewerage company we believe this product will be attractive to similar companies who could benefit from a long term alternative to bank liquidity facilities that are subject to annual renewal brexit remains a wild card but not one we expect to have a major impact on our future opportunities we have strategies in place to deal with a number of brexit scenarios including a hard brexit and we are in various stages of executing these plans as events unfold our global structured finance business produced solid first quarter results generating 6 6 million of present value new business production or pvp transactions we insured included a large collateralized loan obligation and secondary market wraps to hold business securitizations we also insured an aircraft residual value insurance transaction we see additional opportunities in these sectors this year as well as in the life insurance sector since the beginning of the year we have seen several developments in puerto rico reassuringly general fund revenue result for the 9 months ended march 31 were 8 above the revised projections in the most recent certified fiscal plan from october 2018 to add some perspective the commonwealth previously disclosed that for the 8 months ended february 28 revenues were up more than 5 against the october revised projection and almost 33 against the original projection in june 2018 s fiscal plan additionally the government announced that a number of private sector jobs now exceeds the level before hurricane maria and according to the puerto rico economic development bank the unemployment rate declined from 10 to 8 8 between march of 2018 and march of 2019 a 12 annual decrease in early may we joined an amended restructuring support agreement with the puerto rico electric power authority along with a group of uninsured prepa bondholders the commonwealth and the oversight board we believe the settlement outlined in the new rsa can be the foundation for an effective consensual plan of adjustment that assures reliable electrical power for the people of puerto rico and we are committed to continuing to work cooperatively with prepa and the other stakeholders along the path to plan confirmation there is an important distinction between assured guaranty and other creditors in the restructuring process we have the ability to add value to the securitization exchange bonds we receive by potentially attaching our guarantee to them when we insured these bonds we believe this could materially improve assured guaranty s overall recovery onto the transaction as well as generate new insurance premiums for that reason our economic results could differ from those reflected in the rsa additionally by ensuring the replacement bonds our economic interest would continue to remain in line with that of the debtor over the long term and we would both benefit from the debtor s improved fiscal solvency and long term economic success there is more work to be done to achieve the plan of adjustment based on the prepa rsa and other credits still need to be addressed we believe strongly in our collateral and legal rights across all of our puerto rico exposures and we ll vigorously enforce these rights if consensual deals are not reached in another matter puerto rico s oversight board is appealing the first circuit s decision following the promesa s procedure for reporting board members is unconstitutional it s impossible to know whether the high court will agree to take the case meanwhile there is the possibility that the president will appoint and the senate will confirm all or some of the existing members we believe senate hearings will be good place to air the differences between congress intent in passing promesa and the actual performance of the board whose actions have frequently worked against the law s expressed goals of respecting constitutional priorities and contractual liens one of the oversight board s most troubling actions is an attempt to have some of the commonwealth yield bonds declared invalid and to call back previously distributed principal and interest from bondholders on the grounds that those bonds were issued in violation of the constitutional debt limit some might argue that we should accept the invalidation because our exposure to the bonds in question is much smaller than our exposure to the unchallenged go bonds and it could increase the likelihood of a full recovery on the rest of the gos and perhaps better recovery on some of our other exposures that view is not only bad business but also an atrocious disregard for the rule of law our position is that all of the general obligation bonds should be provided a 100 recovery because of the constitutional requirements they must be paid before all other government expenses and there is more than adequate funds to service the debt furthermore considering the representations and disclosures the commonwealth presented when it issued the challenge bonds and considering that early acceptance has been to proceeds we consider any challenge much less invalidation of those go bonds illegal and immoral it is very dangerous to allow municipality to borrow money with all the disclosures and legal support required to the time of issuance and then turn around and say sorry we lied and because we lied we won t pay your debt service there are multiple supreme court cases going back to the 19th century that says you can t do that and for obviously good reasons the point is surely known by the highly compensated lawyers and consultants in which the commonwealth is showering hundreds of millions of dollars of local taxpayer money so their position is merely a negotiating ploy that among other things is intended to drive down the market value of the bonds in order to try to justify less than a 100 recovery the commonwealth and oversight board are also trying to persuade the courts to reverse the historical treatment in bankruptcy of special revenue bonds the authors of the relevant bankruptcy provisions enacted in 1988 and the entire municipal bond market understood that it is mandatory not optional for special revenue payments to continue uninterrupted throughout bankruptcy yet the title iii court and the first circuit court have ruled otherwise with serious potential consequences for the stability of the special revenue bond market the contingent effect of the unwillingness of the commonwealth and oversight board to repay puerto rico s debt is already becoming evident rating agencies are reexamining and in some cases changing revenue bond ratings based on the increased uncertainty about the security arrangements for special revenue bonds and more generally the market must now reevaluate what full faith and credit really means and reconsider how much yield is required to compensate for political risk the possibility that officials will be unwilling to pay the general obligation commitments made by their predecessors assured guaranty is prepared to take every case as far as necessary to preserve the security arrangements and laws that underpin the municipal bond market and specifically our legal rights under our insurance policies all the rating agencies that follow us have published opinions that our puerto rico exposures are manageable including moody s about 2 weeks ago and we have few if any other credits in our insured portfolio that are truly problematic our claims paying resources remain near 12 billion even as our net par exposure has declined 63 since 2009 we are in very strong financial position and we ll continue to provide financial protection to our insureds looking at our pipeline of probable business and our other strategic objectives we feel confident that 2019 will be a rewarding year we estimate that the trend in our declining par exposure will reverse in the near term as we re being in insuring businesses of higher rates than our insured exposure amortizes we have and we ll still have significant excess capital that we will continue to manage through share buybacks and dividends and we continue to look for appropriate alternative investments to diversify our corporate profile i will now turn the call over to rob robert tucker senior managing director head of investor relations and communications thank you dominic and good morning to everyone on the call the company s results were strong in the first quarter of 2019 as we once again reached record high operating shareholders equity and adjusted book value per share of 62 and 86 95 respectively these milestones demonstrate the ongoing value created for our shareholders through various strategic initiatives dominic just reviewed our new business production and the progress we have made on resolving our puerto rico exposure and i will cover our share repurchase program later on but first i will review the first quarter 2019 operating results in the first quarter operating income was 86 million or 0 82 per share compared with the 155 million or 1 33 per share in the first quarter of 2018 lower net earned premiums from refundings and higher loss adjustment expenses were the primary drivers of the variance net earned premiums were 118 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared with the 145 million in the first quarter of 2018 as expected after the passage of the 2017 tax act and consistent with the amortization of our insured portfolios subject to call accelerations due to refundings and terminations declined to 26 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared with 52 million in the first quarter of 2018 first quarter 2019 loss and loss adjustment expenses are higher than first quarter 2018 mainly due to higher u s public finance losses offset by lower losses in our rmbs as we have said in the past loss and loss adjustment expenses reported income in any given period differs from economic loss development due to technical difficulty operator senior managing director head of investor relations and communications pardon me it seems like the speaker has went silent robert bailenson cfo cao so it seems like we had some our mics cut out so i m going to repeat the last paragraph first quarter 2019 loss and loss adjustments expenses were higher than the first quarter of 2018 mainly due to higher u s public finance losses offset by lower losses in rmbs as we have said in the past loss and loss adjustment expenses reported income in any given period differs from economic loss development due to the consideration of unearned premium reserve in the calculation of loss and loss adjustment expenses under gaap accounting rules total economic loss development was a benefit of 2 million in the first quarter of 2019 which primarily consisted of a 65 million benefit in u s rmbs offset by increased loss and loss adjustment expenses for certain puerto rico exposures the benefit in rmbs was mainly related to a general increase in excess spread and the improved performance of second lien transactions the economic development attributable to changes in discount rates was a benefit of 4 million in the first quarter of 2019 in terms of strategic initiatives we have continued to repurchase shares in order to efficiently manage our capital position during the first quarter of 2019 we repurchased 1 9 million shares for 79 million at an average price of 41 62 per share since the beginning of 2013 and through the end of the first quarter we have repurchased a total of 96 5 million shares the cumulative effect of these repurchases was a benefit of approximately 15 84 per share in operating shareholders equity and approximately 27 83 in adjusted book value per share since the end of the quarter we have repurchased an additional 853 000 shares at an average price of 46 25 for a total of 40 million bringing the current year to date share repurchases to 119 million or 2 8 million shares cumulative repurchase since 2013 represent about half of the shares that were outstanding at the start of the program as of today our remaining share repurchase authorization is approximately 279 million we currently have approximately 260 million in cash and investments available for liquidity needs and capital management activities at the holding companies insurance regulators to approve the release of capital from our insurance subsidiaries in order to fund share repurchases for example as a first step we saw and in march we received approval for a 100 million dividend from mat to its also parent companies agm and agc this mat dividend will ultimately be recorded as statutory net investment income for agc and agm which is expected to increase the normal dividend paying capacity for agm by 61 million for 2019 and for agc by 39 million for 2020 i will now turn the call over to the operator to give you the instructions for the q a period thank you questions and answers operator operator instructions and our first question today comes from geoffrey dunn with dowling partners please go ahead geoffrey dunn dowling partners analyst yes good morning i guess first question can you give any additional color on the economic development with respect to puerto rico in the quarter was there any residual cofina in it was there any true up related to the prepa rsa or is it just general exposure development that we re seeing in the 61 million robert bailenson cfo cao as you know geoff we respond to all information after the quarter end and so in the case of the first circuit upholding judge swain s ruling on special revenues we reacted to that information because we expected that will then cause any court or any court validation to be taking a longer time and therefore because timing is going out further for recoveries as well as continuing to pay losses we adjusted our probabilities for any go or hda credit on the other side the rsa actually would benefit and we adjusted our probabilities with respect to prepa but net net we had an increase in reserves at economic loss development in puerto rico geoffrey dunn dowling partners analyst and no cofina in there that was done in q4 robert bailenson cfo cao no that was there was nothing for cofina geoffrey dunn dowling partners analyst ok great that s helpful thanks and then can you give any additional color whether it be a range or percentage or anything like that in terms of what the various fees and economic opportunity unwrapping the bonds might do in terms of reducing your loss obviously i don t think the par amortization or the amortization scheduled for the new bonds is out but on the surface you re looking at 20 plus type of hit on prepa you put the other stuff in there i think you said in your release it should be a lot lower economically but can you frame that up any better for us dominic frederico president and chief executive officer sure if you think about it the way that rsa is structured geoff is they re really providing by the surcharge a level of debt service so a fixed amount of payment into the new bond structure so if you can think about the new bonds being issued say at 5 25 on the a bonds and like 7 5 on the b bonds and the way it s structured in these surcharges to provide cash flow to service that debt so you will get given amount of par relative to that interest rate against the debt service payments that are being provided if you then go out and insure those bonds you lower the interest rate therefore you will increase the principal amount of the par that you will be received or will be able to be serviced through the fixed charge going through the surcharge on the electric bills so it s a pickup of par that would then further improve your recovery against the bonds that you re retiring and then two you get paid a premium relative to the insurance of the new bonds as well so if you think about a 50 basis point improvement in the interest rate what does that then do to a fixed stream of cash flow relative to the new par that debt service will be able to provide for that s how you think about the economics being improved geoffrey dunn dowling partners analyst i guess a pointed question do you think this could be a single digit relative write off for you i guess that s a no comment dominic frederico deputy chairman president ceo that s a no comment and remember as we look at this much like cofina we have the option so it s at our option and we re going to look at a what the government is at that time with other covenants or requirements we re going to be made through the operational kind of independence in the operational efficiency of the utility so we can always do uninsured or do an insured it s going to be our choice much like cofina where we still hold those bonds and we still have the option of insuring them to further improve the economics or not depending on how we feel about the government and it s behavior geoffrey dunn dowling partners analyst and then just a quick number question rob do you have a breakout of primary versus secondary for r and pvp robert bailenson cfo cao yes i knew you were going to ask that you are consistent geoffrey so primary we had 10 1 million pvp for 1 point about 1 678 billion of par and in secondary we had 21 5 million of pvp for 338 million of par geoffrey dunn dowling partners analyst thank you operator and our next question comes from allen weinstein ph with elliott investments ph unidentified participant gentlemen thank you for taking my question dominic i wanted to thank you again for your comments about go issuance post 2012 it s about time that someone stood up for the rights of municipal bond holders and i very much appreciate your comments about the validity and claw back attempt on go issuance so thank you for that my question has to do with getting over the hurdle with prepa and combining your interest with mbia currently mbia as you know trades at about 35 of adjusted book value have you given any consideration to partnering or making some kind of acquisition where you could control the outcome of prepa by controlling mbia s holdings dominic frederico deputy chairman president ceo well as you know our goal is to combine or consolidate the entire remaining financial guaranty industry which we ve done in a very accretive way to the ultimate book value and bottom line of the company as well as continue to improve the perception of our insurance policy by improving the rating on those specific bonds that we wind up acquiring through the acquisition of the company and therefore the insurance that they provide as you know we look at everybody all the time we continue to evaluate opportunities as we move along resolving more puerto rico s exposures which tend to be one of the bigger when you think of us in the acquisition world number one we have to look at is what is the capital structure of the target are there three mouse at the table two mouse is there just equity is there surplus notes is there preferred stock is there deferred payment obligations so it s really the complex kind of view of the equity side and then number two we reunderwrite every credit in the portfolio and charge what we determin to be reasonable relative to today s both market conditions and capital charges puerto rico tend to be one of the more contentious credits that you would look at in anybody s portfolio so as those get resolved it simplifies the underwriting side of our acquisition opportunity we still have to deal with the capital side so as we move along puerto rico and hopefully there will be more activity as we go through the year i think it does provide a greater opportunity for assured to continue its consolidation strategy more importantly as those companies start to reach kind of the final conclusion of whatever they re dealing with in their capital structure and portfolios it then becomes a good opportunity for them to either reload their business purpose and in effect go on to their new direction or liquidate the company and basically pay out their shareholders so we think puerto rico in a lot of ways is a good accelerant to further opportunities relative to our consolidation goals unidentified participant thank you thank you i appreciate that operator and our next question comes from bose george with kbw bose george kbw analyst yes good morning yes just one more on the prepa rsa do you think there s a road map to get from the current level to the 67 that s needed if mbia does not join in dominic frederico deputy chairman president ceo well you need 67 and that s currently written in the rsa agreement it doesn t mean you have to stay there so that s number one number two they have voting rights to anywhere between 13 and 17 the number continues to move so you think about that still leaves 83 out there or 87 depending on your perspective and you need 67 and we ve got i think something around 50 now so your guess is as good as mine but i m sure the government will go back and do whatever s necessary to try to enforce this both to get over the necessary threshold or they ll change the threshold one of the two remember in the title vi it s a different voting requirement than in the title iii so that s one thing you have to keep in mind before the plan adjustment requires a different voting calculation than the title vi does bose george kbw analyst so under title iii it could end up being just a lower number that s required to get it over dominic frederico deputy chairman president ceo remember title iii has to have a qualifying quorum to vote and then you need a majority of that qualifying quorum right so it s a different threshold i think at 67 you need the quorum for vote and then majority of the vote of the 67 or whatever that number is that s above the 67 that s title iii title vi on the voluntary restructuring it s what they implied or what they provided for in the rsa that doesn t mean that can t be changed bose george kbw analyst okay great that s helpful and then actually just going back to geoff s question just on the potential quantifying the benefit can you just repeat your answer the 50 basis points at the time so we look at that dominic frederico deputy chairman president ceo well you guys are the quants right so you can figure out what the if you have a given fixed amount of debt service and you lower the interest rate take a number 50 basis points 75 basis points how much additional par can be serviced by that level payment of debts there bose george kbw analyst okay so look at the duration and present value that look at the benefit that way dominic frederico deputy chairman president ceo right and then you ll figure out what the enhancement to par insured over the par value of the bonds against the original 67 and 0 10 on the b bonds and therefore you can calculate what the ultimate recovery is robert bailenson cfo cao as well as the premium that s going to be charged in the transaction bose george kbw analyst ok that s great on top of that yes thank you dominic frederico deputy chairman president ceo you re welcome operator ladies and gentlemen this will conclude the call i d like to turn the conference back over to robert tucker for any closing remarks robert tucker senior managing director head of investor relations and communications thank you operator and thank you all for joining us on today s call i d like to thank you for that if you have additional questions please feel free to give us a call thank you very

trump s tariffs on china what are they how do they work chinatopix ap washington president donald trump has heightened tensions with china by escalating his tariffs on 200 billion in chinese goods from 10 to 25 as a tool of national policy tariffs had long been fading into history a relic of the 19th and early 20th centuries that most experts came to see as harmful to all nations involved yet more than any other modern president trump has embraced tariffs as a punitive tool against europe canada and other key trading partners but especially against china the second largest economy after the u s the trump administration asserts and many independent analysts agree that beijing has deployed predatory tactics to try to give chinese companies an edge in such advanced technologies as artificial intelligence robotics and electric vehicles beijing s tactics the u s contends include hacking into u s companies computers to steal trade secrets forcing foreign companies to turn over sensitive technology in exchange for access to china s markets and unfairly subsidizing chinese companies trump has also complained angrily about america s gaping trade deficit with china for which he blames weak and naive negotiating by previous u s administrations last july trump began gradually imposing tariffs on chinese imports after friday s increase the administration is now imposing 25 tariffs on 250 billion in chinese goods beijing has counterpunched by taxing 110 billion of american products focusing on agricultural goods notably soybeans in a calculated effort to inflict pain on trump supporters in the farm belt here s a look at what tariffs are and how they work what exactly are tariffs tariffs are a tax on imports they are typically charged as a percentage of the transaction price that a buyer pays a foreign seller to use a simplistic example ignoring real world minimum amounts subject to tariffs say an american retailer buys 100 garden umbrellas from china for 5 apiece 500 total and suppose the u s tariff rate for the umbrellas is 6 5 percent the retailer would have to pay a 32 50 tariff on the shipment thereby raising the total price from 500 to 532 50 in the united states tariffs sometimes also called duties or levies are collected by customs and border protection agents at 328 ports of entry across the country proceeds go to the treasury the tariff rates are published by the u s international trade commission in the harmonized tariff schedule which lists u s tariffs on everything from dried plantains 1 4 percent to parachutes 3 percent sometimes the u s will impose additional tariffs on imports that it determines are being sold at unfairly low prices or are being supported by foreign government subsidies what are tariffs supposed to achieve two things increase government revenue and protect domestic industries from foreign competition before the federal income tax was established in 1913 tariffs were a big money raiser for washington from 1790 to 1860 tariffs produced 90 percent of federal revenue according to douglas irwin an economist at dartmouth college by contrast tariffs in recent years have accounted for only about 1 percent of federal revenue tariffs are meant to raise the price of imports or punish foreign countries for unfair trade practices like subsidizing their exporters and dumping their goods at unfairly low prices they discourage imports by making them costlier they also reduce pressure from foreign competition and make it easier for home grown companies to raise prices as global trade grew after world war ii tariffs fell out of favor the formation of the world trade organization and the forging of trade deals like the north american free trade agreement reduced or eliminated tariffs the average u s tariff is now one of the lowest in the world 1 6 percent the same as the european union s the pew research center reports are tariffs a wise policy most economists say no tariffs raise the cost of imports for people and companies that need to buy them and by reducing competitive pressure they give u s producers leeway to raise prices too that s good for those producers but bad for almost everyone else rising costs especially hurt consumers and companies that rely on imported parts some u s companies that buy steel for example complain that trump s tariffs on imported steel leave them at a competitive disadvantage their foreign rivals can buy steel more cheaply and offer lower priced goods in 2002 president george w bush s administration placed tariffs on imported steel a study financed by steel consuming businesses found that the tariffs cost 200 000 american jobs that year more broadly trade restrictions make an economy less efficient with lesser competition from abroad domestic companies lose the incentive to increase efficiency or to focus on what they do best

michael landy michael landy president and chief executive officer thanks susan good morning everyone and thank you for joining us we are pleased to discuss our results for the second quarter ended march 31 following last quarter s record earnings our affo per share of 0 21 this quarter represents a 4 5 decrease over the prior year period and an 8 7 sequential decrease the sequential decrease in affo per share is attributable to a reduction in dividend income from our securities portfolio and the impact of our october equity offering combined with additional equity raised pursuant to our dividend reinvestment plan this year over year decrease in affo per share is attributable to the impact of our october equity offering combined with additional equity raised pursuant to our dividend reinvestment plan as well as a modest increase of vacancies in our portfolio we expect that the combination of our recently completed building expansion and our significantly increased acquisition pipeline will contribute positively to our earnings in the ensuing quarters advertisement advertisement from a portfolio standpoint during the first two quarters of fiscal 2019 we grew our gla by 628 000 square feet representing a 9 increase year over year this was achieved through the acquisition of six brand new class a properties at an aggregate cost of 285 8 million by the quarter end our portfolio comprised 113 properties with 21 8 million rentable square feet geographically diversified across 30 states our occupancy rate was 98 9 representing a reduction of 30 basis points from a year ago our weighted average lease maturity at quarter end increased to 8 years from 7 8 years in the prior year period representing a 3 increase effective march 1 we completed a 155 000 square foot building expansion for a total project cost of 8 6 million at one of our properties located in the cincinnati msa this building expansion resulted in an 821 000 increase in the annual rent of the property bringing the total annualized rent up to 2 1 million in addition the lease was extended to a 15 year term expiring on february 2034 we will get the full run rate benefit of this expansion in the next quarter and beyond as mentioned our acquisition pipeline grew substantially during the quarter to 245 9 million effectively doubling our pipeline as reported in the first quarter we now have five built to suit development projects representing 1 9 million square feet with a weighted average lease term of 13 7 years either currently or soon to be under construction keeping with our business model all of these projects are subject to long term leases to investment grade tenants of these five properties two comprising 772 000 square feet are leased for 15 years to fedex ground and one comprising 613 000 square feet is leased for 15 years to amazon the remaining two properties consisting of 503 000 square feet are leased to toyota and magna automotive advertisement advertisement from a timing standpoint we expect to close on two of these acquisitions for approximately 107 million representing 963 000 square feet or approximately 50 of our current pipeline during this fiscal year the remaining three built to suit projects representing 138 9 million containing approximately 925 000 are expected to close in fiscal 2020 to take advantage of today s attractive interest rate environment we have already locked in very favorable financing for two of these acquisitions the combined financing terms for these two acquisitions consist of 69 5 million and proceeds representing 65 of the total cost these financings have a weighted average interest rate of 4 27 one mortgage is a 15 year self amortizing loan and the other is an 18 year self amortizing loan representing a weighted average term of 17 3 years these built to suit acquisitions are all well located state of the art industrial assets and will represent excellent additions to our high quality portfolio as always these future acquisitions are subject to satisfactory due diligence and we anticipate closing these transactions upon completion and occupancy turning to the overall u s industrial market outlook following last year s strong performance 2019 is off to a good start with approximately 26 million square feet of positive net absorption during the first quarter this extends the record streak of positive net absorption to 36 consecutive quarters or 9 straight years as per cushman and wakefield s first quarter industrial market report the national average vacancy rate remains near record lows at 4 9 currently representing a 10 basis point improvement from the prior year this increased demand is driving rents higher to an average asking rent of 6 41 per square foot representing a 4 increase over the prior year period currently there is approximately 309 million square feet of new industrial construction taking place in the u s representing a 24 increase over the prior year period similarly with last year approximately two thirds of this new supply is speculative development despite weakness abroad the u s economy continues to show considerable strength with the april unemployment rate of 3 6 marking the strongest level in 50 years advertisement advertisement first quarter real gdp weighed in at an annualized rate of 3 2 driven primarily by increased exports and inventory investment following 2 2 real gdp growth in the prior quarter as you are likely well aware demand for industrial space is highly correlated with gdp growth and the healthy first quarter number is a positive indicator for a continuation of what is now the strongest industrial property expansion ever recorded now let me turn it over to rich so we can provide you with more detail on the property level as well as our progress on the leasing front richard p molke vice president of asset management thank you mike with respect to our property portfolio our occupancy stood at 98 9 at quarter end representing a 30 basis point decrease from a year ago and unchanged sequentially advertisement advertisement as mentioned our weighted average lease maturity increased from 7 8 years a year ago to 8 0 years as of quarter end our weighted average rent per square foot increased by 5 4 to 6 23 as of quarter end as compared to 5 91 a year ago our weighted average rent is 3 below the national average asking rent of 6 41 per square foot representing good embedded rent growth potential from a leasing standpoint in fiscal 2019 twelve leases representing approximately 1 5 million square feet or 7 of our gross leasable area were scheduled to expire eight of the twelve expiring leases representing 1 2 million square feet or 80 of the expiring gla have since been either renewed or released resulting in a weighted average lease term of 7 2 years and a 2 4 increase in rental rates on a gaap basis and a 5 7 decrease on a cash basis seven of these eight leases representing approximately 1 1 million square feet were lease renewals the four remaining leases coming due this year did not renew as previously reported one of the four leases that did not renew was our currently vacant 92 000 square foot facility located in charleston south carolina which was leased to fedex ground fedex did not renew in this facility because it was replaced by our newly constructed 265 000 square foot facility nearby the new 265 000 square foot facility is leased to fedex ground for 15 years through june of 2033 in addition our 105 000 square foot facility located in buffalo new york leased to fedex ground through august will not be renewing because it has been replaced by our recently constructed 339 000 square foot facility the recently constructed 339 000 square foot facility is leased to fedex ground for 15 years through march 2031 the remaining two leases include our small 60 000 square foot facility located in richmond virginia previously leased by united technologies and a small retail tenant that was leasing 2 000 square feet in our retail shopping center located in somerset new jersey our only additional vacancy is an 81 000 square foot facility in the pittsburgh msa which became vacant in fiscal 2018 these five properties totaling 339 000 square feet and representing 1 6 of our total gross leasable area are currently being actively marketed and we expect to have more to share with you in the ensuing quarters and now kevin will provide you with greater detail on our financial results advertisement advertisement kevin s miller chief financial officer thank you rich core funds from operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 were 19 6 million or 0 21 per diluted share this compares the core ffo for the the same period one year ago of 16 8 million or 0 22 per diluted share representing a 4 5 decrease from the previous year adjusted funds from operations or affo were 19 2 million or 0 21 per diluted share for the recent quarter as compared to 16 8 million dollars or 0 22 per diluted share a year ago also representing a 4 5 decrease from the prior year period these decreases were attributable to the impact of our 9 2 million share offering this past october and the issuance of 1 5 million shares pursuant to our dividend reinvestment plan as well as an increase in vacancies in our portfolio given our substantial 245 9 million acquisition pipeline we expect to meaningfully grow our per share earnings going forward rental and reimbursement revenue for the quarter were 39 3 million compared to 34 3 million representing an increase of 14 from the previous year net operating income was 32 5 million for the quarter reflecting a 15 increase from the comparable period a year ago this increase was due to the additional income related to the six industrial properties purchased since the prior year period net income attributable to common shareholders was 23 8 million for the second quarter as compared to 7 4 million in the previous year s second quarter representing a 222 increase advertisement advertisement this large increase in our net income attributable to common shareholders was due to the accounting rule change in which unrealized gains and losses on our securities investments are now reflected on our income statement prior to the adoption of this accounting rule change unrealized gains and losses reflected as a change in shareholders equity as we mentioned during our prior quarters call this will at times result in large swings both up and down in our net income attributable to common shareholders the 222 increase in net income attributable to common shareholders this quarter was primarily driven by the 15 6 million decrease in the unrealized loss on our securities portfolio excluding the effect of this accounting rule change net income attributable to common shareholders would have been 8 3 million representing an 11 6 increase from the prior year quarter we will continue to report our core ffo and affo results exactly as we always have as these metrics back out these non recurring non cash fluctuations and a more indicative of our recurring performance with regards to our same property metrics for the current three month period our same property noi decreased 1 4 on a gaap basis and 0 8 on a cash basis these slight decreases in same property noi were mostly due to a 90 basis point decrease in same property occupancy to 98 7 one of the many favorable attributes of having a high quality industrial portfolio leased to investment grade tenants is we receive a lot of property expansion requests during the past five years we have completed 18 property expansions at an aggregate cost of 70 3 million these expansions resulted in lease extensions ranging from 10 to 15 years and economic returns averaging 10 on levered however because we remove building expansions from our same property portfolio our same property results understate our overall portfolio performance advertisement advertisement as of the quarter end our capital structure consisted of approximately 884 million in debt of which 754 million was property level fixed rate mortgage debt and 130 million were loans payable 85 of our total debt is fixed rate with the weighted average interest rate of 4 1 we also had 299 million in perpetual preferred equity a quarter end our total debt plus preferred equity combined with an equity market capitalization of 1 2 billion results in total market capitalization of approximately 2 4 billion at quarter end from a credit standpoint we continue to be conservatively capitalized with our net debt to total market capitalization at 35 8 our net debt plus preferred equity to total market capitalization at 48 2 our fixed charge coverage at 2 4x and our net debt to adjusted ebitda at 6 4x from a liquidity standpoint we ended the quarter with 16 4 million in cash and cash equivalents we also had 90 million available from our credit facility as well as an additional 100 million potentially available from the accordion feature in addition we held 177 4 million in marketable reit securities at quarter end representing 8 5 of our total unappreciated assets and now let me turn it back to michael before we open up the call for questions michael landy president and chief executive officer thanks kevin in summary given strong industrial sector fundamentals we continue to be very optimistic about the prospects of our property portfolio and the potential for future earnings growth associated with the continuing successful execution of our large acquisition pipeline we d now be happy to take your questions operator president and chief executive officer we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions the first question today comes from frank lee with bmo please go ahead frank lee president and chief executive officer hi guys it s good to see you guys completed the building expansion in ohio this quarter and you re able to get some additional rent and term can we see any additional expansion type projects potentially start this year michael landy president and chief executive officer yes we have about 5 2 to 1 land to building average so our 113 properties have ample land for expansion i think kevin mentioned in the prepared remarks that looking backwards we ve done 70 million in expansions over the last five years that s 18 building expansions we have nothing to report on this call i ll turn it over to rich maybe he could add some more color but expenses are a real benefit to our portfolio it s been an ongoing source of taking a lease maturity that s currently 8 5 years going out and extending it even further because we get these expansions so when you have a cash flow such as ours secured by investment grade tenants you re going to get your weighted average lease term it s not going to fall short and because of the additional land you re going to actually do better than that rich anything brewing on an expansion front you want to share at this time richard p molke vice president of asset management no we re always talking but nothing definitive frank lee vice president of asset management okay thanks and then also now with the securities book 8 5 on depreciated assets and it s getting closer to your 10 self imposed cap like what are you thoughts and where the securities book stands today michael landy president and chief executive officer our thoughts are as follows we re really pleased with our pipeline we have about a quarter billion pipeline all brand new build to suits set to come online roughly 50 in fiscal 2019 and the other 50 looking like the second half of fiscal 2020 so given we have that runway of allocating capital to our core business we would like to take to the portfolio lower we will be reallocating capital from the securities portfolio into closing those deals and so i see it going lower and once we get it lower i d like to keep it lower we have a portfolio of roughly 180 million and given the gains in some holdings and the losses in others we could access about 100 million at cost right now in capital without taking any realized gains or realized losses so we ll watch the portfolio closely the markets have been volatile and there s a lot of things overhanging the broad market but our core business is single tenant net lease industrial s on long term leases to investment grade tenants we now have a quarter billion pipeline in front of us so we can allocate the portfolio into that and take it down closer to 5 of gross assets frank lee president and chief executive officer okay thank you operator president and chief executive officer the next question comes from rob stevenson with janney please go ahead rob stevenson analyst thanks good morning guys when you were talking earlier about the vacant assets being marketed is that being marketed for sale or marketed for lease richard p molke vice president of asset management they re always marketed for both but going into the spring quarter we ve had a lot of activity on the leasing front so we feel really good about filling some vacancies in the near term and having occupancy trend higher michael landy president and chief executive officer just to share our philosophy on that rob if i could jump in thanks rich if i could just jump in ideally we re a small company with over 113 properties with rounding up 22 million square feet we want to keep all our assets we get unsolicited calls to buy properties from us so a lot of demand it s a seller s market but we re looking to grow so ideally the five vacant properties we have we fill them with tenants but we cast this wider net as possible and if we re going to market it you might as well market it for seller lease and take the best deal at hand rob stevenson analyst okay and then in terms of the four non renewals this year one of them vacated in the first quarter am i correct michael landy president and chief executive officer that s correct rob stevenson analyst and then fedex is august and then the richmond in the retail and the small retail tenant when do those leases expire michael landy president and chief executive officer they ve all expired except the fedex in the buffalo market rob stevenson analyst okay and how significant is the quarterly or annual rent on that asset for modeling purposes michael landy president and chief executive officer for modeling purposes the cheektowaga fedex they moved out of another newer building of ours but the rents above market is rich correct me if i m wrong it s about 2 above market richard p molke vice president of asset management right around there michael landy president and chief executive officer yes so it s we ll take a roll down but we have good interest and hopefully we ll get a strong investment grade credit in there rob stevenson analyst okay and then last one for me kevin did you guys i mean the securities portfolio increased during the quarter was that all just increases in reit stock prices or did you guys buy anything during the quarter michael landy president and chief executive officer it s a combination of both it s about 15 million increase in unrealized and about 16 million of purchases rob stevenson analyst any new positions in there michael landy president and chief executive officer no rob stevenson analyst okay so the 16 million that was deployed within two existing positions michael landy president and chief executive officer that s correct operator president and chief executive officer the next question comes from michael carroll with rbc capital markets please go ahead michael carroll analyst thanks mike can you talk a little bit about i guess you said that you want to get the securities book down to 5 of gross assets what s the timing on that i mean is it going to be more of a match funding when you close on your core pipeline then you ll still down the securities portfolio are you have you already started doing that michael landy president and chief executive officer no it s the former like you said we have a runway in front of us with a 0 25 billion in five acquisitions half scheduled to close this fiscal year the second half scheduled to close in the latter part of 2020 and so that s the timeline i envision relatively taking the portfolio down michael carroll analyst and is 5 kind of a new target i mean once you kind of get to that level are you going to stay there or how are you thinking about that michael landy president and chief executive officer yes i think we want to kind of watch and see how things go the best part about having a securities portfolio is the flexibility it brings to the balance sheet it served us well for so long since the late 90s we ve had the portfolio looking at cumulative returns it has generated over 50 million in dividend income and realized gains of over 30 million so it s been a great and that s just since 2010 so it s been a good adjunct to our balance sheet but we ve gotten to the size as a pure play industrial lead where it s creating a distraction somewhat and so the negative aspects are perhaps outweighing the positive aspects but when we take it down to five we ll revisit how it s performing michael carroll analyst okay and then how do you think about reallocating that portfolio i mean do you do that on a quarterly basis i know some of the holdings there s been some negative news regarding their dividends i mean how do you look about that michael landy president and chief executive officer well we re long term investors we look through what the short term issues are a lot of our portfolio is tilted toward the retail sector we were really early in embracing industrial benefiting from consumer spending migrating from traditional brick and mortar to e commerce and the next chapter in our opinion is going to be more of a symbiotic relationship between the retailers and the brick and mortar stores and based on my store closures there s been about 6000 store openings in 2019 so we re taking a long term view and we didn t expect things to turn around on a quarterly basis and yet some of our retail holdings are already strongly profitable and some are strongly weak so we ll just have to keep watching but i think the main thing to understand is the company at a smaller size needed to have the securities portfolio is a great adjunct and to some extent we re outgrowing it michael carroll analyst okay and then can you talk a little bit of your fedex portfolio today i mean after the expected move outs or the fedex moving out to more modern facilities how many of the facilities that you currently lease would you consider modern facilities that fedex wants to be at versus the smaller facilities that they re looking to move out of into some of these more bigger properties michael landy president and chief executive officer yes so our weighted average building age overall looking at the fedex bucket and the non fedex bucket is about 8 5 years and then looking at the fedex bucket it s even more youthful so most of the portfolio has migrated to large state of the art highly automated processing over 15 000 packages per hour where fedex has made substantial investments in these buildings so i don t see that trend where they re moving out of the older building in certain markets and we re retaining them in the market but retaining them by providing bigger and better space i think we ve made most of that shift already and you re not going to see a significant amount of that going forward operator president and chief executive officer the next question comes from michael mueller with jp morgan please go ahead michael mueller analyst a couple of questions here first of all can you give us some color on the 5 7 i think it was negative cash rent spread just was it one building is a broad base and just what s the background there michael landy president and chief executive officer yes it was largely one building united technologies in carrollton texas and the thinking there is again we take a long term view and these are single tenant net leased properties to investment grade tenants and by working with that tenant getting the lease down to market keeping them in the building for five years they are now making substantial investments in that facility they have long term aspirations to stay there so i think the market is very fixated on leasing spreads and that number jumps out when you look at it versus small peers who are in net lease and therefore they need big leasing spreads to cover increased taxes increased insurance increased opex we re net lease so we don t it s apples to oranges in comparing leasing spreads but our thought process on the one that really drove down the leasing spreads this year was to work with our tenant and live to fight another day with them and they re very happy about it and they re making substantial investments in the building as i said and we ll see what happens five years from now on that renewal rich anything you want to add richard p molke vice president of asset management now that s the philosophy and yeah we don t have any other significant cash decreases michael mueller analyst got it okay and then on the two fedex buildings where the leases didn t renew you said one was 2 above market in buffalo what about the other one and then i guess what s the context in the color in terms of why it s above market what happened in the marketplace where i guess market rents declined well that one s above market because we expanded it and in order to recoup the cost we expanded three times rich has pointing out so the rents just got above market to recoup the money in expanding the building we got all our costs back for making the building that much bigger and now we have to roll down to market anything else rich richard p molke vice president of asset management so charleston is right at market and has been expanded and the thing to remember with these two buildings is there s about 100 000 feet with 18 acres of land so they re highly configurable and going forward they can serve a lot of uses have expansion capabilities and we feel really good about them michael landy president and chief executive officer if i could just steal rich s thunder real quick so we have 98 9 occupied worst case scenario with the cheektowaga coming off lease will be 98 4 and there is good demand in all five vacant properties so our sense is occupancy is going to head higher going forward michael mueller analyst got it ok and last question for me i think you gave this on the inaudible i guess it s for you it would have been last quarter call heading into the first quarter here so heading into q3 what is the dividend income run rate for the quarter based on when you factor in i guess the cbl suspension and just kind of the other cut michael landy president and chief executive officer so factoring in everything that s been announced and everything that s occurred it s going to be similar to the run rate last quarter it s going to be about a 3 5 million run rate quarterly about a 14 million run rate annually and because it grew the portfolio grew a bit so we re on track for maintaining 3 5 million in quarterly dividends including everything that s been announced operator president and chief executive officer the next question comes from craig kucera with b riley fbr please go ahead craig kucera analyst good morning i may have missed this but what is the average initial yield on the acquisition pipeline as we stand today michael landy president and chief executive officer it s so competitive out there we used to get so granular and tell you everything that s happening on transaction by transaction and for competitive purposes i want to keep my cards closer to the vest going forward but i will say low 60 s is the average cap rate on our five property built to suit portfolio with a weighted average lease maturity of 13 7 years 245 9 million in acquisitions 1 9 million square feet okay jean should jump in at this point because i know it s hard for him to just be tight lipped and he probably wants to add so i ll it turn over eugene you get answer what you re going to say and catch up on anything else eugene w landy chairman executive director i just wanted to point out that cap rate is too important but spreads are important too and we re getting some of the lowest interest rates the longest terms the great percentages so that the business is very good business right now and we re doing more and more business with investment grade tenants the leases are longer some cases 15 years so between the financing and the cap rates it s a very profitable business craig kucera analyst okay great i guess with amazon s announcement to shift prime to one day shipping are you seeing any shift in the market yet as far as maybe where properties are being constructed or any acceleration in new development michael landy president and chief executive officer well i ll answer the question this way what e commerce is finding is that cumulative sales are going up exponentially but cumulative shipping costs are going up at an even greater rate so it s getting less and less profitable to answer that last mile part of the equation so they need to build they re going to keep going and keep growing and amazon s about half of the 500 billion in u s e commerce sales they re going to need more sortation centers they re going to need a lot of facilities to handle returns there s oversized goods that nobody envisioned people ordering to be delivered to their homes so therein lies what we believe to be the answer that traditional brick and mortar retail has to converge wit e commerce and be part of the equation in how these goods in a profitable manner get distributed but clearly amazon is investing heavily in engaging in building out their network but i will bring up that 80 of the fedex network is business to business only 20 is business to consumer 100 of amazon s distribution is business to consumer or consumer to consumers so they re serving two different purposes and for fedex is network amazon is about 1 of total sales operator president and chief executive officer the next question comes from merrill ross with boenning scattergood please go ahead merrill ross analyst thank you good morning historically as we see this year with the two move outs fedex moved when they wanted a larger facility despite the fact that you mentioned mike they ve put a ton of money into those properties so is that you suggest that each of the properties in your pipeline will have expansion capacity in order to kind of retain that tenant fee longer than the initial lease terms you mentioned 13 years with ability to grow alongside them that s one question and the second question is in relation to amazon in particular is it possible that ultimately the properties that you operate for own for them and lease to them would have a more flexible use in the future if they try to convert them to like warehouse pickup locations for those large items in particular that you mentioned michael landy president and chief executive officer yes all right so the first part of your question looking at our pipeline the land to building ratio of our pipeline is greater than our whole portfolio even though our portfolio is pretty ample land to building at 5 2 to 1 the pipeline is 7 to 1 so yes merrill absolutely when these strong fortune 100 companies take on a new build to suit property for a 15 year term they are baking into their equation 15 years from now how much bigger are they going to be and they re trying to factor in additional capacity because nobody wants to move it s very costly to move that s the last thing they want to do so the only time we lose tenants with a portfolio such as ours primarily it s because they ve outgrown the building and we can accommodate their growth so whenever there s land available contiguous to one of our properties we try to buy it because we don t want to lose these tenants for for lack of capacity as far as the uses the automation the state of the art of the robotics and the sortation equipment in the building keeps evolving and so that s another reason why they re doing additional lease term to amortize the tens of millions of dollars required to automate these facilities warrants and additional lease terms so if your question was upon move out are the buildings easily configurable for additional tenants i ll let rich answer that part richard p molke vice president of asset management yes these are as they come off you can just see the amounts of activity that we get and that s bodes well for the amount of uses that we can service going forward with these operator vice president of asset management the next question comes from barry oxford with d a davidson please go ahead barry oxford analyst great thanks mike just kind of building on that cash mark to market what do you see in the portfolio kind of going forward over the next few quarters that we might see from a cash mark to market out of portfolio michael landy president and chief executive officer i m not sure i understand the question are you telling about our property portfolio or you telling about securities portfolio barry oxford analyst no the property say when the leases roll over we had a kind of net negative 5 7 that mike alluded to but what do you see going forward on a mark to market basis on the leasing that you have rolling michael landy president and chief executive officer all right so i guess the one thing i always point to in answering that question is our company presentations are on our website and slide 25 shows all our lease maturities and how much is expiring on any given year as a percentage of gla and as a percentage of annual base rent and then looking at that we don t a lot of leases rolling in 20 and they re at an average rent rounding up of 5 50 a square foot i think in our prepared remarks you heard the weighted average asking rent in the u s right now is 6 41 so the prospects for cash roll ups that s a broad brush analysis looking at the whole nation but certainly there s good potential for embedded rent growth and then that slide goes on through 2034 and looking at all the ensuing years i don t see a year where we have substantial above market rents the high is 2026 the rents start hitting the 7 range but prior to that they re all substantially lower and who knows what rents are going to be in 2026 and our lease maturities go out to 2034 barry oxford analyst right got you okay thanks and then mike you want to close on about 107 million before your fiscal year end is that going to be more your fiscal 4q or 3q when we re trying to model that out or what s the difference michael landy president and chief executive officer yes i think that i d be conservative let s say fourth quarter barry oxford analyst okay and mike last question on a big picture question when we look at the china trade wars and the potential of this to slow port container traffic would you anticipate that to have an effect on the industrial market or not necessarily michael landy president and chief executive officer well i ll turn it over eugene first i definitely have some thoughts but go ahead eugene w landy chairman executive director we don t expect that the trade war is something everyone s worried about but at the end of the time both countries need each other very very badly we get merchandise at the lower cost china get valuable trade the dollars against reinvesting back in the united states i have always been an advocate of international trade nothing lifts the well being of the entire world population than trade and trade has grown exponentially for the four five decades i ve been in the business and there are billions and billions of people in india and china and the rest of the world we can see nothing but the increased need for facilities and infrastructure we need to modernize our ports we need to modernize our warehouse we need to modernize our roads and the volume of business we do today 40 years ago wasn t even dreamed of and we anticipate over the next 40 years the volume will be huge so we don t worry about the negotiations in washington today it s very short term and long term the prospects for transportation and distribution are excellent it creates wealth that the companies specialize in certain items and they produce extra items at the very lowest cost and so we trade back and forth and as the wealth of the world increases so monmouth feels very optimistic about the need for warehouse space and being part of this wonderful system michael landy president and chief executive officer well it s hard to answer that the only thing i ll add is our portfolio in america is tilted toward the locales that are business friendly and what eugene is saying is that trade will move to where it s less regulated and it s more hospitable for commerce to take place without any hindrances you saw what happened with a major company in new york and you re seeing that throughout the u s and its pro business states and if you look at our portfolio we purposely positioned our assets where things are more accommodating for free capitalism and goods to move and so whether the supply chain shifts to southeast asia or mexico it will still be a growing population a growing american economy operator president and chief executive officer this concludes our question and answer session i would now like to turn the conference back over to susan jordan for any closing remarks susan jordan vice president of investor relations thank you operator i d like to thank everyone for joining us on this call and for their continued support and interest in monmouth as always we re available for any follow up question we will be presenting at nari ph 3 week conference next month in new york and we hope to see some of you

many of president donald trump supporters know that he has heightened tensions with china by escalating his tariffs on 200 billion in chinese goods from 10 to 25 but they don t really know what that means as some of felt the hit in their income many haven t but as it continues they will begin noticing rising prices at walmart and target on everything from food to electronics as a tool of national policy tariffs had long been fading into history a relic of the 19th and early 20th centuries that most experts came to see as harmful to all nations involved yet more than any other modern president trump has embraced tariffs as a punitive tool against europe canada and other key trading partners but especially against china the second largest economy after the u s the trump administration asserts and many independent analysts agree that beijing has deployed predatory tactics to try to give chinese companies an edge in such advanced technologies as artificial intelligence robotics and electric vehicles beijing s tactics the u s contends include hacking into u s companies computers to steal trade secrets forcing foreign companies to turn over sensitive technology in exchange for access to china s markets and unfairly subsidizing chinese companies trump has also complained angrily about america s gaping trade deficit with china for which he blames weak and naive negotiating by previous u s administrations last july trump began gradually imposing tariffs on chinese imports after friday s increase the administration is now imposing 25 tariffs on 250 billion in chinese goods beijing has counterpunched by taxing 110 billion of american products focusing on agricultural goods notably soybeans in a calculated effort to inflict pain on trump supporters in the farm belt here s a close look at what tariffs are and how they work what exactly are tariffs tariffs are a tax on imports they are typically charged as a percentage of the transaction price that a buyer pays a foreign seller to use a simplistic example ignoring real world minimum amounts subject to tariffs say an american retailer buys 100 garden umbrellas from china for 5 apiece 500 total and suppose the u s tariff rate for the umbrellas is 6 5 percent the retailer would have to pay a 32 50 tariff on the shipment thereby raising the total price from 500 to 532 50 in the united states tariffs sometimes also called duties or levies are collected by customs and border protection agents at 328 ports of entry across the country proceeds go to the treasury the tariff rates are published by the u s international trade commission in the harmonized tariff schedule which lists u s tariffs on everything from dried plantains 1 4 percent to parachutes 3 percent sometimes the u s will impose additional tariffs on imports that it determines are being sold at unfairly low prices or are being supported by foreign government subsidies what are tariffs supposed to achieve two things increase government revenue and protect domestic industries from foreign competition before the federal income tax was established in 1913 tariffs were a big money raiser for washington from 1790 to 1860 tariffs produced 90 percent of federal revenue according to douglas irwin an economist at dartmouth college by contrast tariffs in recent years have accounted for only about 1 percent of federal revenue tariffs are meant to raise the price of imports or punish foreign countries for unfair trade practices like subsidizing their exporters and dumping their goods at unfairly low prices they discourage imports by making them costlier they also reduce pressure from foreign competition and make it easier for home grown companies to raise prices as global trade grew after world war ii tariffs fell out of favor the formation of the world trade organization and the forging of trade deals like the north american free trade agreement reduced or eliminated tariffs the average u s tariff is now one of the lowest in the world 1 6 percent the same as the european union s the pew research center reports are tariffs a smart policy most economists say no tariffs raise the cost of imports for people and companies that need to buy them and by reducing competitive pressure they give u s producers leeway to raise prices too that s good for those producers but bad for almost everyone else rising costs especially hurt consumers and companies that rely on imported parts some u s companies that buy steel for example complain that trump s tariffs on imported steel leave them at a competitive disadvantage their foreign rivals can buy steel more cheaply and offer lower priced goods in 2002 president george w bush s administration placed tariffs on imported steel a study financed by steel consuming businesses found that the tariffs cost 200 000 american jobs that year more broadly trade restrictions make an economy less efficient with lesser competition from abroad domestic companies lose the incentive to increase efficiency or to focus on what they do best
despite a december truce that kept the trade war between the world s two biggest economies from escalating the u s china standoff has shaken the world economy and caused companies to reconfigure their supply chains the international monetary fund warned that the global economy remains vulnerable to trade tensions and urged governments to adopt a policy of do no harm and that was before u s president donald trump ratcheted up u s tariffs on chinese goods ending the truce and potentially starting another cycle of retaliation 1 what s changed higher tariffs took effect one minute after midnight on may 10 new york time and china under president xi jinping vowed to retaliate with more countermeasures such as diverting its purchases away from the u s that could prompt trump to follow through on threats to slap duties on the remaining goods imported from china the risk of economic damage on both sides and possible political repercussions for trump in the 2020 election might make one or both sides reluctant to escalate 2 who pays these tariffs trump maintains the u s treasury is taking in 100 billion a year in tariffs on chinese imports according to an estimate by the congressional budget office it will be 74 billion in 2019 compared with 41 billion in 2018 trump also says the cost is mostly borne by china but that s misleading the u s importer of record a middleman is responsible for actually paying the tariff when a product lands onshore the importer might choose to bear the higher cost directly or to pass it along to a wholesaler who might pass it to a retailer who might raise the price charged to american consumers in those cases americans pay or the chinese producer may lower the original price to make up for the increased duty keeping the cost to the end buyer stable in some cases the chinese producer might shift production outside china to avoid the tariffs completely in the latter cases the economic repercussions would be felt in china story continues 3 where do negotiations stand differences remain on u s demands for structural change to the heavy involvement of the state in china s economy and for china to enshrine its concessions in law chinese officials are said to want the u s to remove its tariffs as a condition of any deal there have been some positive steps china agreed in principle to increase imports of u s agricultural products along with energy industrial products and services as part of a path to eliminate its imbalance in trade with the u s but the u s is said to be frustrated with what it considers to be china s backpedaling including on the crucial matter of forcing foreign companies to hand over technology china has denied it requires such transfers broader protection of intellectual property is a prime u s concern china in march passed a new foreign investment law it said would deal with some of those issues trump says he wants strong enforcement language to police any deal 4 why are we in a trade war trump points to the large u s trade deficit the difference between imports and exports as a symbol of a declining manufacturing base and the loss of american might he has said that any economic pain from tariffs or retaliatory duties imposed by other countries will be outweighed by the long term benefits from new trade deals in addition to goods from china he s imposed tariffs which act like a tax on imports on steel and aluminum from allies including canada mexico and the european union but the fight is also about who gets to set the rules for the global economy of the future the widening u s government crackdown on huawei technologies co a chinese telecommunications giant underscores a deepening strategic competition that will persist beyond the trade war 5 what s been the impact of the trade war investors and executives routinely say it s hurt business confidence and upended supply chains apple starbucks volkswagen and fedex are among companies that cited a slowing chinese economy in their outlooks more than 400 publicly traded chinese companies warned on their earnings the imf cutting its forecast for the world economy for the third time in six months due in part to trade tensions said in april that global growth would be 3 3 percent in 2019 which would be the weakest since 2009 meanwhile the u s trade deficit widened in 2018 to a 10 year high of 621 billion partly because the stronger dollar made u s exports pricier 6 how has the conflict been felt in the u s american shoppers have been mostly insulated because inflation remains tame and the tariffs haven t hit staples such as clothing footwear and toys a january report by bank of america corp analysts said any escalation of the trade war would be much more painful for the u s triggering renewed market volatility and undermining investor confidence trump is holding tight to his view that the trade war is helping the u s economy and he points to some recent evidence supporting that view a better than expected first reading of u s gross domestic product in the first quarter had the economy growing at an annual 3 2 percent in part because of a full percentage point boost from net exports and employment data showed the u s added 263 000 jobs in april 7 how has it been felt in china china s economic growth has been slowing in recent years a weakness that u s officials sought to leverage in their push for a trade agreement but china s economy rebounded through the first quarter of 2019 offering the government there more room for maneuver authorities in beijing have already promised almost 300 billion of tax cuts to stoke growth and are said to be considering other stimulus measures to bolster sales of cars and appliances bloomberg economics calculates tariffs at the current 10 percent add up to a 0 5 percentage point drag on china s growth this year an increase to 25 percent on 200 billion in chinese exports would raise the drag to 0 9 percentage point tariffs on all of

valener generated adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders of 37 3 million compared to 33 9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 a 3 4 million increase driven mainly by greater

from the second quarter of fiscal 2018 as for net income attributable to common shareholders it totalled 33 8 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 down 0 1 million year over year this decrease came from the arrangement related costs of 2 9 million incurred by valener as well as from a higher income tax expense which were almost entirely offset by an increase in the electric power generated by the seigneurie de beaupré winds farms sdb wind farms as a result of stronger wind conditions valener generated normalized operating cash flows of 14 4 million up 2 9 from the second quarter of fiscal 2018 mainly due to an increase in the distributions received from the sdb wind farms 3 seigneurie de beaupré wind farms during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 the sdb wind farms generated a combined 382 096 mwh of electricity a 28 6 increase owing to favourable second quarter wind conditions and given the fact that a period of frost had occurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 as a result the sdb wind farms generated 7 9 million in operating cash flows for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 a year over year decrease of 7 4 million or 48 4 resulting from an increase in an annual payment under a maintenance contract which called for an increase as of the fifth year of operation 3 seigneurie de beaupré wind farms 2 and 3 general partnership and seigneurie

share in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 québec energy distribution qda net income increased by 2 9 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2018 mainly due to a favourable regulatory timing difference vermont energy distribution net income grew 6 1 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2018 attributable to a favourable regulatory timing difference from green mountain power gmp combined with a favourable exchange rate impact the favourable impact of us 4 1 million for the first half of fiscal 2019 arising from the amortization of gmp s regulatory liabilities related to the u s tax reform will reverse by the end of fiscal 2019 and natural gas transportation net income increased by 1

activities have delivered good results and our first two quarters of fiscal 2019 have positioned us well for a solid financial year what s more the government of québec has confirmed that its energy ambitions are aligned with ours as it has enacted a new regulation on the minimum content of renewable natural gas that is to be distributed in québec over the next five years énergir continues to

quarter of fiscal 2019 net income attributable to the partners of énergir l p totalled 156 3 million compared to 154 4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 this increase was driven by the above mentioned factors and by a gain realized by gaz métro plus following the sale of its server hosting assets in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 quebec energy distribution qda generated adjusted net income of 119 5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 a 2 9 million year over year increase arising mainly from higher normalized natural gas deliveries given the maturation of new sales from residential and commercial customers and a favourable regulatory timing difference that should reverse by the end of fiscal 2019 4 adjusted net income attributable to partners november and december 2018 economic statements the economic statements prepared by the canadian government and quebec government in november and december 2018 translate into a tax decrease arising from changes to the tax depreciation applicable to certain assets since this tax decrease will eventually be returned to customers the fiscal 2019 net income attributable to partners is expected to decrease by approximately 6 6 million énergir l p expects this unfavourable impact to be almost entirely offset by the volume growth seen in h1 2019 multiyear regulation plan in december 2018 as part of phase i of its 2020 rate case qda submitted a proposal to the régie de l énergie régie that would ease the regulatory process by introducing multiyear treatments of certain rate setting parameters the proposal would serve as a transitional model to be in effect for the next three rate cases 2020 to 2022 that is until the rate structuring and customer segmentation files prerequisites to the implementation of an incentive mechanism are completed key aspects of the model include an indexing of operating expenses using a parametric formula a revision to the method for sharing overearnings and shortfalls and a renewal of the actual rate of return on deemed common equity in march 2019 the régie issued a decision wherein it renewed the 8 9 rate of return on deemed common equity for fiscal 2020 and approved the formula for indexing operating expenses for fiscal years 2020 to 2022 a decision on the sharing method and on the rate of return renewal for 2021 and 2022 is expected in autumn 2019 phase 2 in march and april 2019 qda filed phase 2 of its 2020 rate case with the régie the rate case presents among other parameters an overall average rate reduction of 14 4 across all services and an average rate base of 2 191 million up 34 0 million from the 2019 rate case the rate reduction stems mainly from a decrease in transportation and load balancing services given the favourable impact of the overearnings realized in past fiscal years and given the lower tcpl rates which have had a favourable impact on qda s customers since march 1 2019 the rate base increase is explained by the increase in investments in property plant and equipment the régie is expected to issue a decision in autumn 2019 2019 2020 quebec budget in line with its action plan to implement the 2030 energy policy the government of quebec indicated in its 2019 2020 budget that it will support the montmagny region in its transition to a lower carbon economy specifically the government announced that an amount of 47 3 million to be spread over the next three budget years will go towards supporting the extension of qda s natural gas distribution system in that region this amount comes in addition to

a lot of people labor under a misconception that president donald trump opposes the federal reserve while the president has leveled a great deal of criticism at the central bank in recent months he has never opposed the fed in principle he s merely expressed frustration that the central bankers won t implement the monetary policy he prefers at this time in fact trump wants the fed to lower interest rates and in effect print money just like it did when barack obama was in the white house just before the most recent federal open market committee meeting trump took to twitter to push the fed to cut interest rates china is adding great stimulus to its economy while at the same time keeping interest rates low our federal reserve has incessantly lifted interest rates even though inflation is very low and instituted a very big dose of quantitative tightening we have the potential to go donald j trump realdonaldtrump april 30 2019 up like a rocket if we did some lowering of rates like one point and some quantitative easing yes we are doing very well at 3 2 gdp but with our wonderfully low inflation we could be setting major records at the same time make our national debt start to look small donald j trump realdonaldtrump april 30 2019 this wasn t the first time trump urged the fed to push interest rates down a month earlier trump directed pretty much the same message toward federal reserve chair jerome powell during an interview trump complained about the fed s 2018 interest rate increases saying they really slowed us down trump emphasized that he wants stimulus and called on the fed to resume obama era quantitative easing qe well i personally think the fed should drop rates i think they really slowed us down there s no inflation i would say in terms of quantitative tightening it should actually now be quantitative easing very little if any inflation and i think they should drop rates and they should get rid of quantitative tightening you would see a rocket ship despite that we re doing very well trump also took aim at powell and the central bank last fall as the stock market went into free fall he said the problem i have is with the fed the fed is going wild they re raising interest rates and it s ridiculous he also said the fed is going loco the next day the president doubled down saying i m paying interest at a high rate because of our fed and i d like our fed not to be so aggressive because i think they re making a big mistake these aren t the comments of a man who opposes central bank manipulations of the economy these are the comments of a man who wants the central bank to manipulate the economy in a way that benefits him politically trump can t have it both ways either the economy is awesome blossom or it needs the fed to intervene ironically the president s call on the federal reserve to cut rates and resume quantitative easing in effect print money sends extremely mixed messages on the one hand the president says the united states has the best economy in the history of forever but if that s the case why would the fed need to cut rates conventional wisdom dictates that central banks should normalize rates in a strong economy they cut rates during a recession as the fed did in the years after the 2008 financial crisis to stimulate the economy once the economy recovers the central bank gradually brings rates back to normal as mainstream monetary policy prescribes unless trump wants to argue that a 2 5 percent interest rate is normal which of course is absurd his call for rate cuts in a booming economy doesn t make sense he can t have it both ways either the economy is awesome blossom or it needs the fed to intervene the fed s monetary heroin in the wake of the great recession the federal reserve effectively lowered interest rates to zero in 2008 and kept them there for seven years in 2015 the central bank boosted rates for the first time and followed up with one hike in 2016 it wasn t until 2017 that the central bank began to normalize in earnest hiking rates seven times over the next two years the fed initiated its last rate increase in december of last year the federal reserve also began to unwind quantitative easing in 2018 by shedding assets from its balance sheet for more on quantitative easing and tightening click here but last fall the impact of rate hikes and quantitative tightening began to ripple through the economy the stock market tanked in effect the federal reserve spent nearly a decade manufacturing an economic recovery out of piles of debt and by pumping up asset bubbles like the stock market it accomplished this by creating trillions of dollars in new money out of thin air and pumping it into the economy the fed announced a pause in rate hikes and an end to balance sheet reduction that stabilized the markets at least for the time being rising interest rates don t bode well during a central bank manufactured boom built on debt the fed s pivot toward tighter monetary policy pricked the bubble thus the chaos in the markets during the fourth quarter of 2018 when the stock market started going down last fall the fed did a monetary policy 180 it announced a pause in rate hikes and an end to balance sheet reduction that stabilized the markets at least for the time being here s an analogy that illustrates exactly what the fed did we saw the dot com boom bust in the late 90s and early 2000s now the economy is in the midst of boom bust 3 0 think of artificially low interest rates and money printing like heroin the fed injects the drug into the economy and makes it high the partiers have a blast for a while the economy booms asset prices climb but eventually everybody realizes the heroin will cause an overdose at that point the fed starts to take the drug away we all know what happens when you take a drug away from an addict he goes into withdrawal the economy crashes the bubbles burst the boom turns into a bust when things get really bad the fed rushes in with more heroin and the cycle repeats we saw this with the dot com boom bust in the late 90s and early 2000s and the real estate boom bust that followed now the economy is in the midst of boom bust 3 0 trump wants more of the drug trump seemed to understand this when he was on the campaign trail he accurately called the stock market a big fat ugly bubble he questioned the legitimacy of the recovery but now the president owns the bubble he branded the booming economy with a big trump t and that means trump has a problem if the next crash happens before the 2020 election it will likely doom his reelection hopes make no mistake the longer the economy stays high the harder it will crash this explains trump s criticism of the fed he wants the kind of monetary stimulus obama got during the great recession in order to keep the bubble inflated until after the election he needs the central bank to pump more heroin into the addict to keep him going just a little while longer this isn t about trump opposing the fed this is about trump using the central bank for political purposes pretty much like every other politician and make no mistake the longer the economy stays high the harder it will crash
prologue the attack on post war potential begins 1945 1951 dexter white and wallace the chicago tribune s cassandra sounds the alarm few canadians realize the extent of this dependence our lazy even abject imitation of them has caused an uncritical acceptance of ideas and assumptions which are alien to our tradition scholars and other british educated canadians are in a unique position to serve britain through canada s influence on washington as a next door neighbour of the united states canada acts as a connecting link between england and the united states helping to hold the neighbouring republic in line with the dominion s mother country when gen macarthur displeased britain and canada by his efforts to win the korean war canada s oxford educated minister for external affairs lester b pearson complained that american canadian relations had become difficult and delicate macarthur was fired the next day pearson s foreign office staff is packed with rhodes scholars there are 23 among 183 staff officers or one out of every eight who were educated at oxford university england on the scholarships created by cecil rhodes empire builder and diamond mogul who wanted the united states taken back into britain s fold other canadian foreign office members also were educated in england although not as rhodes scholars pearson went to oxford st john s 1922 on a massey scholarship endowed by a canadian millionaire norman a robertson a rhodes scholar balliol 1923 sometimes called the most brilliant member of the british trained inner circle in the government s east block headquarters of the prime minister and the foreign office is another important figure in canada s relations with britain and the united states he is clerk of the privy council and secretary to the cabinet and has been undersecretary of state and high commissioner to britain huxley s unesco doctrine and eugenics the moral for unesco is clear the task laid upon it of promoting peace and security can never be wholly realised through the means assigned to it education science and culture it must envisage some form of world political unity whether through a single world government or otherwise as the only certain means of avoiding war in its educational programme it can stress the ultimate need for a world political unity and familiarize all peoples with the implications of the transfer of full sovereignty from separate nations to a world organization at the moment it is probable that the indirect effect of civilization is dysgenic instead of eugenic and in any case it seems likely that the dead weight of genetic stupidity physical weakness mental instability and disease proneness which already exist in the human species will prove too great a burden for real progress to be achieved thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that is now unthinkable may at least become thinkable the ciia s royal commissions deconstruct and reconstruct the synthetic soul of canada the massey lévesque commission the first wave of attack 1949 1951 the gordon commission the second wave of attack 1955 1957 many canadians are worried about such a large degree of economic decision making being in the hands of non residents might lead to economic domination by the united states and eventually to the loss of our political independence 1957 gordon commission report the glassco commission the third wave of attack 1960 1963 the lamontagne commission s 1967 1973 program for genocide during the early part of the 19th century great britain and to a lesser extent france were fast developing industrial technology and finding ways of fruitfully exploiting science later on the united states moved from technical backwardness to such a level that it could begin exporting to the advanced european countries manufacturing techniques and machine tools so different that the whole approach became known as the american system an english productivity team that visited the united states in 1853 to study this system concluded that men served god in america in all seriousness and sincerity through striving for economic efficiency the most readily accessed example of the contrast of good to evil in modern times has been typified not only by the goodness of the anti monetarist principle on which the original constitution of the united states of america was premised it was also the same principle which had been adopted earlier by the massachusetts bay colony that principle which modern society should trace back to such renaissance geniuses as nicholas of cusa has been demonstrated through the crucial quality of a leading contributing role specific to the included role of u s treasury secretary alexander hamilton it is becoming apparent however that nature is not as passive as we thought that it has its own laws and can revenge itself once its own equilibrium has been disrupted nature imposes definite constraints on technology itself and if man persists in ignoring them the net effect of his action in the long run can be to reduce rather than to increase nature s potential as a provider of resources and habitable space but then an obvious question arises how can we stop man s creativeness how can we proclaim a moratorium on technology it is impossible to destroy existing knowledge impossible to paralyze man s inborn desire to learn to invent and to innovate in the final analysis we find that technology is merely a tool created by man in pursuit of his infinite aspirations and is not the significant element invading the natural environment it is material growth itself that is the source of conflict between man and nature the rates of increase of energy flux density in the concentrations of increasing rates of intensity of power per capita must be now be restarted and also accelerated otherwise the death rates throughout the world are now already accelerating at rates which must be identified as a global trend in planetary human genocide the nominal trend in rising rates of genocide is not the only aspect of this threatening trend the inability to maintain a correlated set of rates of increase of the energy flux density of the human persons per capita must be correlated with the falling rate of intellectual development of the typical u s a or european citizen the so called green doctrine is a doctrine of practice which results in not only human genocide but a decadence in the mental powers and also the relative sanity of the individual human being if general science policy is to accomplish its crucial role effectively it must also develop a system of control to make sure that the strategy will be respected in the detailed decision making process and review mechanisms perhaps more than any other sector of policy science policy requires the careful application of systems analysis the creation of a dynamic and balanced science organization is an urgent necessity a main centre of coordination and financing of science policy is extremely desirable the time has come to create a federal department of scientific affairs enter trudeau s club of rome how the present comes from the future the free choice of the will is a matter of mind part two milner s perversion takes over canada as between the three possibilities of the future 1 closer imperial union 2 union with the u s and 3 independence i believe definitely that no 2 is the real danger i do not think the canadians themselves are aware of it they are wonderfully immature in political reflection on the big issues and hardly realize how powerful the influences are on the other hand i see little danger to ultimate imperial unity in canadian nationalism on the contrary i think the very same sentiment makes a great many especially of the younger canadians vigorously and even bumptuously assertive of their independence proud and boastful of the greatness and future of their country and so forth would lend themselves tactfully handled to an enthusiastic acceptance of imperial unity on the basis of partner states this tendency is therefore in my opinion rather to be encouraged not only as safeguard against americanization but as actually making in the long run for a union of all the britains lord alfred milner 1909canada s history has remained clouded in misinformation and outright lies for over 200 years while basic truths which were once well understood by leading statesmen a century past are now treated as little more than myth or conspiracy theory yet as the above quote written by the pen of lord alfred milner indicates the crafting of the canadian identity has been bought for the price of a national soul the greatest obstacle to canadian sovereignty today is found in the fact that canada s synthetic identity has been constructed over the past decades with the intention of obstructing the establishment upon this earth of a world of sovereign republics which was and still is the outgrowth of the success of the american revolution in 1783 to do so we must investigate how the anglo dutch oligarchy has played through such institutions as the rhodes trust fabian society and round table movement these structures have played a key role in mis shaping every key standard of economic political cultural and scientific behavior which has perverted western institutions to this very day and have come to be identified since the election of donald trump as the deep state part one of our story focused upon the creation of these institutions and their methods of penetrating their networks throughout influential institutions of canada from 1865 to 1943 and the evolution of the round table into the royal institute for international affairs riia in 1919 american branches were created in 1920 with the council on foreign relations cfr and institute of pacific relations while a canadian branch was established in 1928 with the canadian institute for international affairs ciia key canadian patriots resistant to the riia s plans were also introduced in the form of laurier liberals o d skelton and ernest lapointe both of whom aided in influencing the highly malleable prime minister william mackenzie king towards the canadian nationalist cause greater cooperation with american patriots such as franklin roosevelt and away from the riia s plans for world government under the league of nations with the mysterious deaths of skelton and lapointe in 1941 all such resistance melted away and canadian foreign policy become fully infected by rhodes trust fabian agents of the ciia this second segment will address the important 1943 1972 destruction of humanist potential leading up to the reforms implemented by ciia assets lester b pearson and pierre elliot trudeau in their role in advancing milner s program for a new synthetic nationalism by the end of the war canada s productive capacity had risen to unimaginable heights and the vision of unbounded progress free of imperial monetarism was not far off from realization the relationship between canada and the united states was at an all time high with exploding trade and purchasing power that had multiplied threefold from 1939 to 1956 the authority and power won by c d howe was continued into the following 12 years of canadian progress first as minister of reconstruction 1944 1948 then as minister of trade and commerce 1948 1957 when howe realized that his resistance to canada s participation in the unjust korean war of 1950 would not work he changed gears and took advantage of the situation by renewing his broad war powers once again allowing himself to lead canada s economy top down resulting in the great projects with america such as the st lawrence seaway the avro arrow cf 105 supersonic interceptor the transcanada u s natural gas pipeline and especially the civilian use of nuclear power shaped by canada s unique candu technology the secret to canada s progress during and after the war continued to be the national research council nrc re organized and rehabilitated after years of incompetence under its former president general andrew mcnaughton the nrc was a flexible top down organization run by one of howe s brightest engineering students c j mackenzie who went on to become the first president of atomic energy canada ltd aecl with similar mission oriented organizational structures having organically formed in the usa during war the nrc was celebrated and studied as a model for countries the world over the leaders of this institution fought not only to advance nuclear power in canada in order to escape the limits of fossil fuels and accelerate the next breakthrough to thermonuclear fusion but also led the fight to provide their technology to underdeveloped countries such as india and pakistan which were yearning to break free of their british colonial masters the nrc also successfully led breakthroughs in radio astronomy oceanography and industry its basic objective can be summarized in the following model 1 maximize the density of discoveries within a cross country system of self financed and self organized intramural nrc laboratories 2 translate those discoveries into new technological applications and machine tools 3 apply these technologies as efficiently as possible into the industrial productive system to increase the productive powers of labor 4 force university curricula and behavior to adapt by such creative upshifts as quickly as possible ensuring that no fixed formulaic patterns of thought could encrust themselves upon the minds of students or professors the cultural economic scientific factors of canada s post war dynamic were on a new trajectory of true independence founded on a commitment to progress which the british empire now mobilized all of its energy to destroy the great fear of lord milner laid out in 1909 of union with the united states guided by unbounded scientific and technological progress was now underway peaking with a 1948 call for a north american customs union advocated by howe and leading fdr statesmen in the united states that had not yet been purged by the cold war witch hunt led by senator mccarthy sadly now under the vast influence of the british empire s mind control one of mackenzie king s last acts in office was the destruction of this proposition after king s 1950 death c d howe continued on as minister of trade and commerce under king s successor louis st laurent 1948 1957 having ensured that fdr s postwar vision for a world of sovereign nation states would not come to fruition after his untimely death in april 1945 the first of a series of ideological barrages was hammered into canadian and u s policy beginning with the installation of wall street tool harry truman as president and with him the advent of the truman doctrine centering on the rhodes milner agenda of anglo american empire guided by churchill s design of british brains and american brawn while fdr was still alive his allies led by harry dexter white and henry wallace were capable of fending off john maynard keynes attempts to structure the bretton woods agreements according to his own twisted logic of a one world currency steered by the nazi affiliated bank for international settlements and bank of england of which keynes was a director however after fdr s death the last major beachhead of resistance to british recolonization melted the anglo american special relationship was quickly established by truman bringing american foreign policy quickly under the control of the riia networks beginning with truman s unnecessary utilization of two of america s only three nuclear bombs on the already defeated japan which set the foundations for the korean war this policy was ushered in by sir winston churchill s 1946 iron curtain speech in fulton missouri which officially opened the age of the cold war setting a fear based dynamic of tension that resulted in a purging of fdr allies from positions of influence and an influx of british operatives into high prominence the world over in 1951 the enormously influential massey lévesque royal commission attempted to first launch an attack upon the american invasion of media print radio television and cinema which was taking over the canadian psyche one of the primary demands of the 1951 report called for an emergency ban on u s media to keep dangerous american cultural influences from contaminating canada s british traditions with the following words what were these types of alien ideas which concerned the british empire so much at this important period of historical change to get a sense of the fear which massey and his british masters felt regarding the low brow american journalism being read by canadians it is useful to take a sample of a 1951 article written by journalist eugene griffin canada offers fine field to rhodes wards published as one of a series of 16 explosive articles between july 15 31 in the chicago tribune little could the writers of the chicago tribune then know that during the very summer of their writing a young fabian having just returned home from his conditioning under harold laski s mentorship at the london school of economics was working at his first job in the privy council office pco under the watch of rhodes scholar and privy council clerk norman robertson that young fabian went by the name pierre elliot trudeau working alongside trudeau at the time in the pco included his supervisor gordon robertson a young oxford man named marc lalonde and his friend gerard pelletier all three of whom went on to play prominent roles in trudeau s powerful inner cabal 20 years later upon returning to montreal in 1951 trudeau came under the control of f r scott rhodes scholar and co founder of the league of social reconstruction lsr 20 years earlier trudeau s celebrity as an enemy of quebec premier maurice duplessis was cultivated by these rhodes networks through his publication cité libre which served to 1 brainwash young intellectuals according to the journal s existential catholic personalist philosophy of french philosophers jacques maritain and emmanuel mounier on the one side and 2 rally a populist attack on the vatican influenced union nationale un government of duplessis daniel johnson sr and paul sauvé on the other this provincial government had made its renown not only for resisting british control over its destiny but had also been a beachhead of resistance against eugenics laws then being implemented across the continent trudeau worked in tandem with the creepy network of social engineers run from laval university by father george henri lévesque co chair of the massey commission which exploded onto the scene in 1960 as the quiet revolution overthrow of the union nationale after two untimely heart attacks of un leaders beginning with duplessis in 1959 then followed by paul sauvé a mere nine months later another personality whose celebrity was being created in tandem with trudeau s during the 1950s included trudeau s schoolboy chum and british intelligence asset rené lévesque whose popular cbc radio show point de mire served to rally public opinion against the duplessis regime and prepare the culture for the radically liberalizing reforms of the quiet revolution the guidelines for the post 1945 path to a new world order were laid out clearly by sir julian huxley in his 1946 unesco its purpose and its philosophy to what end would this world political unity be aimed several pages later huxley s vision is laid out in all of its twisted detail how could the unthinkable application of a practice which hitler had made repulsive to humanity become adopted by a society which had a faith in progress and unbounded creativity so incompatible with social darwinism huxley s own life s decision to become a founding member of the world wildlife fund wwf in 1961 alongside bilderberg group founder prince bernhard and prince philip provides us a clue it is no coincidence that huxley s role as president of the british eugenics society 1959 1962 also overlapped his co creation of the world wildlife fund wwf the only way such a genocidal policy as eugenics masquerading as objective science could be readopted by humanity was through the dissociation of mind from matter via the breaking of subjective values from objective facts the method chosen was a worshipping of the ugly and irrational in the aesthetics such that judgement could no longer be governed by a sense of truth and beauty while the cold and logical was separated from the artistic and kept in its own cold dark mechanical universe accessible only through statistical methods of thought this is how the modern school system has been divided into two different synthetic worlds of arts and sciences the operatives chosen to carry out this policy were massey s ally sir kenneth clark and sir john maynard keynes who led the scientific management of culture in britain the mental cage chosen to schism values from facts in managing human affairs was named systems analysis a major goal of the massey commission and its unesco design was to create structures that would elevate the humanities and social sciences to the highest pedestal of knowledge and financing paving the road for the later acceptance of systems 8 a club of rome king peccei analysis to be used in the management of society the person assigned to impose systems planning into political practice was the lord president of the british empire s scientific secretariat alexander king working through the organization for european economic cooperation oeec later to become the organization of economic cooperation and development oecd in 1961 under the oecd king became director general of scientific affairs and went on to co found the malthusian club of rome alongside italian industrialist aurelio peccei in 1968 the riia directed its various branches and rhodes trust networks around the world to implement the new eugenics project outlined by julian huxley in 1946 in canada the implementation process occurred between an intervals of 24 years and took the form of four ciia directed operations whose immense influence cannot be overstated they were 1 the royal commission into the arts and letters 1949 1951 2 the royal commission on economic prospects for canada 1955 1957 3 the royal commission on government organization 1960 1963 and4 the senate committee on science policy 1968 1972 each commission was designed with the effect of establishing new structures of thought upon policy makers in the domain of culture economic and science policy which induced the blind acceptance of satanic policies of malthusian eugenics masquerading as environmentalism or the science of saving nature from civilization a society imbued with a moral sense of judeo christian ethic and love of progress and strengthened by the roosevelt led fight against hitler would never accept eugenics a fact well known to the anglo dutch oligarchy a royal commission as the name implies is an invention of the british empire which has been used for centuries in order to create the perception that top down structural changes in all aspects of government were scientifically and objectively achieved the truth is that conclusions of such commissions have always been pre decided by the ruling oligarchy long before the royal commission s experts were even formed usually spanning 2 3 years of studies by a clique of pre selected experts in a given field royal commissions produce voluminous data sets hundreds of thousands of pages of information and then summarize their findings and prescriptions in the form of several summary reports consisting of a 1 2 thousand pages in canada milner protégé vincent massey was assigned the unique responsibility of leading the implementation of this multifaceted program which struck in a series of royal commissions organized entirely by agents of the ciia massey s role was carried out as the chairman of the already mentioned royal commission on national development in the arts letters and sciences 1949 1951 alongside his co chairman father george henri lévesque a social scientist and dominican priest who is rightly credited as the intellectual godfather of the 1960 1966 quiet revolution which secularized the province of quebec and brought in oecd educational reforms all proposals sought by the end of this two year study were directed by the unesco agenda which sir julian huxley laid out publicly in 1946 as massey s former assistant karen finlay wrote in the force of culture vincent massey and canadian sovereignty massey s lifelong governing principle waswhereby massey argued that it is intellectual detachment which empowers someone to truly judge the aesthetic value of art under the logic of unesco and massey s satanic formula it is assumed that since personal subjective values pollute one s judgements on the beautiful and good it is only by disassociating oneself from pre existing values that we gain the ability to judge good and bad art in an objective and thus true fashion the severing of the subjective from the objective thusly also forces the denial of any pre existing standards by which anything could be judged as intrinsically good or bad and thus a ripe field of moral relativism can be harvested evil may then run wild without any fear of being challenged in other words this is a complete denial of the existence of universal physical principlesthe structures against universal physical principles which were proscribed in the massey lévesque commission involved the creation of a more powerful canadian broadcasting corporation a national film board a national library a national art gallery a national art bank a social sciences and humanities research council federal financing of the education system in the humanities and social sciences and canada council for the arts modelled on keynes semi autonomous government financed british template the federal financing of the education system was vital for the commission since it was the only way which oecd and unesco reforms could be ushered in without provincial resistance pre existing teaching practices emphasizing the greek classics which treated students as if they had a soul could only be dismantled efficiently under this top down restructuring applied during the 1960s in which moral relativism darwinism and new math increasingly replaced anything of substance the horrendous explosion of modernist abstract and banal art generously sponsored under the structures of massey s canada council f 1957 gives one a sick sense of the spiritual disease with which the imperialists and sadly their victims are infected both federal control of education and the arts were necessary to pervert the principles guiding both and establish the mental spiritual infrastructure supportive of satanic programs of malthusian population reduction as the new environmentalist eugenics was designed to be to amplify this spiritual disease the massey levesque commission even proscribed the creation of a canadian honours system such that oligarchical habits could more easily be cultivated in canada the creation of the canada council took much longer than massey would have liked and its postponement was due largely to the resistance of the l union nationale government of quebec and its vatican steered catholic church the powerful elements within the quebec catholic church were among the only organized forces on the continent that had competently identified the satanic intentions underlying the oecd unesco reforms being infiltrated into global educational and political systems it were for such reasons that father lévesque and his ideological offspring of social engineers and technocrats at the university laval had become the bitter enemies of the union nationale government the implementation of oecd educational reforms as prescribed by the massey lévesque commission were a primary focus of the quiet revolution the task of applying the reforms was given in large part to two rhodes scholars jean beetz and the creator of the quebec ministry of education paul gérin lajoie soon to become prime minister pierre elliot trudeau played a key institutional role in this process as well in the law faculty at university laval alongside lalonde and beetz with the creation of the canada council the scientific management of culture so necessary to elevate the ugly and banal into a position of respectable authority was ensured and the ground was thus laid for the next steps of the fascist takeover of canada the massey lévesque commission was followed systematically by the royal commission on the economic prospects of canada 1955 1957 chaired by walter lockhart gordon chairman of the national executive committee of the ciia and head of the largest accounting firm in canada clarkson gordon management the commission claimed that canada s sovereignty was threatened by american ownership of canadian enterprise and that drastic action to cut america off from the canadian economy were absolutely necessary as historian stephen azzi demonstrated in his 2007 study foreign investment and the paradox of economic nationalism the claims made by the report were entirely fraudulent the massive upshift in quality of life electricity and social services due to american capital in canada was not even addressed in the voluminous gordon commission reports thus the only relevant purpose of the report was to cultivate a culture of anti americanism and establish political structures limiting foreign ownership of canadian markets and lower the potential living conditions of canadians the biggest farce embedded in the gordon commission quote above of course which azzi misses is that there never was any political independence for canada to lose to americans in the first place since it had never freed itself from the political and economic clutches of its british mother gordon went onto implement his own proposals after leading the cleansing of the liberal party of all c d howe liberals between 1957 1963 becoming finance minister 1963 65 under his long time puppet on loan from vincent massey lester pearson whom he himself selected as early as 1955 to run for leadership of the liberal party after his policies as finance minister failed gordon took over the post of president of the powerful privy council office 1966 68 from his predecessor maurice lamontagne these two commissions were designed to sound the alarm bells against canadian vulnerability to an imminent american imperial takeover of canada s culture and economic resources although no evidence was ever presented that american imperialism had any intention to take over canada the prescriptions to save canada from economic and cultural americanization involved both a negative and positive component negatively each proposed the rapid implementation of quota systems tariff systems to limit foreign input of capital and media while positively proposing centralized structures to coordinate culture and economic management by a vast london steered bureaucracy the already long controlled mass media outlets of canada glamorized their findings and created a mass fear in the popular culture the effect of these two reports also amplified anti americanism to such a feverish pitch that a canadian identity could be established on a fear based negation whereby massey lévesque and gordon following the prescription laid out by lord milner in 1909 crafted a blueprint for a new nationalism this counterfeit nationalism was wrapped up with a brand new national anthem and canadian flag upon lester b pearson s liberals becoming the government in 1963 the delphic perception of canada s sovereign status outside of the actual control of the british empire had to be established for the next wave of canada s post 1963 role in trapping nations into the imperial spider s web of international monetary fund conditionalities unlike the flags of most countries the noble maple leaf as many canadians have still yet to realize has neither now nor ever signified anything whatsoever once the canadian cultural inferiority complex was amplified sufficiently by fear of american imperialism the collective neurotic mindset was now ready for the next wave of the ciia s onslaught unleashed with the royal commission on government organization 1960 1963 chaired by walter gordon s partner at clarkson gordon john grant glassco glassco was the son of william grant and nephew of vincent massey this commission brought in a monetarist accounting framework for managing a bureaucratic structure under the logic of letting managers manage as its mission statement laid out this report examines the adequacy of existing arrangements for making economic and statistical services available for the formulation of policy for administrative decisions and for the service and enlightenment of the public a little later the report laid out the belief that all problems with inefficiency in achieving policy objectives was due to the fact that there are too few economists and social scientists in controlling administrative positions of government very little can be done or ought to be done to discourage the movement of economists into higher administrative posts talented administrators are just as scarce as economists and it would be a mistake for the public service to deny itself any fruitful source of good administrators in preparation for finance minister walter gordon s 1963 65 implementation of his 1957 royal commission financial proposals glassco laid out the new necessary controlling structures to allow gordon to cut off canada from american investments and choke off as much of america from canada as possible when he wrote the immediate concern is the development of a competent central economic staff within the department of finance not to take over work done elsewhere but rather under the direction of the minister of finance to attend to the development of general economic policy for the government as a whole finally glassco pushed for the unesco policy of amplifying the social sciences while attacking the hard sciences like physics and biology with the following the relatively slow development of economic research in canadian universities due to shortage of funds bears on both the quantity and quality of the future supply of trained economists while the government is spending scores of millions annually to support research in physics and biology little financial assistance is given to research in the social sciences the edict of letting managers manage was necessary if the appearance of democracy were to be maintained while the absolute control of society by an accounting priesthood was to be preserved the commission s reports called for the adoption of horizontal aka bottom up planning which was to replace the archaic belief in vertical aka top down intentions from elected officials to the process they were elected to preside over as was the common practice of the nrc and its administrators ironically while bottom up planning according to accounting standards was pushed central control through the treasury board was also promoted by glassco this prescription would ensure that only a small coterie would ever fully have their minds on the whole while every other department were too busy focusing on hyper specialized compartmentalized parts to think about the whole while the nrc and its leadership such as c j mackenzie the student of the late c d howe and the late dr e w r steacy were vigorously attacked by the glassco commission the overhaul which glassco prescribed involved the centralized planning of science policy according to budgetary constraints under the treasury and a science secretariat these positions were to become completely subservient to the control of bureaucrats specialized in accounting and monetary economics degrees advanced through the social sciences and humanities programs outlined by unesco with this new system of management and its anal adherence to planning programming budgeting ppb the problems associated with the governments such as those of c d howe and later john diefenbaker 1957 1963 which intended to actually get something done for the improvement of the nation could not occur this systemic reform was not an end in and of itself however and was merely a necessary stepping stone towards actualizing a system of thinking which would accept the linear language of systems analysis as a guide for conceptualizing the management of humanity under laws of entropy constrained by the limits of fixed resources the glassco report s prescriptions for policy overhaul were to be implemented fully by trudeau several years later as a reward for a job well done glassco was promoted from executive vice president of brazilian traction light and power co to president in 1963 under this position the overthrow of the nationalist brazilian president joão goulart was effected via a military coup d état the free market pillaging of brazil created a model applied even more aggressively a decade later with henry kissinger s orchestration of the pinochet regime s coup in chile the last wave of this ciia run milner project for a new nationalism at least insofar as major structural reforms were concerned took the form of the senate special committee on science policy 1967 1972 more popularly known as the lamontagne commission after its chairman senator maurice lamontagne this commission had the distinction of being the most transparent in its satanic intention to ban creativity and impose malthusian constraints un naturally upon the management of human affairs the report is especially relevant as it begins with the acknowledgement of the american system of political economy which it then attempts to destroy by lies and ridicule by identifying the fact of creativity s relationship to technological advance and technological advance s relationship to increased growth and productivity embedded self consciously in the american system founded by u s treasury secretary alexander hamilton and his mentor benjamin franklin lamontagne a student of george henri lévesque and key member of the gordon commission twelve years earlier established his commitment to defend the principle of empire the most active defender of the american system during the 20and 21century lyndon larouche 1922 2019 has subsequently described contrast between the forces active today the following terms lamontagne s allegiance to the monetarist forces opposing the american system can be clearly seen when lamontagne let his true intention shine forth when he wrote in vol 2 of his 3 volume report thus lamontagne has established that it is man s creativity itself that must be stopped if the supposed fixed equilibrium of nature will remain unchanged by technology this is the root morality of the current global environmentalist religion which lamontagne was at the forefront of unleashing since lamontagne admits that his ideal solution of destroying man s creative impulse is itself an impossibility like the zeus of aeschylus s prometheus bound he never the less finds a resolution to this problem by introducing a perverse alternative when he wrotethus creativity and its fruits of technological progress are acceptable only if they reduce the assumed conflict between man and nature posited by lamontagne bad technology in lamontagne s formulation has the effect of increasing humanity s powers of productivity and thus increase the entropy in his fixed ecosystem based economy if on the other hand we promote technologies of a low energy flux density form such as windmills solar panels and biodiesel which lead to the reduction of man s powers to exist then technology can be defined as a good thing this is the genocidal intention of the british empire expressed in all its nakedness which has been the primary target of american statesman and founder of the science of physical economy lyndon larouche by the time of the lamontagne commission larouche had already risen to world prominence as the only effective challenger to the british monarchy s genocidal agenda of lowering the energy flux density underlying society s material and intellectual existence larouche has subsequently fought for 50 years to defend the truth of mankind s scientifically verifiable relationship to the universe as being governed by everything which lamontagne and his anglo dutch masters hate mankind s necessity for unbounded scientific and technological progress expressed as the unending obligation to increase the productive powers of labour the concept which larouche has used to guide mankind s mandate for progress is the increase of energy flux density of cycling of atoms through the biosphere and human economy shaped by upgrades of new platforms of technologies compare larouche s view on energy flux density with the cynical rubbish promoted expressed by lamontagne above what larouche is describing is the simple fact that without a constant increase of energy flux density of the system and each individual within that system then the domination by a green doctrine which sets value upon forms of energy and behaviour which reduce mankind s power to accomplish work is destined to exterminate the population trapped within that system the effect of destroying the means to increase the energy flux density of the system ie creativity means that a policy of genocide is the only alternative for a ruling oligarchy how would such a logic of genocide be accepted by citizens and administrators who are animated by the inspired faith in scientific and technological progress as was still largely the case during the late 1960s for this task lamontagne had already let the cat out of the bag when he wrote in vol 1 with the linear language of systems analysis the minds of those trying to manage any intrinsically non linear process became sufficiently crippled with statistics and compartmentalization that their ability to see either 1 a whole top down process or 2 the tragic consequences of their own foolish beliefs was destroyed similar to the logic adopted ten years earlier with the state run canada council which provided top down grants to certain types of art music and social theories compatible to an oligarchy though abhorrent to natural human sentiment the lamontagne commission called passionately for a centralized financing and planning body in order to fund those types of applied technologies and pure research which were compatible with the genocidal aims of an oligarchy but would never be accepted by a society imbued with even a little common sense and human compassion in this spirit lamontagne exclaimed that lamontagne is referring of course to the creation of the canadian ministry of state for science and technology mosst which was modelled on the british system and kept under the full control of the treasury board and its balanced accounting system mosst and the treasury board redirected canadian science into the dark ages and its new emphasis on ecosystems management and conservation instead of nation building the new wisdom advocated by lamontagne demanded that science now be shackled to market demand instead of future orientation after the rhodes trust directed ouster of the well intentioned but incredibly naïve conservative prime minister john diefenbaker in 1963 all of the measures proposed by these four commissions were enforced vigorously by lester b pearson and the rhodes trust ciia networks that had risen to prominence under him and then fully by pearson s replacement the former justice minister pierre elliot trudeau in 1968 along with trudeau came fellow ciia assets from the privy council office gerard pelletier and another disciple of father lévesque named jean marchand both of whom were active with trudeau s cité libre the new reformers of quebec became the new reformers of canada under trudeau the application of systems analysis as a cover for population reduction and fascism were fully carried into the top down management of government on all levels and the club of rome of alexander king and his canadian collaborators such as maurice strong maurice lamontagne roland mitchener former governor general michael pitfield personal aid to trudeau and head of privy council office alastair gillespie rhodes scholar and 1st mosst c r nixon privy council office marc lalonde rhodes scholar trudeau advisor and head of prime ministers office ronald ritchie national advisor rennie whitehead asst sec to mosst and ivan head head of prime minister s office had set its putrid roots firmly into canadian soil officially when the canadian branch was established informally in 1970 this nest was directly responsible for the creation of environment canada which had applied systems analysis in order to transform what was once a policy of water and energy development centred on a national mission towards ecosystems management a strict dualism between civilized humanity characterized by change and the unchanging pure equilibrium of nature was assumed as law and with this assumption a new green religion arose masking its fascist intentions behind a new canadian nationalism centred not around a love of freedom or development but around a fear of both american and russian aggressors and unfortunate admiration for britain the lies of the past are looking pretty ugly shall we find the strength within ourselves as canadians to look upon this disfigured ugliness which we are told is our heritage in order to recapture the vision of canada s sovereign potential as a great pioneering nation which held the imaginations of men such as wilfrid laurier o d skelton c d howe and john diefenbaker shall we pick up upon the organic creative evolution that was so scarred and disfigured when franklin roosevelt died and build such long overdue projects as the north american water and power alliance championed by the kennedy brothers in the 1960s and lyndon larouche today shall we rebuild our destroyed infrastructure along upgraded magnetic levitation train technology powered by advanced fourth generation nuclear thorium reactors and begin to taste the breakthrough of fusion shall we let go of the false genocidal notion of unchanging ecosystems and allow ourselves to see human beings as a species above and beyond everything else known in the biosphere in that we are unique in our power to comprehend and wilfully transform those processes of nature in a way that improves and speeds up their evolutionary progress towards ever higher states of energy flux density that really depends on you tune in next week for the origins of the deep state part three what is the fabian society and

atoms of the heavy isotope of hydrogen deuterium to slow the fast moving neutrons enough for appreciable absorption and splitting of the nuclei of unstable fissile isotopes such as uranium 235 without the need to enrich the uranium 235 above its low natural abundance of 0 7 relative to the non fissile uranium 238 the absorption of neutrons by the nuclei of relatively stable non fissile isotopes such as the much more abundant isotopes uranium 238 or thorium 232 transmutes these heavy elements into the chemically distinct but fissile isotopes plutonium 239 and uranium 233 which vastly expand the potential of nuclear power for mankind 3 canadian scientists such as c j mackenzie and e w r steacy were integral in shaping the colombo plan which served as a conduit in its early days for technology transfers to underdeveloped countries after america canada was the 2nd country in the world to have civilian nuclear power in the form of its nrx research reactor in the context of president dwight eisenhower s 1953 atoms for peace program canada provided large scale transfers of its nuclear technology to developing countries first to india with a contract signed in april 1956 with the cirus research centre constructed in 1960 and then soon after to pakistan with the karachi nuclear power plant design supplied by g e canada in 1966 canada helped india construct two other reactors named rapp 1 and rapp 2 but contracts were soon ended for decades due to the creation of nuclear weapons by both countries as an effect of british manipulated conflict by the late 1960s the emphasis on development was shifted from technology sharing and real nation building towards external monetary aid and appropriate technologies that wouldn t change the supposed fixed cultural patterns of indigenous peoples in canada this imperial re orientation was overseen by sir maurice strong who was assigned to create the canadian international development agency cida in 1968 for this purpose 4 st laurent and howe attempted to keep canada s dynamic of growth and close relations with the united states as strong as possible throughout their time in office until they were overthrown

an article called the present status of sterilization legislation in the united states which demonstrates the eugenicists anger with the quebec church the opposition of the roman catholic leaders

chain was given to vincent massey 39 the official formation of the canadian club of rome took place only in 1974 although trudeau was an enthusiastic participant at club of rome meetings even sponsoring the 1971 conference in montebello quebec which gave birth to the work limits to growth the following year he did not become an officially registered member until out of office trudeau remained close friends with alexander king and according to former u s ambassador thomas enders trudeau referred frequently to club of rome thinking on the need for new political and moral approaches trudeau s renown as a club of rome representative was so great that after aurelio peccei s death in 1984 rhodes scholar j gordon king revealed that trudeau was even asked to become peccei s replacement a post which he turned down due to political reasons at that time in 1877 while laying out his agenda for the formation of a secret society to recapture britain s lost colony of america and the submission of inferior races ie non anglo saxon under the control of a renewed british empire cecil rhodes wrote his confessions of faith in which the following explicit mission statement can be read i contend that we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence look again at the extra employment a new country added to our dominions gives i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence i look into history and i read the story of the jesuits i see what they were able to do in a bad cause and i might say under bad leaders why should we not form a secret society with but one object the furtherance of the british empire and the bringing of the whole uncivilised world under british rule for the recovery of the united states for the making the anglo saxon race but one empire we know the size of the world we know the total extent africa is still lying ready for us it is our duty to take it it is our duty to seize every opportunity of acquiring more territory and we should keep this one idea steadily before our eyes that more territory simply means more of the anglo saxon race more of the best the most human most honourable race the world possesses to forward such a scheme what a splendid help a secret society would be a society not openly acknowledged but who would work in secret for such an object rhodes agenda had manifested itself upon his death in 1902 with the creation of the rhodes scholarship trust whose trustees included lord rothschild and lord alfred milner the canadian imperialist george parkin had even left his post as headmaster of upper canada college in toronto in order to serve as the 1st head of the scholarship trust from 1902 1922 both parkin and milner went on to mentor a young vincent massey

frederico president and chief executive officer thank you robert and welcome to everyone joining today s call in the first quarter of 2019 assured guaranty once again established new per share highs for shareholder equity operating shareholder equity and adjusted book value we continue to be the leading municipal bond insurance company and made further progress in building the markets for our financial guarantees in the international infrastructure and structured finance markets in terms of new business production our diversified underwriting strategy once again proved its value during the quarter each of our financial guaranty businesses u s public finance international infrastructure finance and global structured finance made a meaningful contribution for u s public finance municipal bond yields declined throughout the first quarter of 2019 and fell more rapidly after the fed announced an indefinite halt to interest rate increases lower yields limit demand for our guarantee as some investors forgo the extra security in favor of achieving more yield the yield decline was most pronounced at the long end of the curve where the negative effects of our premiums is greatest because they are calculated as a percentage of total debt serviced over the life of each transaction some of the yield pressures due to the strongest net quarterly inflows to the municipal bond mutual fund since that data was first collected in 1992 possibly because people preparing their federal tax returns were realizing that taxes at municipal bonds are one of the few remaining tax strategies after assuming the tax deductions were eliminated or capped by the 2017 tax law changes also during the quarter our credit spreads narrowed particularly in the a bbb categories where we insured the majority of our transactions the spread between a and aaa 30 year munis ended the quarter at 43 basis points the tightest level in 11 years under these conditions insured primary market penetration for the industry was approximately 5 of par volume and 16 of the deal count however as in recent quarters more than half of the a rated transactions utilized bond insurance in spite of the market pressures brought by low interest rates and tight spreads in terms of the overall municipal par issued in the first quarter the 22 year over year growth was deceptively large because volume in the first quarter of 2018 was suppressed by arrest issue bonds during the uncertainty about a pending tax reform that prevailed near the end of 2017 using the first quarter of 2017 as more a typical reference point first quarter volume in 2019 would be down 13 on that basis during the quarter assured guaranty led the municipal bond insurance primary market with 56 shares of both insured par issue and insured transactions sold additionally our secondary market business performed well with secondary market par insured increasing 74 compared with last year s first quarter results in total we insured 2 4 billion of u s public finance par our primary market business includes the largest insured green bond transaction to date where we insured almost 180 million of new york mtas transportation revenue green bonds which were issued with third party climate bond certification we look forward to adding value to more certified green bonds which is a way we can help municipalities lower the cost of reaching their environmental impact goals we also closed another significant healthcare transaction guaranteeing 81 million of taxable massachusetts development finance authority bonds for tufts university medical center for the wellforce health system in the international infrastructure finance we have now recorded new business premiums in 14 consecutive quarters which attest to the expanding understanding of and interest in our guarantees on the part of both investors and issuers outside the united states on march 31 we announced an innovative gbp135 million debt service reserve guarantee for the law schroeder group guarantee replaced existing bank facilities which was the first of its kind for a large u k water and sewerage company we believe this product will be attractive to similar companies who could benefit from a long term alternative to bank liquidity facilities that are subject to annual renewal brexit remains a wild card but not one we expect to have a major impact on our future opportunities we have strategies in place to deal with a number of brexit scenarios including a hard brexit and we are in various stages of executing these plans as events unfold our global structured finance business produced solid first quarter results generating 6 6 million of present value new business production or pvp transactions we insured included a large collateralized loan obligation and secondary market wraps to hold business securitizations we also insured an aircraft residual value insurance transaction we see additional opportunities in these sectors this year as well as in the life insurance sector since the beginning of the year we have seen several developments in puerto rico reassuringly general fund revenue result for the 9 months ended march 31 were 8 above the revised projections in the most recent certified fiscal plan from october 2018 to add some perspective the commonwealth previously disclosed that for the 8 months ended february 28 revenues were up more than 5 against the october revised projection and almost 33 against the original projection in june 2018 s fiscal plan additionally the government announced that a number of private sector jobs now exceeds the level before hurricane maria and according to the puerto rico economic development bank the unemployment rate declined from 10 to 8 8 between march of 2018 and march of 2019 a 12 annual decrease in early may we joined an amended restructuring support agreement with the puerto rico electric power authority along with a group of uninsured prepa bondholders the commonwealth and the oversight board we believe the settlement outlined in the new rsa can be the foundation for an effective consensual plan of adjustment that assures reliable electrical power for the people of puerto rico and we are committed to continuing to work cooperatively with prepa and the other stakeholders along the path to plan confirmation there is an important distinction between assured guaranty and other creditors in the restructuring process we have the ability to add value to the securitization exchange bonds we receive by potentially attaching our guarantee to them when we insured these bonds we believe this could materially improve assured guaranty s overall recovery onto the transaction as well as generate new insurance premiums for that reason our economic results could differ from those reflected in the rsa additionally by ensuring the replacement bonds our economic interest would continue to remain in line with that of the debtor over the long term and we would both benefit from the debtor s improved fiscal solvency and long term economic success there is more work to be done to achieve the plan of adjustment based on the prepa rsa and other credits still need to be addressed we believe strongly in our collateral and legal rights across all of our puerto rico exposures and we ll vigorously enforce these rights if consensual deals are not reached in another matter puerto rico s oversight board is appealing the first circuit s decision following the promesa s procedure for reporting board members is unconstitutional it s impossible to know whether the high court will agree to take the case meanwhile there is the possibility that the president will appoint and the senate will confirm all or some of the existing members we believe senate hearings will be good place to air the differences between congress intent in passing promesa and the actual performance of the board whose actions have frequently worked against the law s expressed goals of respecting constitutional priorities and contractual liens one of the oversight board s most troubling actions is an attempt to have some of the commonwealth yield bonds declared invalid and to call back previously distributed principal and interest from bondholders on the grounds that those bonds were issued in violation of the constitutional debt limit some might argue that we should accept the invalidation because our exposure to the bonds in question is much smaller than our exposure to the unchallenged go bonds and it could increase the likelihood of a full recovery on the rest of the gos and perhaps better recovery on some of our other exposures that view is not only bad business but also an atrocious disregard for the rule of law our position is that all of the general obligation bonds should be provided a 100 recovery because of the constitutional requirements they must be paid before all other government expenses and there is more than adequate funds to service the debt furthermore considering the representations and disclosures the commonwealth presented when it issued the challenge bonds and considering that early acceptance has been to proceeds we consider any challenge much less invalidation of those go bonds illegal and immoral it is very dangerous to allow municipality to borrow money with all the disclosures and legal support required to the time of issuance and then turn around and say sorry we lied and because we lied we won t pay your debt service there are multiple supreme court cases going back to the 19th century that says you can t do that and for obviously good reasons the point is surely known by the highly compensated lawyers and consultants in which the commonwealth is showering hundreds of millions of dollars of local taxpayer money so their position is merely a negotiating ploy that among other things is intended to drive down the market value of the bonds in order to try to justify less than a 100 recovery the commonwealth and oversight board are also trying to persuade the courts to reverse the historical treatment in bankruptcy of special revenue bonds the authors of the relevant bankruptcy provisions enacted in 1988 and the entire municipal bond market understood that it is mandatory not optional for special revenue payments to continue uninterrupted throughout bankruptcy yet the title iii court and the first circuit court have ruled otherwise with serious potential consequences for the stability of the special revenue bond market the contingent effect of the unwillingness of the commonwealth and oversight board to repay puerto rico s debt is already becoming evident rating agencies are reexamining and in some cases changing revenue bond ratings based on the increased uncertainty about the security arrangements for special revenue bonds and more generally the market must now reevaluate what full faith and credit really means and reconsider how much yield is required to compensate for political risk the possibility that officials will be unwilling to pay the general obligation commitments made by their predecessors assured guaranty is prepared to take every case as far as necessary to preserve the security arrangements and laws that underpin the municipal bond market and specifically our legal rights under our insurance policies all the rating agencies that follow us have published opinions that our puerto rico exposures are manageable including moody s about 2 weeks ago and we have few if any other credits in our insured portfolio that are truly problematic our claims paying resources remain near 12 billion even as our net par exposure has declined 63 since 2009 we are in very strong financial position and we ll continue to provide financial protection to our insureds looking at our pipeline of probable business and our other strategic objectives we feel confident that 2019 will be a rewarding year we estimate that the trend in our declining par exposure will reverse in the near term as we re being in insuring businesses of higher rates than our insured exposure amortizes we have and we ll still have significant excess capital that we will continue to manage through share buybacks and dividends and we continue to look for appropriate alternative investments to diversify our corporate profile i will now turn the call over to rob robert tucker senior managing director head of investor relations and communications thank you dominic and good morning to everyone on the call the company s results were strong in the first quarter of 2019 as we once again reached record high operating shareholders equity and adjusted book value per share of 62 and 86 95 respectively these milestones demonstrate the ongoing value created for our shareholders through various strategic initiatives dominic just reviewed our new business production and the progress we have made on resolving our puerto rico exposure and i will cover our share repurchase program later on but first i will review the first quarter 2019 operating results in the first quarter operating income was 86 million or 0 82 per share compared with the 155 million or 1 33 per share in the first quarter of 2018 lower net earned premiums from refundings and higher loss adjustment expenses were the primary drivers of the variance net earned premiums were 118 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared with the 145 million in the first quarter of 2018 as expected after the passage of the 2017 tax act and consistent with the amortization of our insured portfolios subject to call accelerations due to refundings and terminations declined to 26 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared with 52 million in the first quarter of 2018 first quarter 2019 loss and loss adjustment expenses are higher than first quarter 2018 mainly due to higher u s public finance losses offset by lower losses in our rmbs as we have said in the past loss and loss adjustment expenses reported income in any given period differs from economic loss development due to technical difficulty operator senior managing director head of investor relations and communications pardon me it seems like the speaker has went silent robert bailenson cfo cao so it seems like we had some our mics cut out so i m going to repeat the last paragraph first quarter 2019 loss and loss adjustments expenses were higher than the first quarter of 2018 mainly due to higher u s public finance losses offset by lower losses in rmbs as we have said in the past loss and loss adjustment expenses reported income in any given period differs from economic loss development due to the consideration of unearned premium reserve in the calculation of loss and loss adjustment expenses under gaap accounting rules total economic loss development was a benefit of 2 million in the first quarter of 2019 which primarily consisted of a 65 million benefit in u s rmbs offset by increased loss and loss adjustment expenses for certain puerto rico exposures the benefit in rmbs was mainly related to a general increase in excess spread and the improved performance of second lien transactions the economic development attributable to changes in discount rates was a benefit of 4 million in the first quarter of 2019 in terms of strategic initiatives we have continued to repurchase shares in order to efficiently manage our capital position during the first quarter of 2019 we repurchased 1 9 million shares for 79 million at an average price of 41 62 per share since the beginning of 2013 and through the end of the first quarter we have repurchased a total of 96 5 million shares the cumulative effect of these repurchases was a benefit of approximately 15 84 per share in operating shareholders equity and approximately 27 83 in adjusted book value per share since the end of the quarter we have repurchased an additional 853 000 shares at an average price of 46 25 for a total of 40 million bringing the current year to date share repurchases to 119 million or 2 8 million shares cumulative repurchase since 2013 represent about half of the shares that were outstanding at the start of the program as of today our remaining share repurchase authorization is approximately 279 million we currently have approximately 260 million in cash and investments available for liquidity needs and capital management activities at the holding companies insurance regulators to approve the release of capital from our insurance subsidiaries in order to fund share repurchases for example as a first step we saw and in march we received approval for a 100 million dividend from mat to its also parent companies agm and agc this mat dividend will ultimately be recorded as statutory net investment income for agc and agm which is expected to increase the normal dividend paying capacity for agm by 61 million for 2019 and for agc by 39 million for 2020 i will now turn the call over to the operator to give you the instructions for the q a period thank you questions and answers operator operator instructions and our first question today comes from geoffrey dunn with dowling partners please go ahead geoffrey dunn dowling partners analyst yes good morning i guess first question can you give any additional color on the economic development with respect to puerto rico in the quarter was there any residual cofina in it was there any true up related to the prepa rsa or is it just general exposure development that we re seeing in the 61 million robert bailenson cfo cao as you know geoff we respond to all information after the quarter end and so in the case of the first circuit upholding judge swain s ruling on special revenues we reacted to that information because we expected that will then cause any court or any court validation to be taking a longer time and therefore because timing is going out further for recoveries as well as continuing to pay losses we adjusted our probabilities for any go or hda credit on the other side the rsa actually would benefit and we adjusted our probabilities with respect to prepa but net net we had an increase in reserves at economic loss development in puerto rico geoffrey dunn dowling partners analyst and no cofina in there that was done in q4 robert bailenson cfo cao no that was there was nothing for cofina geoffrey dunn dowling partners analyst ok great that s helpful thanks and then can you give any additional color whether it be a range or percentage or anything like that in terms of what the various fees and economic opportunity unwrapping the bonds might do in terms of reducing your loss obviously i don t think the par amortization or the amortization scheduled for the new bonds is out but on the surface you re looking at 20 plus type of hit on prepa you put the other stuff in there i think you said in your release it should be a lot lower economically but can you frame that up any better for us dominic frederico president and chief executive officer sure if you think about it the way that rsa is structured geoff is they re really providing by the surcharge a level of debt service so a fixed amount of payment into the new bond structure so if you can think about the new bonds being issued say at 5 25 on the a bonds and like 7 5 on the b bonds and the way it s structured in these surcharges to provide cash flow to service that debt so you will get given amount of par relative to that interest rate against the debt service payments that are being provided if you then go out and insure those bonds you lower the interest rate therefore you will increase the principal amount of the par that you will be received or will be able to be serviced through the fixed charge going through the surcharge on the electric bills so it s a pickup of par that would then further improve your recovery against the bonds that you re retiring and then two you get paid a premium relative to the insurance of the new bonds as well so if you think about a 50 basis point improvement in the interest rate what does that then do to a fixed stream of cash flow relative to the new par that debt service will be able to provide for that s how you think about the economics being improved geoffrey dunn dowling partners analyst i guess a pointed question do you think this could be a single digit relative write off for you i guess that s a no comment dominic frederico deputy chairman president ceo that s a no comment and remember as we look at this much like cofina we have the option so it s at our option and we re going to look at a what the government is at that time with other covenants or requirements we re going to be made through the operational kind of independence in the operational efficiency of the utility so we can always do uninsured or do an insured it s going to be our choice much like cofina where we still hold those bonds and we still have the option of insuring them to further improve the economics or not depending on how we feel about the government and it s behavior geoffrey dunn dowling partners analyst and then just a quick number question rob do you have a breakout of primary versus secondary for r and pvp robert bailenson cfo cao yes i knew you were going to ask that you are consistent geoffrey so primary we had 10 1 million pvp for 1 point about 1 678 billion of par and in secondary we had 21 5 million of pvp for 338 million of par geoffrey dunn dowling partners analyst thank you operator and our next question comes from allen weinstein ph with elliott investments ph unidentified participant gentlemen thank you for taking my question dominic i wanted to thank you again for your comments about go issuance post 2012 it s about time that someone stood up for the rights of municipal bond holders and i very much appreciate your comments about the validity and claw back attempt on go issuance so thank you for that my question has to do with getting over the hurdle with prepa and combining your interest with mbia currently mbia as you know trades at about 35 of adjusted book value have you given any consideration to partnering or making some kind of acquisition where you could control the outcome of prepa by controlling mbia s holdings dominic frederico deputy chairman president ceo well as you know our goal is to combine or consolidate the entire remaining financial guaranty industry which we ve done in a very accretive way to the ultimate book value and bottom line of the company as well as continue to improve the perception of our insurance policy by improving the rating on those specific bonds that we wind up acquiring through the acquisition of the company and therefore the insurance that they provide as you know we look at everybody all the time we continue to evaluate opportunities as we move along resolving more puerto rico s exposures which tend to be one of the bigger when you think of us in the acquisition world number one we have to look at is what is the capital structure of the target are there three mouse at the table two mouse is there just equity is there surplus notes is there preferred stock is there deferred payment obligations so it s really the complex kind of view of the equity side and then number two we reunderwrite every credit in the portfolio and charge what we determin to be reasonable relative to today s both market conditions and capital charges puerto rico tend to be one of the more contentious credits that you would look at in anybody s portfolio so as those get resolved it simplifies the underwriting side of our acquisition opportunity we still have to deal with the capital side so as we move along puerto rico and hopefully there will be more activity as we go through the year i think it does provide a greater opportunity for assured to continue its consolidation strategy more importantly as those companies start to reach kind of the final conclusion of whatever they re dealing with in their capital structure and portfolios it then becomes a good opportunity for them to either reload their business purpose and in effect go on to their new direction or liquidate the company and basically pay out their shareholders so we think puerto rico in a lot of ways is a good accelerant to further opportunities relative to our consolidation goals unidentified participant thank you thank you i appreciate that operator and our next question comes from bose george with kbw bose george kbw analyst yes good morning yes just one more on the prepa rsa do you think there s a road map to get from the current level to the 67 that s needed if mbia does not join in dominic frederico deputy chairman president ceo well you need 67 and that s currently written in the rsa agreement it doesn t mean you have to stay there so that s number one number two they have voting rights to anywhere between 13 and 17 the number continues to move so you think about that still leaves 83 out there or 87 depending on your perspective and you need 67 and we ve got i think something around 50 now so your guess is as good as mine but i m sure the government will go back and do whatever s necessary to try to enforce this both to get over the necessary threshold or they ll change the threshold one of the two remember in the title vi it s a different voting requirement than in the title iii so that s one thing you have to keep in mind before the plan adjustment requires a different voting calculation than the title vi does bose george kbw analyst so under title iii it could end up being just a lower number that s required to get it over dominic frederico deputy chairman president ceo remember title iii has to have a qualifying quorum to vote and then you need a majority of that qualifying quorum right so it s a different threshold i think at 67 you need the quorum for vote and then majority of the vote of the 67 or whatever that number is that s above the 67 that s title iii title vi on the voluntary restructuring it s what they implied or what they provided for in the rsa that doesn t mean that can t be changed bose george kbw analyst okay great that s helpful and then actually just going back to geoff s question just on the potential quantifying the benefit can you just repeat your answer the 50 basis points at the time so we look at that dominic frederico deputy chairman president ceo well you guys are the quants right so you can figure out what the if you have a given fixed amount of debt service and you lower the interest rate take a number 50 basis points 75 basis points how much additional par can be serviced by that level payment of debts there bose george kbw analyst okay so look at the duration and present value that look at the benefit that way dominic frederico deputy chairman president ceo right and then you ll figure out what the enhancement to par insured over the par value of the bonds against the original 67 and 0 10 on the b bonds and therefore you can calculate what the ultimate recovery is robert bailenson cfo cao as well as the premium that s going to be charged in the transaction bose george kbw analyst ok that s great on top of that yes thank you dominic frederico deputy chairman president ceo you re welcome operator ladies and gentlemen this will conclude the call i d like to turn the conference back over to robert tucker for any closing remarks robert tucker senior managing director head of investor relations and communications thank you operator and thank you all for joining us on today s call i d like to thank you for that if you have additional questions please feel free to give us a call thank you very

firefighting the financial crisis and its lessons ben bernanke henry paulson and timothy geithner penguin books 16 paper the great crash of 2007 2009 stripped american middleclass families of wealth it gave rise to nativist politics on the right and socialism on the left killing credence in neoliberal market capitalism in both the united states and europe it buried the washington consensus that had energized bipartisan support for u s leadership around the world indeed china has replaced the united states as the leading country whose investment drives the global economy in his 2018 letter to shareholders jamie dimon ceo of jpmorgan chase described the state of the union as follows middle class incomes have been stagnant for years income inequality has gotten worse forty percent of american workers earn less than 15 an hour and about 5 of full time american workers earn the minimum wage or less which is certainly not a living wage in addition 40 of americans don t have 400 to deal with unexpected expenses such as medical bills or car repairs given the ample volume of hindsight it takes conviction verging on stubbornness to insist that the united states government did all it reasonably could have done in response according to dimon cumulative economic growth over the last decade has been half of what it would have been in a normal recovery as a result the economy is 4 trillion smaller than it should be in his words that growth certainly would have driven wages higher and given us the wherewithal to broadly build a better country it is widely recognized that the economic disappointments of the last decade made it extremely difficult for the democratic presidential nominee in 2016 to run on her predecessor s record even though unemployment was at last reaching satisfactorily low levels and wages had begun to increase conversely donald trump s successful campaign is often seen as reflecting voter dissatisfaction with the government s response to the financial crisis of 2008 given the ample volume of hindsight it takes conviction verging on stubbornness to insist that the united states government under the bush administration did all it could to prevent the crisis and that both the bush and obama administrations did all they reasonably could have done in response yet in their three separate memoirs numerous public statements and now in their jointly written book firefighting the financial crisis and its lessons the trio of president bush s treasury secretary hank paulson president obama s treasury secretary tim geithner and both presidents fed chairman ben bernanke have made these claims historians will debate the events of 2007 2009 for decades and the leading actors namely the trio of bernanke geithner and paulson should be complimented for their many good steps as well as their willingness to account for their decisions but they were wrong in 2008 and they are especially wrong now to promote the wrong lessons from their experience in firefighting for instance they look to the next crisis and correctly assert that the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic should be able to fully stand behind the obligations of large complicated banks on the brink of failure while winding them down in an orderly fashion but in an fdic resolution shareholders and creditors take some loss the firefighters rejected that approach in 2008 and they continue now to argue that in a crisis it is wrong to ensure that risk takers pay a price for their risk taking such as by imposing haircuts on creditors by arguing that risk takers should be held harmless in the next crisis they are restating the position that tied president obama to one of the most unpopular government actions in history namely the bail out no future president should or would want to take this advice notwithstanding many actions by the trio in emergency conditions their reaction to the recession was not what the country deserved indeed it had at least three serious flaws that we should be revisiting and learning from for next time when a fire seems poised to break out again in the financial sector government leaders should throw water on the sparks instead of waiting for a full fledged conflagration first they bailed out bear stearns in march 2008 let lehman brothers go bankrupt on september 15 2008 and bailed out aig on september 16 2008 in the first of these moves they had another firm buy the failing firm in the middle decision they magnified the losses for everyone by implementing no plan in advance and in the last of these moves the government took control and fired management this unpredictable signaling intensified the dreadful reaction to the lehman bankruptcy the government s sinuous path of decision making inspired a lack of confidence that in turn contributed to the over reaction of the real economy to the financial crisis leading to excessive reductions in investment and employment second at all times the trio s top priority should have been helping the real economy recover from the economic calamities of the great crash at the time it was no secret that domestic construction jobs were evaporating and consumer consumption was falling housing prices had also plummeted ultimately homeowners equity fell from nearly 14 trillion to about 6 trillion but instead of taking actions to help americans the trio and the presidents they advised chose strengthening the financial sector as their primary objective the misguided belief was that by instilling confidence in the balance sheets of big financial firms they could cause benefits to flow through to main street this error in strategic goals led to a series of bad policies first instead of passing what the trio refer to as a small fiscal stimulus composed of tax cuts in february 2008 the republican white house could have joined with the democratic congress to jumpstart more spending second instead of protecting firms from having to take write downs on the debt and mortgage securities they held on their balance sheets the trio could have used the authority of the housing and economic recovery act hera to re finance or restructure troubled mortgage loans or constrain foreclosures in a meaningful way third instead of the modest recovery program enacted in february 2009 the trio could have championed a significantly larger recovery program geithner in a memorandum he co wrote with larry summers likely with bernanke s input too for president elect obama on december 15 2008 recommended that the second economic stimulus to create main street jobs not be greater than approximately 800 billion because an excessive recovery package could spook markets or the public and be counterproductive and fourth instead of returning the 200 billion in unspent bailout money to congress after the big banks had passed the stress tests in 2009 the trio could have spent the unused bailout money to protect homeowners and jumpstart job creation leaders have to trust that the united states can recover from the worst of financial shocks but know that it cannot long survive an ethic of saving the well off at the cost of the rest of the country the third serious flaw in the recovery effort was that the troubled asset relief program was not a good law its principal defect was that paulson could act with no supervision he could buy whatever he wanted including the most spurious assets traded moreover no bank benefitting from the one sided sale would suffer any limitation on bonuses much less replacement of management and the actual amount of government funding would prove more than twice what the banking system actually needed for recapitalization in firefighting the trio acknowledge that the post lehman crisis compelled tarp s passage indeed the trio have argued for a decade that congress would not pass a useful bill without a crisis but it is more accurate to conclude that the trio s approach invited an avoidable crisis in order to pass a bad law indeed the smoke of the lehman explosion was the only reason a bill that awful could be pushed through congress the timing too in retrospect is suspect in september of 2008 for example the trio had told congress that the emergency required weekend action this proved untrue moreover by the time tarp was enacted in october 2008 some of the biggest wall street firms in which paulson insisted on investing did not even need or want the money the tarp legislation is not a model of what was then or is now desirable instead in 2010 dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act wisely used the fdic to guarantee troubled firms obligations while meting out haircuts to equity and debt holders as the method for recovery none of this is to argue that drastic times do not call for drastic measures but when a fire seems poised to break out again in the financial sector government leaders should throw water on the sparks instead of waiting for a full fledged conflagration and if the fire rages anyhow government should not rebuild the burnt towers of wall street while leaving main street to dig out from the rubble the real economy is more important than the financial sector indeed in the next crisis or before the financial sector should help fund through taxes or mandated investment the recovery of the real economy perhaps then the financial sector might not grow as dangerously large as it has exactly what needs to be done when the next crisis hits cannot be precisely predicted but whoever fights that fire must remember that transparent equitable and justice delivering government is not expendable when the going gets tough tough minded government leaders have to trust that the united states can recover from the worst of financial shocks but know that it cannot long survive an ethic of saving the well off at the cost of the rest of the country what theodore roosevelt called the malefactors of great wealth should at least lose some of that wealth as their just deserts are served
carmen richards via ap randy richards a 65 year old farmer near hope n d poses for a photo friday may 10 2019 at the request of the associated press says the tariff war of the past year and a half has hit hard and he was angry that more may be coming richards says he farms more than 6 000 acres of wheat barley soybeans pinto beans and corn and says tariffs have driven up the cost of the raw products he needs to run and supply his business and driven down the prices of what he has to sell washington president donald trump has heightened tensions with china by escalating his tariffs on 200 billion in chinese goods from 10 to 25 as a tool of national policy tariffs had long been fading into history a relic of the 19th and early 20th centuries that most experts came to see as harmful to all nations involved yet more than any other modern president trump has embraced tariffs as a punitive tool against europe canada and other key trading partners but especially against china the second largest economy after the u s the trump administration asserts and many independent analysts agree that beijing has deployed predatory tactics to try to give chinese companies an edge in such advanced technologies as artificial intelligence robotics and electric vehicles beijing s tactics the u s contends include hacking into u s companies computers to steal trade secrets forcing foreign companies to turn over sensitive technology in exchange for access to china s markets and unfairly subsidizing chinese companies trump has also complained angrily about america s gaping trade deficit with china for which he blames weak and naive negotiating by previous u s administrations last july trump began gradually imposing tariffs on chinese imports after friday s increase the administration is now imposing 25 tariffs on 250 billion in chinese goods beijing has counterpunched by taxing 110 billion of american products focusing on agricultural goods notably soybeans in a calculated effort to inflict pain on trump supporters in the farm belt here s a look at what tariffs are and how they work what exactly are tariffs tariffs are a tax on imports they are typically charged as a percentage of the transaction price that a buyer pays a foreign seller to use a simplistic example ignoring real world minimum amounts subject to tariffs say an american retailer buys 100 garden umbrellas from china for 5 apiece 500 total and suppose the u s tariff rate for the umbrellas is 6 5 percent the retailer would have to pay a 32 50 tariff on the shipment thereby raising the total price from 500 to 532 50 in the united states tariffs sometimes also called duties or levies are collected by customs and border protection agents at 328 ports of entry across the country proceeds go to the treasury the tariff rates are published by the u s international trade commission in the harmonized tariff schedule which lists u s tariffs on everything from dried plantains 1 4 percent to parachutes 3 percent sometimes the u s will impose additional tariffs on imports that it determines are being sold at unfairly low prices or are being supported by foreign government subsidies what are tariffs supposed to achieve two things increase government revenue and protect domestic industries from foreign competition before the federal income tax was established in 1913 tariffs were a big money raiser for washington from 1790 to 1860 tariffs produced 90 percent of federal revenue according to douglas irwin an economist at dartmouth college by contrast tariffs in recent years have accounted for only about 1 percent of federal revenue tariffs are meant to raise the price of imports or punish foreign countries for unfair trade practices like subsidizing their exporters and dumping their goods at unfairly low prices they discourage imports by making them costlier they also reduce pressure from foreign competition and make it easier for home grown companies to raise prices as global trade grew after world war ii tariffs fell out of favor the formation of the world trade organization and the forging of trade deals like the north american free trade agreement reduced or eliminated tariffs the average u s tariff is now one of the lowest in the world 1 6 percent the same as the european union s the pew research center reports are tariffs a wise policy most economists say no tariffs raise the cost of imports for people and companies that need to buy them and by reducing competitive pressure they give u s producers leeway to raise prices too that s good for those producers but bad for almost everyone else rising costs especially hurt consumers and companies that rely on imported parts some u s companies that buy steel for example complain that trump s tariffs on imported steel leave them at a competitive disadvantage their foreign rivals can buy steel more cheaply and offer lower priced goods in 2002 president george w bush s administration placed tariffs on imported steel a study financed by steel consuming businesses found that the tariffs cost 200 000 american jobs that year more broadly trade restrictions make an economy less efficient with lesser competition from abroad domestic companies lose the incentive to increase efficiency or to focus on what they do best

sydney australia to understand why the trump administration has struggled to build a global coalition of allies in its trade war with china it helps to understand what is happening in the rolling hills and valleys of australia s southeast and southwest coasts vineyards that once made many crisp white wines and fruity red ones popular with american buyers are now also producing more austere reds favored by a segment of a rapidly expanding market of chinese drinkers since 2008 australia s wine exports to the united states have fallen 37 percent exports to china have risen 959 percent around the globe longtime allies are planning for a world in which the united states is no longer the economic center for all the frustrations of doing business with china including opaque government action and allegations of intellectual property theft the sheer logic of economic geography is proving more significant than historical alliances
today president trump outlines an approach to head off the anticipated retaliation from china over the increase in u s tariffs that began today whether this is structurally possible or whether this is trump s attempt to diminish the leverage carried by vice chairman liu he is an interesting question however the strategy is clear overall u s inflation remains low relative to the economic gains from maganomic policy gdp and wage growth are both exceeding inflation as such now is indeed the best time to confront china president trump notes this today in a tweet inflation in the u s remains low overall at 1 8 now is the perfect time to hit beijing with expanded tariffs however president trump knows china will retaliate through the multinationals on wall street president trump knows china will specifically target the u s agriculture sector china will likely attempt to put pressure on trump by refusing to buy u s farm product the big ag multinationals will go bananas the big ag multinationals those who control food farm production also control key senators they have been purchased through lobbyists this is part of the big club approach strategy wall street and the u s senate will be aligned to support china as a consequence president trump needs to counteract their effort president trump s approach to counteract china s strike against the u s agricultural community is visible in a series of tweets today i don t necessarily agree with the proposal long term but i do understand the short term objective optimum expediency as you can see president trump is proposing to counteract the chinese boycott of u s farm product by using income from the chinese tariffs to purchase the farm product it would appear the u s dept of agriculture secretary sonny perdue would be in charge of the program in the short term this would mean the corporate income losses from big ag multinationals would be offset by u s purchases the dept of agriculture would purchase harvests that exceed the domestic u s supply need president trump is proposing we then give that harvest to nations who need food poor and starving countries in essence income from the tariffs on china would be used to subsidize u s farmers perhaps as a short term optimal solution this is a good plan however the downside is the u s food prices what you pay at the grocery store will remain artificially elevated if there was no intervention domestic farm production would far exceed internal u s consumer demand this would mean prices on u s food products would necessarily drop rather quickly the supply would far exceed demand this over production dynamic is caused by more than 25 years of big ag growth where multinationals have contracted with u s farms to grow and export food product we ve talked about this corrupted and controlled market system extensively here on these pages the process of multinationals controlling farm output is very similar to how the multinationals controlled manufacturing output and moved the process to the place of lowest production costs and highest profits the outputs of u s farms are moved around the globe to the location of highest return it is a controlled market this process has driven up the domestic price of u s food rapidly in the past 20 years the multinational agriculture lobby is massive we willingly feed the world as part of the system but you as a grocery customer pay more per unit at the grocery store because domestic supply no longer determines domestic price within the agriculture community the feed the world production export factor also drives the need for labor labor is a cost the multinational corps have a vested interest in low labor costs ergo open border policies ie willingly purchased republicans not supporting border wall etc to offset the 20 year increase in u s prices the multinational lobbyists paid dc to expand food subsidies snap food stamps ebt benefits this helps their bottom line and shifts tax dollars onto their profit and loss statements this is the exfiltration of american wealth it is a corrupt system the proposal by president trump to shift tariff proceeds to off set farm losses is okay perhaps likely necessary in the short term but once the issues with china are resolved we are still going to have to deal with the underlying cause of this corrupted market process economic security is national security we need to start looking at food production as a national security issue the modern third dimension in american economics here the fed can t figure out the new economics here proof america first has disconnected main street from wall street here treasury secretary mnuchin begins creating a parallel banking system here how trump economic policy is interacting with the stock market here how multinationals have exported u s wealth here
washington president donald trump s combative approach to trade has been one of the main constants among his often shifting political views and he s showing no signs of backing off now even as the stakes intensify with the threat of a full blown trade war between the world s two biggest economies the president went after china on day 1 of his presidential bid promising to bring back our jobs from china from mexico from japan from so many places trump s views on trade helped forge his path to victory in states such as pennsylvania michigan wisconsin and ohio where he linked the loss of manufacturing jobs to the north america free trade agreement and other trade deals he warned the worst was yet to come with president barack obama s proposed trans pacific partnership his trashing of existing and proposed trade agreements grabbed the headlines but he also made clear his view that globalization had been bad for america and that he would use tariffs to protect national security and domestic producers he cited the nation s founding fathers abraham lincoln and ronald reagan as leaders whose footsteps he was following when it came to trade and tariffs our original constitution did not even have an income tax trump told voters in monessen pennsylvania some four months before the 2016 presidential election instead it had tariffs emphasizing taxation of foreign not domestic production no 7 on his list of trade promises in that speech taking on china for its theft of american trade secrets this is so easy i love saying this i will use every lawful presidential power to remedy trade disputes including the application of tariffs consistent with existing trade laws trump said those laws include section 232 of the trade expansion act which trump cited to enact tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from china canada mexico and elsewhere they also include section 301 of the trade act which trump used last year to apply 25 per cent tariffs on 50 billion worth of chinese goods and 10 per cent tariffs on 200 billion dollars of goods that 10 per cent was increased to 25 per cent on friday trump is laying the groundwork to extend the 25 per cent tariff to all of china s exports to the u s of course america s trading partners haven t let trump s tariffs stand without taking similar action themselves farmers boat makers and whiskey and wine producers are just some of the u s industries caught in the middle farming is a very small margin small profit business we rely on lots of volume and lots of sales to generate a profit said brent bible a soybean and corn farmer in lafayette indiana who has seen prices for both commodities drop in the past year we are operating at a loss now trump s philosophy on some issues has evolved over the years he once described himself regarding the abortion issue as very pro choice now his administration promotes him as the most pro life president in american history on trade not so much in trump the art of the deal trump complained of the japanese that what s unfortunate is that for decades now they have become wealthier in large measure by screwing the united states with a self serving trade policy that our political leaders have never been able to fully understand or counteract fast forward nearly three decades and trump declared in his 2015 announcement for the presidency that other nations were prospering at america s expense when was the last time anybody saw us beating let s say china in a trade deal they kill us i beat china all the time trump said trump s approach on trade is a dramatic departure for the republican party but gop lawmakers have declined to take action that would block his tariffs they credit his tactics for getting improvements to a trade deal with canada and mexico to replace nafta and for getting china to the negotiating table president trump is the first president to take china head on said texas rep kevin brady the top republican on the house ways and means committee he said everyone knows i m not a fan of tariffs but i think everyone knows as well that china has been cheating for far too long trump has received some encouragement from democratic leaders senate minority leader chuck schumer d n y tweeted to trump don t back down strength is the only way to win with china current and former officials in the administration believe that voters will give the president credit for standing up to china and not blame him for any pain that may result from the tariffs war overall ap votecast found americans critical in their assessments of trump on trade but that s not the case with his supporters according to the survey of more than 115 000 midterm voters nationwide 45 approved of trump on trade while 53 disapproved among voters who approved of trump s job overall fully 88 approved of his handling of trade while trump casts his tariffs as being paid for by china they actually are paid by the american companies that bring a product into the u s this can help some u s producers though because it makes their goods more competitive price wise still the burden of trump s tariffs on imports from china and other countries falls entirely on u s consumers and businesses that buy imports said a study in march by economists from the federal reserve bank of new york columbia university and princeton university republican leaning business groups such as the u s chamber of commerce have warned that the tariffs threaten to derail the economy and low unemployment rates but with economic growth at 3 2 per cent last quarter and the unemployment

after president donald trump raised tariffs on 200 billion of imported chinese goods trade experts worried that china which has the world s second largest economy will unleash a pandora s box of punitive tactics against american companies the chinese ministry of commerce said thursday that while it hopes the united states can meet china halfway make joint efforts and resolve the issue through cooperation and consultation it would take countermeasures but some economists remained unfazed by the escalating tensions pointing out that while the united states imports more than 500 billion worth of goods from china the value of american exports is only around 130 billion this imbalance means that china is out of ammunition in tit for tat tariff responses it s true that the base on which they can put on additional tariffs is much more narrow than the u s said ludovic subran global head of macroeconomic research at allianz and chief economist at euler hermes but subran and other international trade experts warn not to count china out too quickly the first thing to observe here is that china is not a country of laws it s an authoritarian dictatorship said jacob kirkegaard a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics who warned that american businesses could be hurt by trump s antagonism so from that opening point china is potentially able to play much much dirtier than the united states he will essentially force the chinese government to retaliate in other ways and those other ways can be much more costly to american firms he said that belief is premised on a fundamentally erroneous assumption about how the modern economy works and a lack of concern with how engaged american businesses are involved already in china american manufacturers like automakers have made considerable investments into manufacturing facilities in china and the financial and professional services sectors have a large and profitable presence there these and other multinationals operating in china are vulnerable to a wide array of actions the government could take against them for example chinese officials could slow the customs process for u s products entering the country launch investigations into or spring inspections onto factories hotels or other businesses all activities for which a veneer of plausible deniability would make proving a punitive motive difficult the chinese government could restrict access to its market by stopping american business investment or if the situation worsened mandate that they divest entirely said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics for manufacturers in particular this prospect could be a big hit to the bottom line that would be very disruptive it would be more costly and it would be a mess zandi said the biggest fear is the inability for companies that make profits to repatriate their dividends as easily as they want to financial companies along with legal consulting and other professional service providers could also find themselves facing more hurdles sabran said they could start to show their teeth a little bit and make it more difficult to do business he said they could basically put additional regulatory constraints on these businesses he said such as requiring china based executives to be fluent chinese speakers requiring data centers to be located in china or perhaps most onerous placing capital controls on repatriating profits the biggest fear is the inability for companies that make profits to repatriate their dividends as easily as they want to subran said china s control over a state run media could also be weaponized turning china s millennial middle class against american consumer brands economic patriotism is very high subran said a campaign against highly visible products like gm cars starbucks coffee apple iphones or even boeing jets could damage these companies profitability in china other retaliatory measures at china s disposal could expand the current confrontation beyond trade and into currency markets the other qualitative thing they could do devalue the currency that would be even more extreme to offset the impact of the tariffs on their products zandi said adding that evidence suggests china has been keeping the yuan from falling in value recently a reversal could roil currency markets china could also sell off or stop buying u s government debt a dire prospect given that the united states already faces rising costs to service its growing debt experts think this is less likely in that the tactic would be a double edged sword it would hurt the u s economy but would also seriously depreciate the value of the huge cache of treasuries already held by china but the more unpredictable the dispute becomes the greater the risks to all parties involved the odds that there s a misstep here are rising even if he does take it back he s doing damage zandi said of trump business relationships are about trust and he s blowing this apart

via silverdoctors american farmers are struggling more than ever small u s businesses can t plan for the future consumers are facing much higher prices exactly how is all of this trade deal flip flopping making america great again i mean one month we have a deal one month we don t have a deal one week trump is ready to walk the next week trump is ready to negotiate the best deal ever and now it s happening multiple times a day in that president trump says a deal is coming then he says a deal is not coming and it might look like we will start seeing the flip flopping on an even shorter time frame i m not even sure if that s possible if you haven t heard this contrarian analysis on what the heck is going on with the trade talks it might be worth a listen because it seems all too convenient to blame all of the market turmoil on the uncertainties surrounding the trade deal and that is exactly what the experts are doing but they are missing the point you see there s this phrase and although it is quite graphic it is rather appropriate shit or get off the pot this constant flip flopping on the trade deal isn t helping anybody certainly not americans i get it the us was sold down the river and americans have long since been given the shaft well bohica because we will continue being sold down the river until there is nobody left to sell and the shaft bohica how exactly is it that president master of the deal trump is helping americans with this now years long trade deal in the making dog n pony show what trump should do if he was actually a patriot which he s not so he won t do this is just print out all of the laws deals swaps agreements arrangements and whatevers the united states has ever had with china throw them in a dumpster and light that sucker on fire ok hey half dollar you don t get it man it s complicated hmmm you are either devoid of critical thinking or you re a british system apologist with way too much patience hanging on in quiet desperation may be the english way but it s not the american way if president trump is being anal retentive about all of this which he is he s not only not helping the average american but rather trump is actually hurting us the first three sentences of this friday wrap demonstrate my point the only people who benefit from this b rate soap opera are the deep state globalists which is another way of saying that if it looks like president trump is acting like a deep state globalist well that s because he is a deep state globalist and if it looks natural well that s because it is natural trump is a deep state globalist or as i like to call him deep state in patriot s clothing why can t the red hats see it for the same reason sheep can t see a wolf in sheep s clothing that said will the red hats ever see the man for who he is i don t think so then again when trump loses in 2020 the very same red hats will turn into trump apologists and they will say well he just didn t have enough time to drain the swamp to that i say bollocks just don t read it with a english accent because my english sucks but i digress for some strange reason people have a hard time accepting the truth when they re wrong why i m not sure i m not smart enough to know if i were smart enough i d be some well paid psychologist or a poor n starving philosopher and knowing my luck it would be the latter but there i go again digression here s the thing everybody wants to blame someone or something else think of that demon in an old hag s body otherwise known as hillary clinton she has blamed everything under the sun for that 2016 loss if you believe politicians are actually elected which i don t and that s neither here nor there but is here and there is that hillary never once looked into the mirror to recognize the only place where blame can be found in other words there is no such thing as an excuse and if there is such a thing as blame it is only found in ourselves an example of this in its most simplest form is that i have been thinking that gold would get above 1300 stinkin bucks for three weeks now and i ve also been thinking that silver would get above 15 stinkin bucks for three weeks now and guess what i have bee wrong for three stinkin weeks me wrong yes i am i m the only one to blame for my errors and the deep state globalists like that demon hag hillary or donald j trump they re infallible aren t they everyone thinks we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us so speaking of everyone get ready for everybody and their brother to call for 12 silver i can hear it now but i do think they will be wrong and i do think 14 50 holds but with the technical rejection at the 200 day moving average the experts will be coming out of the woodwork and they ll be emboldened funny how that works isn t it also get ready for the calls for gold to drop to 1150 though it does look like gold s carved out a short term bottom and in addition to not being rejected at its 50 day moving average gold is setting up to punch through it and break out above it which i do think gold will do and i think gold will do it imminently once again it takes over 87 ounces of silver to buy one single ounce of gold notice how even in a market that s manipulated 24 7 the natural move is for the gold to silver ratio to roll over but then again this market ain t nothin natural so also notice the sheer desperation in the cartel as indicated by those massive black candles for the manipulation is so blatant you can almost smell the cartel s fear coming from that chart palladium overshot its sideways channel to the downside just as expected yesterday the price of palladium even fell below the price of gold i don t think traders should go anywhere near platinum with a 10 foot pole and i m talking about long short as options sellers or pretty much anything stackers with deep pockets however still have a great opportunity with the gold to platinum ratio arbitrage crude oil has flat lined since trump fooled the public into thinking he s the reason for the pull back there is no denying the golden cross however but that s only if the technicals still matter which for the moment is pretty indisputable that they don t matter copper is now riding its 200 day moving average copper is turning out to be one tough call right now because i m looking for a major move higher but the technicals are suggesting copper wants to triple bottom but even if copper does triple bottom i m anticipating nations getting a case of copper fever kind of like they have gold fever as a way to stave off us dollar inflation while at the same time loading up on a cheap non perishable and very important commodity the stock market pretty much had to come down this week because while it s bohica for 99 999 of america if at the same time the deep state globalists are also smashing our faces into a steaming pile of fresh dog crap then in my opinion it would be more than highly likely that a few americans blow a lid at the totally rubbed in our faces federal reserve come save the markets at the expense of hard working americans stock market recovery america s mood swings are looking rather bi polarish notice what s happening with the 50 day moving average however ok hey half dollar i ve gotta cut you off for a second man because you keep throwing out this fancy technical analysis making it seem like you understand this stuff but you never mark up your charts like all the real traders out there so what s up with that do they even trade bro besides there is not enough time for spoon feeding so learn why i m saying what i m saying and how theoretically it relates to the markets for example i ve been looking for yield on the 10 year note to fall even more in the short term as the stock market comes down sure enough yield is falling but the stock market has barely started its move lower if this is indeed the start of the move and furthermore while we re at it find out what happens to gold as real interest rates fall even further into the negative the us dollar is still in its holding pattern with all of this trade deal talk which for some reason only includes analysis on china and nothing more which really is ironic because well what happens to the dollar when the best sequel to a trade deal ever nafta 2 0 commonly referred to as the usmca is finalized spoiler alert the us dollar is going to take a hit as in it ll be devalued the video above also explains why a dollar devaluation is coming not sure how to head into this beautiful weekend in may i would suggest not heading in any particular direction just go with the flow and be confident in your stack there will come a time when we will be rewarded and if there s a reset which i do think is coming we ll be rewarded beyond our wildest dreams if you re the person who likes a plan well let me break up these ill placed words for something that could be a plan to me this looks like a great one is shooting fish in a barrel still a thing cause that s what it s like if you re a buyer of real physical gold silver right now like shooting fish in a barrel why well this t co n5iibxbcun silverdoctors com silverdoctors may 9 2019 markets are closed until sunday night great prices and all weekend long so go out and get some ammo cause it s so easy right now the dollar is pretty strong gold silver dirt cheap a whole lot of fish not many um fishermen with guns fine then hunters ready good fish yes stack accordingly half dollar
kevin freking associated press washington ap president donald trump s combative approach to trade has been one of the main constants among his often shifting political views and he s showing no signs of backing off now even as the stakes intensify with the threat of a full blown trade war between the world s two biggest economies the president went after china on day 1 of his presidential bid promising to bring back our jobs from china from mexico from japan from so many places trump s views on trade helped forge his path to victory in states such as pennsylvania michigan wisconsin and ohio where he linked the loss of manufacturing jobs to the north america free trade agreement and other trade deals he warned the worst was yet to come with president barack obama s proposed trans pacific partnership his trashing of existing and proposed trade agreements grabbed the headlines but he also made clear his view that globalization had been bad for america and that he would use tariffs to protect national security and domestic producers he cited the nation s founding fathers abraham lincoln and ronald reagan as leaders whose footsteps he was following when it came to trade and tariffs our original constitution did not even have an income tax trump told voters in monessen pennsylvania some four months before the 2016 presidential election instead it had tariffs emphasizing taxation of foreign not domestic production no 7 on his list of trade promises in that speech taking on china for its theft of american trade secrets this is so easy i love saying this i will use every lawful presidential power to remedy trade disputes including the application of tariffs consistent with existing trade laws trump said those laws include section 232 of the trade expansion act which trump cited to enact tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from china canada mexico and elsewhere they also include section 301 of the trade act which trump used last year to apply 25 percent tariffs on 50 billion worth of chinese goods and 10 percent tariffs on 200 billion dollars of goods that 10 percent was increased to 25 percent on friday trump is laying the groundwork to extend the 25 percent tariff to all of china s exports to the u s of course america s trading partners haven t let trump s tariffs stand without taking similar action themselves farmers boat makers

has evolved over the years he once described himself regarding the abortion issue as very pro choice now his administration promotes him as the most pro life president in american history on trade not so much in trump the art of the deal trump complained of the japanese that what s unfortunate is that for decades now they have become wealthier in large measure by screwing the united states with a self serving trade policy that our political leaders have never been able to fully understand or counteract fast forward nearly three decades and trump declared in his 2015 announcement for the presidency that other nations were prospering at america s expense when was the last time anybody saw us beating let s say china in a trade deal they kill us i beat china all the time trump said trump s approach on trade is a dramatic departure for the republican party but gop lawmakers have declined to take action that would block his tariffs they credit his tactics for getting improvements to a trade deal with canada and mexico to replace nafta and for getting china to the negotiating table president trump is the first president to take china head on said texas rep kevin brady the top republican on the house ways and means committee he said everyone knows i m not a fan of tariffs but i think everyone knows as well that china has been cheating for far too long trump has received some encouragement from democratic leaders senate minority leader chuck schumer d n y tweeted to trump don t back down strength is the only way to win with china current and former officials in the administration believe that voters will give the president credit for standing up to china and not blame him for any pain that may result from the tariffs war overall ap votecast found americans critical in their assessments of trump on trade but that s not the case with his supporters according to the survey of more than 115 000 midterm voters nationwide 45 approved of trump on trade while 53 disapproved among voters who approved of trump s job overall fully 88 approved of his handling of trade while trump casts his tariffs as being paid for by china they actually are paid by the american companies that bring a product into the u s this can help some u s producers though because it makes their goods more competitive price wise still the burden of trump s tariffs on imports from china and other countries falls entirely on u s consumers and businesses that buy imports said a study in march by economists from the federal reserve bank of new york columbia university and princeton university republican leaning business groups such as the u s chamber of commerce have warned that the tariffs threaten to derail the economy and low unemployment rates but with economic growth at 3 2 percent last quarter and the unemployment rate at 3 6 percent trump isn t changing strategy now tariffs will make our country much stronger not weaker just sit back and watch trump

costs are higher than short term rates but the curve has sent a false alarm at least once before and some believe it is doing so again above all because huge fed purchases have depressed longer yields

the failure of the u s china trade talks was another blow for american farmers who just a few weeks ago thought a trade deal was imminent they now begin another growing season with uncertainty about who will buy their crops and whether they can break even frustration mounts among farmers as china trade talks break down the breakdown was another blow for american farmers who just a few weeks ago thought a trade deal was imminent they now begin another growing season with uncertainty about who will buy their crops and whether they can break even though mr trump pledged friday to help farmers part of the coalition that put him in office there were signs of frustration they raised questions about his negotiating tactics they said they were worried about what would come next given an already struggling agricultural economy update trump s trade war has political implications for trump ahead of his 2020 reelection bid he risks angering farmers a key voting bloc damaged by low crop prices caused in part by the trade war trump defends his latest china tariffs with an eye on the 2020 election trump would effectively raise revenue from u s consumers and redistribute it to farmers doing so could undercut a core strategy the president s campaign has deployed so far in the 2020 race accusing democrats of advocating for socialism we re all socialists now many people are just torn because people want to support the president of the united states said nancy johnson the executive director of the north dakota soybean growers association but it s very stressful to be in the middle of these very challenging negotiations because you re the person who can t take hope to the banker to get his loans for operating mr trump is generally popular in the rural midwest he carried all but two midwestern states in 2016 won more than 90 percent of the vote in some agrarian counties and has been praised for rolling back environmental regulations but mr trump s propensity for imposing tariffs has clashed with the free trade instincts of the region s farmers who have watched lucrative overseas markets for soybeans and other crops shrivel for some midwestern republicans in congress the use of tariffs has been a rare point of disagreement with president trump mr trump who has accused china and other countries of taking advantage of the united states on trade said he would help farmers weather the trade uncertainty on twitter mr trump suggested that the united states government could buy billions of dollars of agricultural products from farmers sonny perdue the agriculture secretary said separately that mr trump had directed his department to work on a plan to help farmers in shelby county ind phil ramsey said he appreciated the president s reasons for revisiting trade deals but said the ailing farm economy had been brutal in deeply personal ways he said he was going without health insurance to save money he said he has delayed some equipment purchases i was very patient a year ago said mr ramsey who grows corn soybeans and wheat i ve gone from being very patient to being very anxious the lack of a trade deal was especially painful in nebraska which saw widespread damage from flooding in march the damage there as well as in parts of missouri and iowa has turned cropland into debris fields and forced some farmers to evaluate whether they could continue making a living off the land it s a little bit of piling on when you have so many different things that you re struggling against said steve nelson the president of the nebraska farm bureau obviously the trade issue is one of those the weather is one of those lance atwater 29 who farms corn and soybeans near ayr neb escaped the worst of the flooding but said that he has seen prices for some of his crops plunge mr atwater a republican who voted for mr trump said he was eager for a trade deal but taking a wait and see approach on the president s policies he s claimed that he ll get these trade deals worked out and that it will be a better deal mr atwater said on friday as he hauled grain that s what we re wanting to see see those results jerry mohr 66 a fourth generation farmer who grows corn and soybeans near eldridge iowa said he was growing frustrated i admire the president for wanting to make change said mr mohr a republican who voted for mr trump but now we need to perform if the president comes through on what he says he was going to do it would be hard for him to lose mr mohr said if he doesn t it s going to be hard for him to win farmers like baseball fans are eternally optimistic next season will be better and that is their weakness it takes losing everything before they are finally willing to admit to themselves the truth that it s over it is time for farm country to wake the hell up and to reject the gop and the personality cult of donald trump they are killing farmers way of life a paper published in march by economists pinelopi goldberg the world bank s chief economist pablo fajgelbaum of ucla patrick kennedy of the university of california berkeley and amit khandelwal of columbia business school also found that consumers and u s companies were paying most of the costs of trump s tariffs it also went a step further after factoring in the retaliation by other countries it concluded the main victims of trump s trade wars had been farmers and blue collar workers in areas that supported trump in the 2016 election workers in very republican counties bore the brunt of the costs of the trade war in part because retaliations disproportionately targeted agricultural sectors the authors wrote trump s trade war where american workers are hit hardest the latest escalation in president trump s trade war will expose to tariffs roughly 11 million u s workers who are employed in industries that produce targeted goods why it matters industries affected by the brinksmanship are mostly concentrated in rural deeply red already struggling parts of the country with political consequences for trump and republicans in 2020 explanation of the map the map tracks the geographical impact of both current and threatened retaliation the darker a county the higher the concentration of affected industries there driving the news u s tariffs on 200 billion in chinese imports are about to rise from 10 to 25 an escalation of the trade war that could hurt major importers and trigger even more painful retaliation by china employment in rural and low population counties can be exceptionally vulnerable to gyrations in the global economy said mark muro a senior fellow at the brookings institution in a small county a single meat packing establishment can provide hundreds of jobs and make up a large share of that county s total employment he told axios in september a prior report by muro and others at brookings inspired this analysis methodology we calculated the concentration of industries in each county compared with the national average to get there we gathered lists of goods facing tariffs from canada china mexico and the european union the data is from the u s chamber of commerce and the bureau of labor statistics quarterly census of employment wages as economist paul krugman explains trump is terrible for rural america rural america is a key part of donald trump s base in fact rural areas are the only parts of the country in which trump has a net positive approval rating but they re also the biggest losers under his policies what after all is trumpism in 2016 trump pretended to be a different kind of republican but in practice almost all of his economic agenda has been g o p standard big tax cuts for corporations and the rich while hacking away at the social safety net the one big break from orthodoxy has been his protectionism his eagerness to start trade wars and all of these policies disproportionately hurt farm country the trump tax cut largely passes farmers by because they aren t corporations and few of them are rich one of the studies by agriculture department economists that raised trumpian ire showed that to the extent that farmers saw tax reductions most of the benefits went to the richest 10 percent while poor farmers actually saw a slight tax increase at the same time the assault on the safety net is especially harmful to rural america which relies heavily on safety net programs of the 100 counties with the highest percentage of their population receiving food stamps 85 are rural and most of the rest are in small metropolitan areas the expansion of medicaid under the affordable care act which trump keeps trying to kill had its biggest positive impact on rural areas and these programs are crucial to rural americans even if they don t personally receive government aid safety net programs bring purchasing power which helps create rural jobs medicaid is also a key factor keeping rural hospitals alive without it access to health care would be severely curtailed for rural americans in general what about protectionism the u s farm sector is hugely dependent on access to world markets much more so than the economy as a whole american soybean growers export half of what they produce wheat farmers export 46 percent of their crop china in particular has become a key market for u s farm products that s why trump s recent rage tweeting over trade which raised the prospect of an expanded trade war sent grain markets to a 42 year low it s important to realize by the way that the threat to farmers isn t just about possible foreign retaliation to trump s tariffs one fundamental principle in international economics is that in the long run taxes on imports end up being taxes on exports as well usually because they lead to a higher dollar if the world descends into trade war u s imports and exports will both shrink and farmers among our most important exporters will be the biggest losers why then do rural areas support trump a lot of it has to do with cultural factors in particular rural voters are far more hostile to immigrants than urban voters especially in communities where there are few immigrants to be found lack of familiarity apparently breeds contempt rural voters also feel disrespected by coastal elites and trump has managed to channel their anger no doubt many rural voters if they happened to read this column would react with rage not at trump but at me so you think we re stupid but support for trump might nonetheless start to crack if rural voters realized how much they are being hurt by his policies what s a trumpist to do one answer is to repeat zombie lies a few weeks ago trump told a cheering rally that his cuts in the estate tax have helped farmers this claim is however totally false politifact rated it pants on fire the reality is that in 2017 only about 80 farms and closely held businesses that s right 80 paid any estate tax at all tales of family farms broken up to pay estate tax are pure fiction another answer is to try to suppress the truth hence the persecution of agriculture department economists who were just trying to do their jobs the thing is the assault on truth will have consequences that go beyond politics agriculture s economic research service isn t supposed to be a cheering section for whoever is in power as its mission statement says its role is to conduct high quality objective economic research to inform and enhance public and private decision making and that s not an idle boast along with the federal reserve the research service is a prime example of how good economics can serve clear practical purposes now however the service s ability to do its job is being rapidly degraded because the trump administration doesn t believe in fact based policy basically it doesn t believe in facts period everything is political and who will pay the price for this degradation rural americans trump s biggest supporters are his biggest victims as i ve said before democrats running for president and for federal offices in farm country need to devise an agriculture commodity trade policy that allows farmers to sell their product at prices high enough for their operations to be financially viable and to turn a small profit and no longer need to be on federal farm subsidy assistance just to survive if democrats can offer a solution to the farm economy they can win back those farm states that republicans have taken for granted update the president has told advisers and top allies that he has no intention of pulling back on his escalating trade war with china arguing that clashing with beijing is highly popular with his political base and will help him win reelection in 2020 regardless of any immediate economic pain according to the washington post trump believes china tariffs will help him win reelection so trump is good with tanking the economy and bankrupting america s farmers so are his sycophant cult followers in congress gop sen tom cotton says farmers tariff sacrifices are nothing compared to the military s sure americans particularly american farmers will bear the economic brunt of trump s decision to increase tariffs and china s own retaliatory tariffs on 60 billion worth of imported u s goods but in the grand scheme of things cotton says it s a small price to pay especially compared to the sacrifices that the men and women in the u s military make so boo hoo farmers too bad for you losing your farm that has been in your family for generations and is the only way of life you have ever known is but a small price to pay for the greater glorification of our dear leader donald trump republicans have completely lost their minds please support independent journalism on blog for arizona 5 10 20 30 50 100

today president trump outlines an approach to head off the anticipated retaliation from china over the increase in u s tariffs that began today whether this is structurally possible or whether this is trump s attempt to diminish the leverage carried by vice chairman liu he is an interesting question however the strategy is clear overall u s inflation remains low relative to the economic gains from maganomic policy gdp and wage growth are both exceeding inflation as such now is indeed the best time to confront china president trump notes this today in a tweet inflation in the u s remains low overall at 1 8 now is the perfect time to hit beijing with expanded tariffs however president trump knows china will retaliate through the multinationals on wall street president trump knows china will specifically target the u s agriculture sector china will likely attempt to put pressure on trump by refusing to buy u s farm product the big ag multinationals will go bananas the big ag multinationals those who control food farm production also control key senators they have been purchased through lobbyists this is part of the big club approach strategy wall street and the u s senate will be aligned to support china as a consequence president trump needs to counteract their effort president trump s approach to counteract china s strike against the u s agricultural community is visible in a series of tweets today i don t necessarily agree with the proposal long term but i do understand the short term objective optimum expediency as you can see president trump is proposing to counteract the chinese boycott of u s farm product by using income from the chinese tariffs to purchase the farm product it would appear the u s dept of agriculture secretary sonny perdue would be in charge of the program in the short term this would mean the corporate income losses from big ag multinationals would be offset by u s purchases the dept of agriculture would purchase harvests that exceed the domestic u s supply need president trump is proposing we then give that harvest to nations who need food poor and starving countries in essence income from the tariffs on china would be used to subsidize u s farmers perhaps as a short term optimal solution this is a good plan however the downside is the u s food prices what you pay at the grocery store will remain artificially elevated if there was no intervention domestic farm production would far exceed internal u s consumer demand this would mean prices on u s food products would necessarily drop rather quickly the supply would far exceed demand this over production dynamic is caused by more than 25 years of big ag growth where multinationals have contracted with u s farms to grow and export food product we ve talked about this corrupted and controlled market system extensively here on these pages the process of multinationals controlling farm output is very similar to how the multinationals controlled manufacturing output and moved the process to the place of lowest production costs and highest profits the outputs of u s farms are moved around the globe to the location of highest return it is a controlled market this process has driven up the domestic price of u s food rapidly in the past 20 years the multinational agriculture lobby is massive we willingly feed the world as part of the system but you as a grocery customer pay more per unit at the grocery store because domestic supply no longer determines domestic price within the agriculture community the feed the world production export factor also drives the need for labor labor is a cost the multinational corps have a vested interest in low labor costs ergo open border policies ie willingly purchased republicans not supporting border wall etc to offset the 20 year increase in u s prices the multinational lobbyists paid dc to expand food subsidies snap food stamps ebt benefits this helps their bottom line and shifts tax dollars onto their profit and loss statements this is the exfiltration of american wealth it is a corrupt system the proposal by president trump to shift tariff proceeds to off set farm losses is okay perhaps likely necessary in the short term but once the issues with china are resolved we are still going to have to deal with the underlying cause of this corrupted market process economic security is national security we need to start looking at food production as a national security issue the modern third dimension in american economics here the fed can t figure out the new economics here proof america first has disconnected main street from wall street here treasury secretary mnuchin begins creating a parallel banking system here how trump economic policy is interacting with the stock market here how multinationals have exported u s wealth here

in florida vouchers win ground but courts may have ultimate say collapse chikara parks is a registered democrat and a huge fan of public schools the single mom of four school aged children is also a fan of vouchers ms parks who is african american has with the help of florida s tax credit scholarship for families with limited resources parlayed her children s struggle in public schools to success at two private schools mount zion christian academy and academy prep center of st petersburg the choice and autonomy have been empowering she says for her children and for herself as a single mom it s hard for some people to know their worth and know what they are able to do she says by phone vouchers help parents to understand that and be more heard and that is an amazing thing ms parks has become an outspoken advocate for a growing constituency across the u s and specifically in florida where a constitutional battle over the approach is brewing on thursday gov ron desantis signed a law that expands the state s use of vouchers which allow taxpayer dollars to fund tuition at private and religious schools the legislation creates 18 000 new vouchers with a ceiling of 77 250 of household income per year firmly middle class in a state with low taxes and a low cost of living in 2006 the private school portion of a previous effort was struck down by florida s supreme court but after his election last fall governor desantis named three conservative jurists to the state s highest court creating an all republican nominated top bench that could act as a shield for legal challenges to this new law in that way florida s decision to test constitutional boundaries infuses a larger national debate about school reform and the very nature of public schools the new test reflects a more clear cut partisan divide in the courts where courts have traditionally tended to rule simply on questions of church and state and where now conservatives see this as a matter of economic freedom of making a choice says christopher lubienski who studies school choice policy at indiana university bloomington the problem adds professor lubienski is that the political push for vouchers has been accompanied by an ideological pushback against oversight that s why i wouldn t call a laboratory as much as pushing the envelope laboratory implies that they are interested in what the results are here it s more about seeing how far they can push it and play it out in the courts given a growing focus on kitchen table issues by both parties florida s legal test of equity achievement and accountability is likely to resonate across much of middle america going into the 2020 election the state s voucher expansion marks a tremendous moment of uncertainty says derrell bradford executive vice president of 50can a national school choice organization after all we have been working our way down a series of policy ideas since the clinton administration and we have learned a lot the world changes the politics of the world change we are relooking at our assumptions momentum in the courts the issue has been intensified by a rightward shift on the u s supreme court that could have implications on issues ranging from school choice to abortion rights adding fuel to the fire the trump administration is pushing for a federal tax credit scholarship for families to attend alternate schools unlikely to pass muster in a democrat controlled house the prospect of expanding choice is already creating an uneasy alliance of republicans with low income moms like ms parks as well as white urban liberals who support choice programs because they don t want to send their kids to struggling and often majority black and hispanic neighborhood schools more choices and more freedom in education will ultimately mean better experiences and more excellence at every school secretary of education betsy devos told a gathering of education journalists during a question and answer session in baltimore this week i often cite florida as a really great example she said adding that even the students staying in neighborhood schools are doing better because having competition and having comparisons forces to do some things they wouldn t have done previously the u s supreme court in 2002 ruled that a voucher program because it was part of a state s overall effort to provide an education to all children was religiously neutral four years later the florida supreme court sidestepped the question of taxpayer dollars going to religious institutions when striking down part of the state s opportunity scholarship program it instead focused on a uniformity of education requirement that it deemed precluded state funding of private schools today florida s family empowerment scholarship program may see a different fate conservatives hope the majority of the state supreme court now sees their role differently than the previous majority jeb bush the former governor who led the state s early school choice efforts said in a recent podcast with the tampa bay times in that interview he also called the voucher expansion the civil rights issue of our time growing demand amid objections milwaukee pioneered the first modern school choice program in 1990 and 18 states currently offer some form of tax credit scholarship arizona ohio indiana and louisiana have made some of the biggest forays into choice which today represents a mix of tax credits vouchers charter schools and homeschooling the democratic party and teachers unions have historically opposed voucher programs arguing they are a backdoor way to destabilize even destroy public schools by rerouting their source of taxpayer funding to private often religious schools no program however rivals the one in the key presidential swing state of florida in 1996 mr bush s bid began with four charter schools today it involves 700 million a year spent on a dizzyingly diversified school landscape large parts of which are only lightly regulated by the department of education an estimated 1 6 million of florida s students 47 percent of school age children now attend a school outside their zone unable to directly fund private schools florida lawmakers built a massive scholarship system of corporation funded tax credits that has now fallen short leaving some 13 000 low income students across the state waiting for a 7 700 year check to attend a private school the new law is expected to offer them some relief what we are seeing in florida is the blossoming of the idea that different kids learn in different ways and also the realization that every school is not going to be perfect says jon east a former st petersburg times journalist and current policy advisor to step up for students an advocacy group weighing vouchers and equity in depth studies of school choice systems in louisiana ohio indiana and elsewhere have shown mixed results a 2017 analysis by martin carnoy an education professor and economist at stanford university found scant evidence that students who receive vouchers do better on tests than their public school peers to professor carnoy that suggested an ideological preference for education markets over equity and public accountability is what is driving the push to expand voucher programs the big questions turned on the future of not just of those students attending private institutions but what happens to the public schools the florida education association which represents state teachers is planning a may 18 statewide summit in orlando to discuss what the organization says in a statement is an attack on public education that involves a massive new giveaway of public funds to unaccountable institutions data has shown that voucher students tend to be more college going according to northwestern university economist david figlio one of the nation s top voucher policy experts professor figlio also notes that emerging data from florida and elsewhere shows vouchers have modestly positive effects on student outcomes proponents note that florida was the only state to show improvements in three of four core competencies in the 2017 national assessment of educational progress also known as the nation s report card given those dynamics professor figlio says the voucher expansion may ultimately say less about church state separation and more about oversight can we as a society tolerate using public funds to send kids to relatively crappy private schools says professor figlio author of several studies on choice policy for ms parks the parent the battle over school choice addresses something deeper than politics she says vouchers have given her a sense of true equity that her children s futures are as important as those whose families have more resources and influence i just feel like with the whole democrat versus republican thing there s too much energy put into it she says there s always a bigger picture but i feel like if you have vouchers leave it alone let the people who need help let us get it let us do what we need to do to give our children the same exact education that your children are getting it shouldn t be about anything else staff writer stacy teicher khadaroo contributed reporting from baltimore

time trump said trump s approach on trade is a dramatic departure for the republican party but gop lawmakers have declined to take action that would block his tariffs they credit his tactics for getting improvements to a trade deal with canada and mexico to replace nafta and for getting china to the negotiating table president trump is the first president to take china head on said texas rep kevin brady the top republican on the house ways and means committee he said everyone knows i m not a fan of tariffs but i think everyone knows as well that china has been cheating for far too long trump has received some encouragement from democratic leaders senate minority leader chuck schumer d n y tweeted to trump don t back down strength is the only way to win with china current and former officials in the administration believe that voters will give the president credit for standing up to china and not blame him for any pain that may result from the tariffs war overall ap votecast found americans critical in their assessments of trump on trade but that s not the case with his supporters according to the survey of more than 115 000 midterm voters nationwide 45 approved of trump on trade while 53 disapproved among voters who approved of trump s job overall fully 88 approved of his handling of trade advertisement while trump casts his tariffs as being paid for by china they actually are paid by the american companies that bring a product into the u s this can help some u s producers though because it makes their goods more competitive price wise still the burden of trump s tariffs on imports from china and other countries falls entirely on u s consumers and businesses that buy imports said a study in march by economists from the federal reserve bank of new york columbia university and princeton university republican leaning business groups such as the u s chamber of commerce have warned that the tariffs threaten to derail the economy and low unemployment rates but with economic growth at 3 2 percent last quarter and the unemployment rate at 3 6 percent trump isn t changing strategy now tariffs will make our country much stronger not weaker just sit
