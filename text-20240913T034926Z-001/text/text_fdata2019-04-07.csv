published monday 8 april 2019 print disqus by david chapman if the market does not rally as it should during bullish seasonal periods it is a sign that other forces are stronger and that when the seasonal period ends those forces will really have their say edson gould stock market analyst findings forecasts 1902 1987 early in march 1960 dr arthur f burns called on me burns conclusion was that unless some decisive action was taken and taken soon we were headed for another economic dip which would hit its low point in october just before the elections richard m nixon 37th u s president six crisis 1913 1994 but how do we know when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values which then become subject to unexpected and prolonged contractions as they have in japan over the past decade alan greenspan fed chairman 1987 2006 speech to american enterprise institute 12 5 96 b 1926 halleluiah it s april april is the number one month for the dow jones industrials dji since 1950 with 47 up months and only 22 down months so far so good this month alas it is only the number 3 month for the s p 500 the russell 1000 and 2000 and the number 4 month for the nasdaq but the good news is the indices have their best years in pre election years which this is average gain for the dji 4 during pre election years watch carefully for irrational exuberance the indices remain in a potential mode for a blow off so what exactly have the indices done since they bottomed in december 2018 following the steepest decline for the indices since 2008 overall the indices were down roughly 20 only one index has made new all time highs the dow jones utilities dju but many have made new highs for the current move including dow jones industrials dji dow jones transportations djt dow jones composite djc s p 500 russell 1000 russell 3000 s p 100 oex nyse and wilshire 5000 not making new highs for this move so far are value line vle russell 2000 s p 400 mid cap s p 600 small cap and kbw bank index so far the new highs for the move range from barely to laboured however most of the indices have crossed a point that suggests new all time highs we await since the low in december the dji has gained 21 3 while the s p 500 is up 23 0 the dji remains off about 1 5 from its all time high seen on october 3 2018 while the s p 500 is also off about 1 3 but its all time high was seen on september 21 2018 its october 3 high was only marginally lower note these are based on closes not actual highs and lows we can t help noting that the volume on this up wave is not strong there were rumours that the plunge protection team was active at the bottom of the market so who is the plunge protection team ppt well their real name is the working group on financial markets the ppt was created in 1988 under president ronald reagan its purpose is to provide financial and economic recommendations during turbulent times the ppt was created in the wake of the 1987 stock market crash the group was charged with enhancing the integrity efficiency orderliness and competitiveness of our nation s financial markets and maintaining investor confidence the group is headed by the secretary of the treasury and its board includes the chairman of the fed the sec and cftc the group is quite secretive they do not release reports and they are not widely covered if they were asked about their activities they would probably respond with no comment but it is widely accepted that the ppt intervenes in markets the ppt is a favourite of conspiracy theorists but others also intervene in the markets it has been well known that for months corporations were buying their own stock back it is an activity that creates no economic benefit however it does help push stocks higher something else that could be helping to push stock markets higher is the off the books spending of the u s government it was only in 2017 that a michigan state university economist mark skidmore found 21 trillion in unauthorized spending primarily by the departments of defense and housing the study covered the years 1998 2015 the study was triggered by a former assistant secretary of housing and urban development catherine fitts who had uncovered unauthorized spending by in particular the department of defense documents are found at it is highly possible some of these funds found their way into the stock market central banks also play a role in the rise of stocks markets over the past several years the massive injection of liquidity through quantitative easing qe from the federal reserve the ecb and the boj has seen their balance sheets explode from just over 3 trillion back in 2007 to roughly 14 trillion in 2019 as the chart below demonstrates the s p 500 rose almost in lockstep with the rise in the fed s balance sheet as reductions began that eventually moved from qe to qt the s p 500 and other markets faltered given the anticipation that surrounded the announcement from the fed of no more interest rate hikes coupled with the ending of qt the stock market has been rising since despite all this liquidity that has been poured into markets over the past several years gdp growth has been largely below previous recovery periods now the global economy is beginning to falter and central banks around the world are noticing it and have expressed a higher level of concern the world economy is expected to grow only 3 3 in 2019 according to forecasts from the world trade organization wto and the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd see the chart below the fed has expressed its concern by becoming more dovish interest rate hikes for 2019 have been dropped and as noted qt ends in september source www stlouisfed org www bloomberg com source www oecd org www bloomberg com www goldcore com there is growing concern about the global economy a number of factors are beginning to weigh on analysts global trade has taken a downturn in recent months u s china trade talks continue trump claims that an epic deal is close but as we have seen in the past this can change suddenly from we are close to a deal to no deal the problem is given the trade wars that have been ongoing since january 2018 they are actually taking a toll the biggest impact is being felt in the key nations of u s china and germany but the eurozone japan and others are also feeling it source www cpb nl en worldtrademonitor www bloomberg com www goldcore com the biggest decline in exports is being seen in china year on year exports from china have tumbled 20 7 to february 2019 but china is not the only one u s exports peaked in may 2018 and since then they have been generally in a downtrend meanwhile the u s trade deficit has been in a steady uptrend since early 2016 it is ironic that the trade deficit is rising under trump when he vowed to put an end to it china exports source www tradingeconomics com u s balance of trade source www tradingeconomics com germany is also experiencing a slowdown in its exports which is showing up in a falling balance of trade the trade surplus reported in december 2018 was the lowest in three years january was only marginally better germany balance of trade source www tradingeconomics com no wonder so much is riding on a solution to the u s china trade talks april could well be a key month for this bloomberg has noted that many of its gauges are not particularly rosy they help support the thesis that trade is faltering if global trade falters then recessions could follow source www conference board org www gartmanletter com source www conference board org www gartmanletter com the chart above is rather interesting it is a ratio of u s economic index to u s lagging economic index they are come from the conference board of the u s www conference board org this ratio should be rising instead it has been falling and is now hitting some of its lowest levels in over forty years it is lower than it was during the 2008 financial crisis as dennis gartman of the gartman letter www gartmanletter com notes the ratio has been useful in the past for calling recession bottoms except this time it just keeps making new bottoms and we are supposed to be in the good times there are many other factors at work that are helping to weigh on the global economy as noted trade is a major factor but so are others like brexit one of the biggest potential drags for the global economy is the extremely high level of debt there are growing concerns about debt china s shadow banking system and real estate market the u s s leveraged corporate loan market and the eurozone banking system particularly italy plus continued concerns about deutsche bank the high u s dollar is also taking its toll as currency crises grip turkey argentina and wherever there are us denominated loans in foreign countries a slowing global economy should be negatively impacting the stock markets but they keep chugging higher as some indices are now not too far from their all time highs seen back in 2018 there seems to be a what me worry attitude but as long as the signs remain positive the stock market will continue to move higher and since this is april it is poised to live up to its reputation as the number one month for the stock market trump is at it again okay he has never really stopped president trump is continuing his bashing of fed chairman jerome powell calling on the federal reserve to cut interest rates by 50 bp and stimulate the economy by bringing back qe and end qt trump has been criticizing the fed almost from the time he was elected yet he appointed jerome powell to replace janet yellen you see trump wants to get elected again in 2020 and he knows that a booming economy will help his chances considerably the impact of his 1 5 trillion tax cut is waning and the trade wars are slowing things down with a negative impact on the u s china and even germany plus others so trump wants to goose things as we head into the 2020 election here comes qe4 he thinks it will create a rocket ship for the economy the reality is it would be like adding gasoline to a fire and there will be a big explosion to help things along he is planning on nominating allies to the two vacant seats on the fed the candidates herman cain a failed 2012 presidential candidate who faced allegations of sexual harassment and stephen moore an adviser of trump s and a conservative economist who has criticized the fed the trouble is neither has been officially nominated and both would have to pass the senate neither candidate is considered ideal for the fed cain was ceo of godfather s pizza and moore was a wall street journal editorial writer neither have a monetary or economics background both have personal issues many believe that if they are nominated they will not pass the senate but trump has kept up his pounding of powell the fed is an independent agency and while the president appoints the fed chair he does not nor does the fed report to the white house other presidents have also tried to influence the fed two of the more famous ones were richard nixon and arthur burns and paul volcker and ronald reagan the latter is where things almost crossed the line volcker faced intense pressure from reagan leading up to the 1984 election in a memoir from the new york times www nytimes com volcker was summoned to the white house to meet reagan and his chief of staff james baker they met in the library reagan apparently never said a word but baker did the president is ordering you to not raise interest rates before the election baker told volcker volcker was stunned he actually had no plans to hike interest rates at the time but he was stunned by the affront on the independence of fed volcker later realized the meeting was held in the library because there were likely no recording devices in the room as there would have been in the oval office but powell like volcker had to use the same words i can t respond to that because the federal reserve system is autonomous while trump complains that the fed s monetary policies are loco he should look at his own calls to cut rates and juice the economy with more qe if he wants to see what is really loco consider that unemployment is at a multi year low at levels last seen in the 1960s the fed rate remains below the core inflation rate and has since 2008 the longest sustained period of negative spreads between the fed rate and inflation since the 1970s overall interest rates remain at historical lows despite that real gdp growth remains below previous recoveries although in general gdp growth has been in a downtrend for years despite years of qe and massive debt growth we illustrate this in the charts below

of the trends see the glossary at the end of this article new highs lows refer to new 52 week highs lows source www stockcharts com like thomas the tank engine the s p 500 keeps chugging along oh it has little bumps now and then but the current advance is so far one for the books since the low on december 26 2018 the s p 500 is up 23 3 this past week the s p 500 gained 2 1 helped along with some decent economic numbers including the jobs report that came out on friday other indices were up as well the dji gained 1 9 the djt jumped 3 1 the nasdaq was up 2 7 and the russell 2000 small cap index gained 2 8 the tsx composite joined the party gaining 1 8 and the tsx venture exchange cdnx was a bit of a laggard but still gained 0 5 overseas the london ftse 100 was up 2 5 despite all the shenanigans related to brexit the paris cac 40 was up 2 4 and the german dax gained 4 2 for germany what recession in asia china s shanghai index ssec jumped 5 0 while the tokyo nikkei dow tkn gained 2 8 happiness all around yet all we hear from the doom and gloomers is the world is going to end oh this bull will end at some point but not today despite decent economic numbers that may not be spectacular and a rising stock market a president wants to ignite it even further with interest rate cuts and qe4 april is the best month of the year and so far it is proving to be the case but next month is may and the old saying is sell in may and go away of course the other saying is buy when it snows sell when it goes okay it has stopped snowing but there is still snow on the ground in some places should be all gone by may our expectations are that the s p 500 should soon make new all time highs after all we are only 47 points away or 1 6 we have passed the point that suggested we should make new highs and most indicators are still pointed up so up we will go 2 800 becomes a new line in the sand a break below there signals trouble and a break below 2 700 would say the bull is over otherwise as wall street and bay street love to say buy buy buy source www stockcharts com we d like nothing better than to see a significant divergence between the s p 500 and the cumulative nyse advance decline line but the only divergence we are getting so far is no new highs on the s p 500 and rising highs on the nyse advance decline cumulative it is supposed to be telling us that the s p 500 should be making new highs and if it follows the nyse advance decline line it should make a significant higher high so far it s not is this the divergence normally the divergence comes when the s p 500 makes a higher high but the nyse advance decline does not we saw that at the highs in september 2018 nonetheless the nyse advance decline line continues to suggest that that the s p 500 should eventually make new all time highs source www stockcharts com what stands out with this monthly chart is two things first the rise in the s p 500 since the lows in 2009 have been on decreasing volume secondly the rsi appears to have topped months ago with the highs in january 2018 note how many months the monthly rsi spent above 70 we have often said that just because an indicator like the rsi is overbought oversold in a bear market doesn t mean that a top or bottom is imminent the rsi went over 70 in early 2017 and stayed that way for a year it made a lower high when the s p 500 moved to new all time highs in september 2018 now the s p 500 is moving higher again indicating it is poised to make new all time highs once again but the monthly rsi is nowhere near its former highs and we suspect it might not even go over 70 this time that would signal to us one two three higher highs for the s p 500 but three lower highs for the rsi and that spells significant trouble when the markets turn down source www stockcharts com the vix volatility indicator a measurement of fear and greed in the market has fallen to its major support line we ll see if it can break through that level or actually turn up even as the s p 500 continues to march higher that would be a significant divergence and suggest that the s p 500 is getting closer to a top if it breaks below this uptrend line then the vix would be confirming the rise in the s p 500 source www dshort com we slipped in this chart from advisor perspectives www advisorperspectives com that shows the performance of what they call the generic big four indicators performance since the end of the recession back in june 2009 the big four are employment industrial production real sales and real income employment and income have been relatively strong even though overall employment appears to lag the others real sales are starting to dip but it is only one month so it s too early to tell what this shows us is that generally the u s economy is doing well too bad trump doesn t seem to understand that and is demanding that the fed cut rates and bring in qe4 source www stockcharts com while the s p 500 appears to be headed to new all time highs the small cap s p 600 is lagging badly oh maybe it will catch up but we are not optimistic the s p 500 is a mere 1 6 from making new all time highs the s p 600 is 12 3 away from its all time high seen in august 2018 we are of course watching the granddaddy of comparisons between the dji and the djt currently the dji sits 1 8 from its all time high while the djt is 7 7 away major divergences are not unusual at major tops so we ll be watching these closely over the next few months to see if the s p 500 and the dji make new all time highs but the s p 600 and the djt fail to confirm normally in a bull market the small cap leads not this time so this bears watching source www stockcharts com like the u s indices the tsx composite is steaming ahead it broke above that downtrend line from the top and now appears to be headed higher leadership is coming from income trusts consumer staples mining industrials real estate information technology telecommunications and utilities we like the emerging golds energy and consumer discretionary financials are higher but they are not the major leader they are supposed to be health care is faltering but should move higher as should materials but some cautionary notes volume is not exactly robust and the rsi is diverging as the tsx composite moves higher even as the rsi is making a lower high but after saying that there have often been strong up moves on low volume and divergences can go for quite a while before the down move takes place the tsx is now only about 200 points from the july 2018 high it appears poised to make new all time highs but warning signs abound so this is not a market to be buying at this stage except possibly in the three sectors we noted that appear to be emerging support is down to 16 000 but we d have to break down under 15 400 to consider this bull move over the tsx s bullish percent index is nowhere near its former highs so it could be another sign that this is not a healthy move source www stockcharts com are bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies on their way to new bull market it seems that way as bitcoin leaped to over 5 000 before pulling back slightly bitcoin jumped in a matter of hours to the 5 000 level taking others with it the trouble was nobody seemed to know why stories have abounded that 95 of trading in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is fake and manipulated maybe that s all this is a manipulation to sucker in people before they slam it again remember this is not exactly a mature market and it is not particularly transparent the cboe cut back on bitcoin futures but the rival cme has no plans to do the same for the moment possibly the jump in bitcoin was all an april fool s joke as a story was circulated that the sec approved bitcoin exchange traded funds etfs it proved to be false overall bitcoin was up 22 4 on the week it even appears to be breaking out we d avoid it source www stockcharts com as we suspected last week we thought the 10 year u s treasury note may have bottomed at least for the moment this week the yield rose to 2 50 with a high of 2 52 the 2 39 zone is now key support look for a rebound to around 2 60 but above that level a move to 2 75 would most likely get underway above 2 90 the market would suggest a move to even higher levels above 3 for the record yields rose in canada as the 10 year government of canada bond rose to 1 70 from 1 60 recession watch spread source www stockcharts com the recession watch 2 10 spread remains positive it is not signaling a recession anytime soon indeed with at least decent if not spectacular numbers this past week a recession seems a long way off but we agree that things can change quickly the 2 10 spread has been moving in a sideways pattern since december and appears poised to break one way or the other we suspect that will be to the downside and that this time it would turn negative the trouble is the market puts too much stead in the negative spreads and that was the cause of the recent hiccup in the stock market but we agree with some analysts that ultimately it is bit overblown still it is worth watching source www stockcharts com this is a longer term view of the 2 10 spread note how the spread went negative before any recession in the early 90s the early 00s and the 2007 2009 recession as well the first time the 2 10 spread went negative didn t stop the stock market that kept on climbing given the 2 10 spread is still not negative it does not appear to be signaling a recession anytime soon we placed the s p 500 over the 2 10 spread and one can see that s p 500 only turned down long after it first went negative during the early 90s the stock market never did turn down to any great extent but there was a recession nonetheless note how the spread fell sharply and inverted into 1994 and again pulled back into 1998 the stock market faltered at those points but there was never any official recession and the stock market returned to the upside by the time the steepest inversion occurred in 2000 the decline was already underway and the recession was also getting underway more evidence that just because the yield curve inverted it doesn t mean the stock market is about to crash nor does it signal the start of a recession however one can treat it as a warning sign currently the 2 10 spread has not inverted we note that the 3 month 10 year spread inverted briefly but has returned positive our conclusion is that the stock market should continue higher and no recession is imminent but we are in a dangerous phase for the stock market so the strategy should be selling into the rise and if buying buy those sectors that are coming out of a long slumber like golds mining and energy source www stockcharts com while the us index faltered slightly this past week we believe it remains in an up mode that will eventually carry it to around 100 the us index hit a high of 97 10 and then faltered falling back towards the 50 day ma before bouncing it closed off 0 4 on the week the euro and the pound sterling were largely flat on the week the pound is waffling around awaiting brexit but it is coiling suggesting once something is known it could move quickly up or down the us was buoyed by the job numbers on friday while numbers earlier in the week were not bad the us index s breakdown remains at 95 70 and 94 50 the high so far was 97 10 and it barely suggested that the us index should move to new highs above 97 67 a firm move above 97 10 would confirm a move to new highs 96 30 is acting as support but a move under that level could see a decline to 95 70 to test the breakdown line source www stockcharts com gold waffled around this past week losing a small 0 2 silver was off 0 1 but platinum jumped up 6 palladium has lost some of its luster but eked out a 0 3 this week copper prices remain firm even as they were down 1 7 this past week gold continues to play out what we believe is the e wave of a larger abdce type pattern that started with the key high at 1 377 back in july 2016 potential targets for this wave are down to around 1 250 and the 200 day ma following that gold should ignite this e wave could take a few more weeks with a potential low in may or june the move to 1 250 will be a bouncy one both up and down source www stockcharts com this is just a reminder as to how bullish gold looks right now we believe the current weakness will culminate in a wave e to the downside that could draw gold towards 1 250 once that level is achieved gold could take off qe4 maybe this remains a fabulous looking rounding bottom once gold breaks out over 1 375 and especially over 1 400 potential targets are up to 1 700 source www cotpricecharts com despite gold being down this past week the commercial cot for gold actually rose slightly to 35 from 34 long open interest fell almost 22 000 contracts but short open interest fell even more down roughly 55 000 contracts the large speculators cot hedge funds managed futures etc fell to 66 from 69 with long open interest down almost 21 000 contracts and short open interest rose just under 5 000 contracts despite the weakness in gold price the commercial cot is very mildly bullish source www stockcharts com silver prices fell a meagre 1 this past week however we couldn t help but notice that a bunch of silver stocks jumped on thursday this past week the catalyst was an announcement that a small exploration company new pacific metals corp nuag tsxv may have hit upon a large silver deposit at its silver sands project in bolivia some have estimated that it is upwards of 100 million ounces or more of silver okay don t get too excited this is very early exploration and bolivia is not exactly known as a safe investment country still it ignited nuag rising to 2 50 from 1 18 in january 2019 the announcement ignited other silver stocks on april 4 2019 following the announcement nuag s largest shareholders are silvercorp metals svm tsx and pan american silver paas tsx we couldn t help but notice that nuag was being pumped by a newsletter known as golden opportunities it didn t do much however for silver prices nonetheless we like how the silver chart is shaping up we did break down under the 100 day ma and it is pulling the 50 day ma down with it however the 50 day ma remains above both the 100 and 200 day mas prices could be pulled lower to the 14 80 area and still remain in the channel it is shaping up so far as a potential descending wedge triangle which is ultimately bullish but it could spend a few weeks in the wedge before it breaks out we d be concerned that lower prices were ahead if we break under 14 80 but right now we appear to be forming a nice bullish triangle source www cotpricecharts com the commercial cot for silver turned somewhat bullish this past week even as silver fell the commercial cot jumped to 40 from 37 the previous week it is however still has a way to go to get to the 50 that was seen last july august september long open interest jumped by roughly 3 500 contracts while short open interest fell almost 11 000 contracts as well the large speculators cot dropped to 56 from 60 while we don t usually note this we see the small speculators cot retail fell to 70 from 76 none of this suggests that silver is about to take off but we have to view it as a positive sign as silver weakens source www stockcharts com platinum appears to have come alive after months of slumber palladium has done quite well but now appears to be cooling platinum is taking over this is another bullish sign for gold with platinum rallying even as gold and silver falter platinum gained 6 this past week and is now the leader for the metals up 13 8 so far in 2019 palladium has fallen to number 2 up 12 4 meanwhile gold is up only 1 1 while silver languishes down 2 9 platinum has successfully busted above the 200 day ma and the golden cross has been made with the 50 day ma crossing both the 100 day and 200 day mas the breakout suggests a minimum move to 1 030 we note as well that platinum stocks are also perking up source www stockcharts com the tsx gold index fought off weakness in both gold and silver and gained almost 1 this past week the gold bugs index hui was up 0 7 this is a positive development if one wants to be bullish on gold and silver both the tgd and the hui are holding above the 50 day ma as they bounced firmly off of it this past week we like the bullish action of a ratcheting upward chart the pullbacks do a great job in shaking out weak longs and stronger hands step in to buy note however that volume has tailed off on the recent action that is not necessarily bad it is not as if the tgd and the hui are just breaking down a break under 190 would be a bit more bearish and suggest a decline to the next level of support near 184 otherwise we like the bull channel that appears to be forming if the tgd can hold this channel even as gold falls to 1 250 it would be a very bullish sign source www stockcharts com wti oil prices have leaped to their highest level since october 2018 they are now only 14 off the high seen in september 2018 rising oil prices have translated into rising gasoline prices at the pump technically wti oil has broken out over the 200 day ma a positive sign the so called golden cross with the 50 day ma crossing the 100 day ma has also occurred it will look better if the 50 day crosses the 200 day but the golden cross does get many excited especially talking heads wti oil remains in a nice uptrend and there is no sign of any topping action pullbacks are shallow the expectation is that wti oil should continue higher still it has a way to go to suggest to us that new highs will be made that point is 68 75 above that level and especially above 70 new highs are highly probable energy stocks have been slow to respond but this past week the xoi and the tsx energy index ten both showed signs of life especially on friday when the ten rose 2 9 and the xoi was up 2 1 both remain below their 200 day ma but are finding support above the 100 day ma in both instances the golden cross of the 50 day crossing the 100 day has been made thus suggesting bullish momentum chart of the week source www shadowstats com the u s reported that march s nonfarm payrolls rose 196 000 that was substantially above the revised 33 000 reported in february the unemployment rate remains at lows not seen since the late 1990s currently 3 8 u3 a reminder however that the labour force participation rate is sharply below the levels seen in the late 1990s that ratio peaked at over 67 in 1999 2000 today it sits at 63 if it were at 67 today the unemployment rate would be sharply higher one of the oddities of the nonfarm payrolls is that when one looks at other numbers things don t really make a lot of sense the total civilian labour force actually fell in march from february by 224 000 yet somehow they created 196 000 jobs even as the labour force fell full time employment fell 190 000 but part time employment jumped 60 000 those holding multiple jobs jumped 212 000 some of this has to do with the way things are counted as we have noted before there is the household survey and the payroll survey the household survey asks people if they are employed the payroll survey counts the number of jobs those working two jobs are counted as 2 in the payroll survey but only 1 in the household survey the total of people not in the labour force rose 369 000 in march from february for a total of 95 577 000 of that total 53 283 thousand are retirees while another 10 137 thousand are disabled of those not in the labour force there are 5 227 thousand that want a job but are no longer counted as a part of the labour force not surprisingly the shadow stats www shadowstats com unemployment rate remains elevated at 21 2 unchanged from february shadow stats unemployment number contains those workers defined out of the labour force back in 1994 they are workers unemployed for longer than one year the bureau of labour statistics bls highest unemployment is what is known as u6 which stands at 7 34 up slightly from february s 7 27 despite the appearance of at least a somewhat robust employment market there is no particularly strong wage growth average hourly earnings rose 3 2 year over year that was actually down from the previous month s 3 4 gain the gain in march of 0 1 was below the expected 0 3 gain year to year jobs growth sits at 1 7 the slowest pace since mid 2018 all this leads us to conclude that while things appear good there is considerable stress in the labour market otherwise why would the labour force be shrinking and the number of people holding multiple jobs be rising however many will tout this report as evidence that the u s continues to enjoy a strong expansion now into its 9th year one of the longest on record since 2010 21 million jobs have been created and unemployment has plunged from 10 but then no expansion in history has had the benefits of unprecedented quantitative easing qe historically low interest rates and more recently massive tax cuts and helping the unemployment rate along has been a drop in the participation in the labour force in 2010 the labour force participation rate was around 65 today it is 63 as we noted before if the participation rate was where it was in 2010 the unemployment rate would be quite a bit higher the question should be why have so many dropped out and where did they go did they all retire after all the number of retirees has jumped almost 20 since 2010 source www dshort com above is a chart of the unemployment rate u3 divided by the labour force participation rate we believe that is better reflection of the real rate of unemployment this series is not to be confused with the bls s u6 unemployment rate which stands at 7 3 the u6 is the u3 plus marginally attached workers and total employed part time for economic reasons but preferring full time employment nonetheless the above chart is interesting because the current level is at levels just before the start of recessions no that does not in itself signal a recession but is another sign that we are closer to one than we are away from one still that could be months away copyright david chapman 2019 technical scoop charts

published monday 8 april 2019 print disqus by ed steer yesterday in gold silver platinum and palladium the gold price didn t do much during the first two hours of trading once it began at 6 00 p m edt on thursday evening in new york but then the price pressure began and that sell off lasted until a few minutes after 12 o clock noon in shanghai on their friday except for a rather violent down up move at 8 30 a m in new york when the job numbers came out it crawled unevenly higher until a few minutes before the 11 a m edt london close at that juncture the price was held firm at thursday s closing price and moved quietly sideways from there until trading ended at 5 00 p m edt the high and low ticks certainly aren t worth looking up gold was closed in new york on friday afternoon at 1 291 40 spot down 50 cents on the day net volume was somewhat elevated at a bit under 225 000 contracts and there was a hair over 7 000 contracts worth of roll over switch volume in this precious metal the silver price started off the same as gold s complete with its noon cst low in far east trading and it rallied very unevenly from there until it poked its nose above the 15 20 spot mark shortly after 11 30 a m in london then it had a bit of a wild ride from there but ever lower in price and that lasted until a few minutes after the 1 30 p m edt close in new york and it traded flat for the remainder of the day but despite that wild ride the high and low ticks really aren t worth looking up silver was closed at 15 08 spot down 5 5 cents on the day and a penny below its 200 day moving average net volume was nothing out of the ordinary at 51 600 contracts and there was a bit over 16 600 contracts worth of roll over switch volume on top of that platinum followed a very similar price path as both gold and silver up until shortly after 12 o clock noon in shanghai from there it rallied quietly and without interference until shortly before 11 a m in zurich trading and back above 900 spot by a bit from there the price path was very unsteadily downwards until very shortly before the zurich close it then rallied a handful of dollars going into the comex close and didn t do a thing after that platinum was closed at 897 spot up 1 whole dollar the palladium price wandered unevenly sideways until 10 a m in zurich and then was sold down to its low of the day an hour and small change later it rallied from there until a few minutes before noon in new york and then edged very quietly lower into the 5 00 p m edt close palladium finished higher by 4 dollars at 1 351 spot the dollar index closed very late on thursday afternoon in new york at 97 31 and opened about unchanged once trading began at 7 44 p m edt on thursday evening it then chopped quietly sideways until about 11 55 a m china standard time on their friday morning and began to edge lower from there the 97 19 low tick of the day was set at 2 36 p m cst which was twenty four minutes before the london open it chopped very unevenly higher from there with the 97 47 high tick coming at 11 18 a m in new york and it faded a bit into the 5 30 p m edt close the dollar index finished the friday session at 97 40 up 9 basis points from its close on thursday here s the dxy chart courtesy of the folks over at bloomberg click to enlarge and here s the 6 month u s dollar index chart courtesy of stockcharts com and the delta between its close 96 49 and the close on the dxy chart above was 91 basis points yesterday click to enlarge as well the gold shares opened down a bit and hit their respective lows at 10 a m edt in new york which was the afternoon gold fix in london from that juncture they edged unsteadily higher for the remainder of the friday session and the hui closed down 0 37 percent the silver equities also opened down but began to recover within about ten minutes or so and actually made it into positive territory by a few minutes after 11 a m in new york trading those tiny gains didn t last as they silver stocks were sold quietly and unevenly lower until the markets closed at 4 00 p m edt nick laird s intraday silver sentiment silver 7 index closed down 0 38 percent click to enlarge if necessary and here s the 1 year silver sentiment silver 7 index chart from nick as well updated with friday s doji click to enlarge here are the usual charts from nick that show what s been happening for the week month to date and year to date the first one shows the changes in gold silver platinum and palladium for the past trading week in both percent and dollar and cents terms as of their friday closes in new york along with the changes in the hui and the silver 7 index here s the weekly chart and except for the ongoing rally in platinum there wasn t much change in anything either up or down click to enlarge since the month to date chart and the weekly chart are the same for this week i won t bother with it the year to date chart and with the exception of silver everything shows green across the board the silver 7 shows up only 1 50 percent but my booking keeping shows that it should read 2 95 percent nick and i are having a discussion about this very thing as i code today s column on wordpress click to enlarge i suspect that we ve seen the bottom for this move down but there are absolutely no guarantees about anything these days ted is of the firm opinion that jpmorgan is no longer short either gold or silver in the comex futures market if that s the case they may no longer hold short positions in the other two precious metals in the comex futures market either all we can is wait some more and see what happens the cme daily delivery report showed that 87 gold and 60 silver contracts were posted for delivery within the comex approved depositories on tuesday in gold the two largest short issuers of the five in total were morgan stanley with 45 contracts out of its own account and advantage with 32 contracts from its client account there were six long stoppers in total citigroup and hsbc usa picked up 26 and 20 contract for their respective in house proprietary trading accounts and advantage and jpmorgan picked up 22 and 16 contracts for their respective client accounts in silver the sole short issuer was international f c stone out of its client account and of the three long stoppers in total the two largest by far were jpmorgan and morgan stanley with 48 and 10 contracts for their respective client accounts issuers and stoppers report is the link to yesterday sis here the cme preliminary report for the friday trading session showed that gold open interest in april declined by 33 contracts leaving 443 left minus the 87 mentioned a few short paragraphs ago thursday s daily delivery report showed that 105 gold contracts were actually posted for delivery today so that means that 105 33 72 more gold contracts were just added to the april delivery month silver o i in april rose by 10 contracts leaving 120 still open minus the 60 contracts mentioned a few paragraphs ago thursday s daily delivery report showed that zero silver contracts were posted for delivery on monday so that means that 10 more silver contracts just got added to april so far this month there have been 4 115 gold contracts issued reissued and stopped and that number in silver is 757 for the fifth day in a row there was a withdrawal from gld as an authorized participant removed 28 330 troy ounces there were no reported changes in slv during the first week of april there was 726 319 troy ounces 22 6 metric tonnes of gold taken out of gld there was another tiny sales report from the u s mint on friday they sold 1 000 troy ounces of gold eagles 1 000 one ounce 24k gold buffaloes 500 one ounce platinum eagles and 10 500 silver eagles month to date the mint has sold 3 000 troy ounces of gold eagles 3 000 one ounce 24k gold buffaloes 1 100 one ounce platinum eagles and 550 000 silver eagles and still no q4 or 2018 financial statements from the royal canadian mint there was no physical movement in gold over at the comex approved depositories on the u s east coast on thursday but there were paper transfers from the eligible to the registered category 46 615 troy ounces of that amount there was 31 907 troy ounces transferred at canada s scotiabank and the remaining 14 708 troy ounces occurred at hsbc usa this is probably destined for delivery in april i won t bother linking this silver as one truckload 598 468 troy ounces was received that ended up at jpmorgan there was 635 077 troy ounces shipped out of that amount one truckload 600 256 troy ounces departed canada s scotiabank and the remaining amount was split up between delaware and cnt if you want to see those numbers for yourself the link to all this is there was some activity in as one truckload 598 468 troy ounces was received that ended up at jpmorgan there was 635 077 troy ounces shipped out of that amount one truckload 600 256 troy ounces departed canada s scotiabank and the remaining amount was split up between delaware and cnt if you want to see those numbers for yourself the link to all this is here there was a bit of activity over at the comex approved gold kilobar depositories in hong kong on their thursday they received only 30 of them and shipped out 169 all of this activity was at brink s inc as per usual and i won t bother linking this either the treasure of kul oba meaning hill of ash in crimean tatar is an ancient archaeological site a scythian burial tumulus located near kerch in eastern crimea on the right side of the m25 road to feodosiya kul oba was the first scythian royal barrow to be excavated in modern times uncovered in 1830 the stone tomb yielded a wealth of precious artifacts which drew considerable public interest to scythian world of particular interest is an intricately granulated earring with two nike figurines now in the hermitage museum st petersburg the tomb was built around 400 to 350 b c likely by a team of greek masons from panticapaeum its plan is almost square measuring 4 6 by 4 2 meters 15 by 14 ft the stepped vault stands 5 3 meters 17 ft high the timber ceiling seems to have been designed to imitate a scythian wooden tent it is decorated by a canopy with gold plaques the body of the king lay by the east wall on a sumptuous wooden couch his social position was highlighted by a diadem encircling his head surmounted by a pointed felt headgear with gold pendants his neck was decorated by a large gold disk weighing 461 grams each wrist was adorned with one to three bracelets a separate section of the couch contained other grave goods including a phial a whip a knife and a quiver all inlaid with gold or precious stones click to enlarge the commitment of traders report for positions held at the close of comex trading on tuesday april 2 showed big improvements in the commercial net short positions in both gold and silver but not quite as much as ted was hoping for particularly in gold in silver the commercial net short position in silver fell by 12 358 comex contracts or 61 8 million troy ounces they arrived at that number by adding 1 657 long contracts and they reduced their short position by 10 701 contracts the sum of those two numbers represents their change for the reporting week under the hood in the disaggregated cot report it was all managed money traders plus a bit more they only reduced their long position by 374 contracts but they added 13 656 short contracts and it s the sum of those two numbers 14 030 contracts that represents their change for the reporting week i m sort of wondering why the only reduced their long position by that amount and ted may have something to say about it in his weekly commentary this afternoon the difference between that number and the commercial net short position 14 030 minus 12 358 equals only 1 672 contracts that difference was made up as it always is by the traders in the other two categories the other reportables and the nonreportable small traders but both went about it in a very different manners the former by increasing their net long position by 4 136 contracts and the latter by increasing their short position by 2 464 contracts here s the snip from the disaggregated report so you can see these changes for yourself click to enlarge the commercial net short position in silver is now down to 34 358 comex contracts or 171 8 million troy ounces which is still not exactly in bullish territory and as ted mentioned in his saturday column a week ago it s his opinion that jpmorgan s short position which he pegged at around 10 000 contracts in last week s cot report has now been reduced to zero you can read much more about the current innards of the silver market in the days to cover commentary a bit further down here s the 3 year cot chart for silver and this week s change should be noted click to enlarge if one could see the cot report as of friday s close i suspect that there would be a bit more improvement in the commercial net short position as da boyz carved out two new intraday lows since the tuesday afternoon cut off in gold the commercial net short position fell by a hefty 33 204 contracts or 3 32 million troy ounces of paper gold ted was hoping for 60 000 contracts but his estimate in gold like for silver was thrown off by spread trade liquidation as the april delivery month approached they arrived at that number by selling 21 687 long contracts but they also reduced their short position by a chunky 54 891 contracts and it s the difference between those two numbers that represents their change for the reporting week under the hood in the disaggregated cot report it was all managed money traders and almost to the contract they reduced their long position by 24 557 contracts plus they added 8 812 short contracts and it s the sum of those two numbers 33 369 contracts that represents their change for the reporting week the difference between that number 33 369 minus 33 204 equals only 165 contracts but like in silver the other reportables and the nonreportable small traders went about it in wildly different fashions the former increased their net long position by 7 987 contracts and the latter by reducing their net long position by 7 822 contracts here s the snip from the disaggregated cot report for gold showing these changes so you can see them for yourself click to enlarge the commercial net short position in gold is now down to 11 82 million troy ounces ted is of the opinion that jpmorgan had no short position in gold going into this reporting week and might actually be long gold by a bit in the comex futures market now here s the 3 year cot chart for gold updated with this week s data click to enlarge as for silver if we could see a cot report as of the close of comex trading on friday there would certainly be a bit more improvement in the commercial net short position in gold in the other metals it wasn t business as usual in palladium this past week as volume blew out about nine times what it was last week as the managed money traders reduced their net long position by 2 122 contracts and it was almost all commercial traders reducing their net short position total open interest in palladium dropped down to 23 841 down 3 744 contracts from the previous week it s a very tiny market in platinum the managed money traders stood pat during the reporting week all the trading was in the other two categories the managed money traders are still net long the market by about 10 100 contracts total open interest in this precious metal is 68 064 contracts down 4 009 contracts from last week s report in copper the managed money traders increased their net long position by 5 105 comex contracts and are now only net short the comex futures market in copper by around 3 500 contracts here s nick laird s days to cover chart updated with yesterday s cot data for positions held at the close of comex trading this past tuesday it shows the days of world production that it would take to cover the short positions of the big 4 and big 5 through 8 traders in each physically traded commodity on the comex click to enlarge for the current reporting week the big 4 traders are short 110 days of world silver production which is down 12 days from last week s report and the 5 through 8 large traders are short an additional 60 days of world silver production down 1 day from last week s report for a total of 170 days that the big 8 are short which is a bit under 6 months of world silver production or about 396 8 million troy ounces of paper silver held short by the big 8 in the cot report above the commercial net short position in silver was reported as 171 8 million troy ounces as mentioned in the previous paragraph the short position of the big 8 traders is 396 8 million troy ounces the short position of the big 8 traders is larger than the total commercial net short position by a chunky 396 8 minus 171 8 equals 225 0 million troy ounces the reason for the difference in those numbers as it always is is that ted s raptors the 33 odd small commercial traders other than the big 8 are net long that amount jpmorgan has no short position in the comex futures market and the big 4 traders now in that category are short on average about 110 divided by 4 equals 27 5 days of world silver production each the four traders in the 5 through 8 category are short 60 days of world silver production in total which is 15 days of world silver production each the big 8 commercial traders are short 39 7 percent of the entire open interest in silver in the comex futures market down significantly from the 44 3 percent they were short in last week s report and once whatever market neutral spread trades are subtracted out that percentage would be very close to the 45 percent mark in gold it s now 37 7 percent of the total comex open interest that the big 8 are short up a tiny amount from the 36 9 percent they were short in last week s report and something over 40 percent once the market neutral spread trades are subtracted out in gold the big 4 are short 38 days of world gold production down 7 days from the 45 days they were short in last week s cot report the 5 through 8 are short another 20 days of world production unchanged from what they were short last week for a total of 58 days of world gold production held short by the big 8 down 7 days from last week s cot report based on these numbers the big 4 in gold hold about 66 percent of the total short position held by the big 8 down 3 percentage points from last week s cot report the concentrated short position within a concentrated short position in silver platinum and palladium held by the big 4 commercial traders are about 65 69 and 79 percent respectively of the short positions held by the big 8 silver is down 2 percentage point from a week ago platinum is unchanged from last week and palladium is up 2 percentage points the april bank participation report data is extracted directly from the data in yesterday s commitment of traders report it shows the number of futures contracts both long and short that are held by all the u s and non u s banks as of tuesday s cut off in all comex traded products for this one day a month we get to see what the world s banks are up to in the precious metals and they re usually up to quite a bit the april bank participation report covers all of march in gold 5 u s banks were net short 45 742 comex contracts in the april bpr in march s bank participation report these same 5 u s banks were net short 61 228 contracts so there was a big drop of 15 476 contracts from a month ago ted said on the phone yesterday that jpmorgan has most likely eliminated their entire short position in gold over the last two month also in gold 28 non u s banks are net short 57 734 comex gold contracts which is a bit over two thousand contracts per bank in the march s bpr 29 non u s banks were net short 54 200 comex contracts so the month over month increase is up a bit 3 534 contracts however as i always say at this point i suspect that there s at least two large non u s bank in this group including scotiabank that holds a fairly hefty short position in gold at the low back in the august bpr these same non u s banks held a net short position in gold of only 1 960 contacts and have continued to increase their net short position every single month for the last six month as they now are short 57 734 comex contracts that s a big increase as of this bank participation report 33 banks are net short 23 5 percent of the entire open interest in gold in the comex futures market which is down a bit from the 24 5 percent they were short in the march bpr here s nick s chart of the bank participation report for gold going back to 2000 charts 4 and 5 are the key ones here note the blow out in the short positions of the non u s banks when scotiabank s comex short position was outed by the cftc in october of 2012 click to enlarge in silver 4 u s banks are net short 20 016 comex silver contracts in april s bpr in march s bpr the net short position of 5 u s banks was 31 643 contracts so the short position of the u s banks is down a substantial 11 627 contracts from march bpr since ted figures that jpmorgan is not short any of that amount then it s pretty obvious that citigroup now holds the lion s share of the remaining short position of these four u s banks and hsbc usa the rest also in silver 24 non u s banks are net short 27 626 comex contracts which is down a bit from the 29 118 contracts that these same non u s banks were short in the march bpr i would suspect that canada s scotiabank still holds a goodly chunk of the short position of these non u s banks i believe that a number of the remaining 22 non u s banks are actually net long the comex futures market in silver but even if they aren t the remaining short positions divided up between these other 22 non u s banks are immaterial and have always been so as of april s bank participation report 28 banks are net short 23 9 percent of the entire open interest in the comex futures market in silver which is down quite a bit from the 31 9 percent that they were net short in the march bpr with much much more than the lion s share of that held by citigroup scotiabank and maybe one other non u s bank here s the bpr chart for silver note in chart 4 the blow out in the non u s bank short position in october of 2012 when scotiabank was brought in from the cold also note august 2008 when jpmorgan took over the silver short position of bear stearns the red bars it s very noticeable in chart 4 and really stands out like the proverbial sore thumb it is in chart 5 click to enlarge in platinum 5 u s banks are net short 10 710 comex contracts in the april bank participation report in the march bpr these same banks were net short 11 866 comex contracts so there s been a slight decrease of 1 156 contracts month over month that s quite a change for the worst since then also in platinum 15 non u s banks are net short 10 069 comex contracts which is up a bit from the 9 392 comex contracts they were net short in the march bpr and as of april s bank participation report 20 banks are net short 30 5 percent of platinum s total open interest in the comex futures market which is up a bit from the 27 4 percent they were net short in march s bpr here s the bank participation report chart for platinum click to enlarge in palladium 3 or less u s banks were net short 6 389 comex contracts in the april bpr which is down from the 7 964 contracts they held net short in the march bpr also in palladium 12 or more non u s banks are net short 885 comex contracts which is down from the 1 005 comex contracts that these same 12 or less non u s banks were short in the march bpr that s the lowest short position that the non u s banks have held since june 2016 when you divide up the short positions of these non u s banks more or less equally they re completely immaterial especially when you compare them to the positions held by the 3 or less u s banks as of this bank participation report 15 banks are net short 30 5 percent of the entire comex open interest in palladium in march s bpr the world s banks were net short 33 9 percent of total open interest so there s been a bit of a decrease in the short position of the banks in this precious metal over the last month please remember that this is a very tiny market and it doesn t take too many contracts to move it here s the palladium bpr chart you should note that the u s banks were almost nowhere to be seen in the comex futures market in this metal until the middle of 2007 and they became the predominant and controlling factor by the end of q1 of 2013 click to enlarge so with jpmorgan out of their short positions in both silver and gold and maybe the other two precious metals as well they ve left the rest of the world s banks in some peril if precious metal prices are allowed to rise and it should be mentioned that along with jpmorgan being free and clear in the comex futures market in silver and gold ted figures they re sitting on 20 million ounces of physical gold plus around 850 million troy ounces of silver as well i have an average number of stories for you today including a few that i ve been saving for my saturday column for length and or content reasons and some if it s pretty heavy duty reading critical reads expectations that the february cold weather outlier print would normalize in march were confirmed when moments ago the bls reported that the u s added 196k payrolls in march higher than the 177k expected while february payrolls were revised modestly higher to 33k from 20k the change in total non farm payroll employment for january was revised up from 311 000 to 312 000 and the change for february was revised up from 20 000 to 33 000 with these revisions employment gains in january and february combined were 14 000 more than previously reported employment growth averaged 180 000 per month in the first quarter of 2019 compared with 223 000 per month in 2018 as we previewed earlier winter weather was said to lower job growth in february by around 100k much of which itself reflected payback from the relatively mild weather in december and january commenting on the march report bloomberg s economist wliza winger writes that the march rebound in payrolls is consistent with previous episodes that followed much weaker than expected prints since the unemployment rate fell below 7 in late 2013 there have been five instances not counting last month in which the hiring rate dipped below 100 000 the average payroll print in the following month was 250 000 and there was only one instance where it was below 200 000 while the headline payrolls report coming in better than expected and snapping back from february s cold weather there was some unexpected weakness in manufacturing jobs which dipped by 6k in march their first drop since july 2017 zero hedge website at 8 52 a m on friday morning edt and it s the first of several

billion increase in january and bringing the non revolving total also to a new all time high of 2 984 trillion and while february s continued rebound in credit card use may assuage some concerns about

floodgates to turn the world s largest economy into a rocket ship i personally think the fed should drop rates i think they really slowed us down there s no inflation i would say in terms of quantitative tightening it should actually now be quantitative easing he told reporters as he departed the white house on friday you would see a rocket ship despite that we re doing very well the request for fed assistance to boost growth came just after a labor department report showed another healthy sign for the durability of an expansion that may become the longest on record by midyear the jobless rate held near a 49 year low and employers added more workers than economists forecast in march the report showed little sign of wage inflation trump is breaking with longstanding republican criticism of the fed s large balance sheet and embracing a loose monetary policy that in effect helps finance the nation s debt load he repeatedly criticized the fed under president barack obama for

the lowest since december 2013 since the beginning of the balance sheet normalization process the fed has shed 535 billion since peak balance sheet in january 2015 it has shed 581 billion last month the fed outlined its new plan for its balance sheet the autopilot of the balance sheet runoff will be tweaked starting in may a totally new regime will start in october there are all kinds of changes in this new plan primarily that the runoff of treasury securities will stop at the end of the september and that the fed wants to entirely get rid of its mortgage backed securities mbs including by selling them outright to replace them with shorter dated treasury securities this strategy will finally begin to address a massive maturity sinkhole that the fed has carved out for itself and slipped into ever deeper more on that in a moment according to the fed s old plan which is still in effect the qe unwind autopilot is set on shedding up to 30 billion in treasuries and up to 20 billion in mbs

sovereignty means sovereignty and estonia does not have to ask for russian permission to receive american military assistance now they repeated this american sermon verbatim to john bolton and his

the united states was mutual or at least would be returned one day however this stage is over the scales fell off their eyes and they finally realised america s implacable enmity these russians are

what might happen under a no deal brexit the chancellor of germany has pledged prevent no deal to the very last hour but she is still curious in a prudent practical sort of way about the european union s new external border with a non member state britain in the event of a hard brexit indeed her reasonable questions could also be posed about the border between northern ireland the u k and ireland the e u after the transition period that is if a withdrawal agreement is ever ratified when the transition period runs out and if there are no other technological solutions to the problem then the u k and e u will have to share a customs union indefinitely something that one or other or both sides might find intolerable eventually if so then the question of the border will arise once again

round of the presidential election in the ukraine took place on april fool s day and it could be tempting to dismiss it all like a big farce which of course it was but we should not overlook the fact that some very interesting and important events have just taken place i won t discuss them all right now there will be plenty of time for that in the future for now i will only focus on those elements of a much bigger picture which seem most critical to me these elements are by nazis i primarily mean their main figurehead petro poroshenko the rest of the minor nazis did so poorly that they don t matter anymore think of it in spite of his immense wealth he outspent everybody else and even spent more that twice what the next big spender tymoshenko doled out for each vote in spite of his immense administrative resource that is the russian expression for the ability to use the power of the state for your personal benefit in spite of his victory with the tomos in spite of triggering the kerch bridge incident in spite of breaking all the remaining treaties with russia in spite of his control of the media and in spite of the now admittedly lukewarm support of the west poroshenko suffered a crushing defeat look at the only two regions petro poroshenko i e the nazis actually won in blue and see how nicely they overlap with the rough historical contours of the galicia region but poroshenko managed to even lose part of that to iulia tymoshenko bottom line except for a minority of rabid hardcore nazis in galicia the rest of the ukraine hates the poroshenko ukronazi regime we always knew

though best to leave for today s column i thank larry galearis for sending it along and another link to it is here in recent years thanks to central bank intervention in virtually every asset class writing about capital markets in the context of some valuation or fundamental analysis framework has become a laughable surreal and self defeating exercise and here is a perfect example why for one reason or another overseas investors dumped the most japanese stocks in 31 years in the fiscal year ended sunday according to official market data specifically market participants abroad unloaded about 5 63 trillion yen 50 billion worth of shares on a net basis the tokyo stock exchange reported thursday for a second straight year of net selling and the highest sell off since 1987 and yet this barely caused a ripple in asset prices for one simple reason the bank of japan s asset purchases absorbed all the bleeding exposing the central bank s outsize role in the market indeed as the nikkei adds this near record liquidation was matched nearly yen for yen by the boj s pumping of money into the economy through asset purchases with the central bank buying 5 65 trillion yen worth of equity in light of such prevailing bearishness among foreign investors one would think the nikkei got clobbered and yet the broadest japanese index is now above where it was this time last year why because in its attempt to preserve confidence and avoid what could be a potentially devastating asset selloff in a world in which stock markets are the leading indicators for regional and global economies the boj stepped up its purchases of japanese stocks through etfs a first among central banks the program began in 2010 when the nikkei stock average was trading below 10 000 points the central bank s stated objective then was to lower the risk premium and the purchasing volume stood at 450 billion yen while perhaps not nearly as dramatic the boj s now constant intervention and participation in capital markets means that any feedback loops between assets prices and input signals is now forever lost and means that management teams no longer can appreciate if any given executive decision is ultimately good or bad as the market s ability to reward and punish has been muted at least until the boj loses control and as such every corporate decision no matter how disastrous for the company its employees shareholders and peer companies is seen as beneficial yet it most likely merely masks the seeds of the enterprise s own demise and while global capital markets are now delighted by the recent u turn in monetary tightening it just makes the eventual moment of reckoning that much more painful which is why for all those who are currently allocating capital to what can only be called a market in some comical context our advice is simple have an exit plan for precisely that moment when exiting will be made illegal and ludwig von mises will be proven right once again longish but

gross international reserves gir to 500bn in the latest statements the bank said it is necessary to increase fx and gold reserves even more from the current highs given the persisting sanction risks and current economic structure deputy head of the cbr sergey shvetsov told the press on april 3 the volume of fx gold reserves reached 487bn as of march 22 bring reserves back to the same level they were before the sanctions regime started following russia s annexation of the crimea in 2014 increasing by 4 6bn week on week on positive currency revaluation and fx purchases off the market however shvetsov did not provide any guidance on the target amount of reserves saying that it was better to wait for quarterly or annual reports of the cbr however separately cbr governor elvira nabiullina has said in the past the cbr has an informal goal to get reserves back above 500bn russia s reserves reached an all time high of 597 5 billion on august 8 2008 just before the global financial

the global monetary system the first is the creation of the international monetary fund at the bretton woods conference 75 years ago the second is the advent 50 years ago of the special drawing right sdr the imf s global reserve asset when it introduced the sdr the fund hoped to make it the principal reserve asset in the international monetary system this remains an unfulfilled ambition indeed the sdr is one of the most underused instruments of international cooperation nonetheless better late than never turning the sdr into a true global currency would yield several benefits for the world s economy and monetary system the sdr has a number of basic advantages not least that the imf can use it as an instrument of international monetary policy in a global economic crisis in 2009 for example the imf issued 250 billion in sdrs to help combat the downturn following a proposal by the g20 the best alternative would be to turn the imf into an institution fully financed and managed in its own global currency a proposal made several decades ago by jacques polak then the fund s leading economist one simple option would be to consider the sdrs that countries hold but have not used as deposits at the imf which the fund can use to finance its lending to countries this would require a change in the articles of agreement because sdrs currently are not held in regular imf accounts extremely

what various assets are worth for almost 20 years my organization the gold anti trust action committee has documented why mining assets particularly and other assets generally can not be valued accurately or even valued at all without first taking into account the largely surreptitious intervention in the markets by governments and central banks surreptitious intervention that lately has become almost comprehensive government intervention against the price of gold is not mere conspiracy theory but an old story fully documented in government s own archives it is official policy going back to the united states government s enactment of the gold reserve act of 1934 which created the u s government s exchange stabilization fund this policy of gold price suppression continued through the london gold pool of the 1960s a coordinated scheme of gold reserve dishoarding by the u s government and seven allied governments to hold the international gold price at 35 per ounce the objective of these interventions always has been to defend government currencies and bonds against competition from gold as a currency and store of value but by the early 1970s the governments participating in gold price suppression had lost too much of their gold reserves to continue suppressing the gold price by dishoarding in the open so they began operating against gold mostly in secret through gold leasing swapping and futures market manipulation usually shorting the futures through the large investment banks that trade the monetary metals and execute other market interventions for governments

one of my college professors used an agrarian example to describe different economic regimes in a capitalist system he said you start with two cows you sell one and buy a bull to help grow your business in a socialist system you start with two cows the state takes one of them and gives it to your neighbor in a communist system you start with two cows the state takes them both and gives you some of the milk they produce the past generation has seen a pronounced drift away from the latter two models forty years ago deng xiaoping began an economic liberalization in china that laid the foundation for the country s emergence as a global power thirty years ago the berlin wall was opened to passage thirty years ago signaling the failure of the european communist bloc the subsequent ascent of global capitalism has been evident in the trade and market liberalization that has created substantial wealth across countries in spite of these achievements we are hearing more about socialism these days candidates across the globe are espousing principles that had fallen into disrepute and finding broadening support as this movement gathers steam we should pause to consider what socialism is and isn t why it has gotten traction recently and the implications for the global economy the current expansion nearing its tenth birthday is remarkable for its humble beginnings at the depth of the financial crisis it wasn t clear whether normal economic function could be restored the world s central banks turned the tide with innovative creative policies the resulting turnaround was tremendous global gross domestic product gdp grew by 34 since 2009 and global equity markets are now 185 higher but outcomes have been uneven within and across countries the gap has expanded between those who have done well and those who haven t national income is divided between corporations and workers after recessions the proportion of profit share for companies typically rises as firms hold down costs to make up for lean times as time passes the wage share normally recovers that has not been the case during this cycle wages have moved ahead very slowly despite low levels of unemployment furthermore those below the upper quintiles have not benefitted much from the performance of the stock markets and some communities have endured significant economic displacement as globalization and automation take deeper root these factors have created a groundswell of discontent that has become a powerful political force the initial targets of the movement have been trade and immigration which have both been curtailed over the past several years the evidence suggests these steps do more harm than good to an economy and its workers but viscerally the appeal of closing borders has increased some want to take the effort further they see the current system as tilted and in need of leveling proposals to expand social benefits and pay for them with higher taxes are on the table in a number of countries these efforts have been branded by some as progressive and by others as the new socialism to be sure some socialism is already embedded in even the most capitalist of systems most countries have public schools public assistance and at least some public health care you may be surprised to learn that medicare and medicaid now serve 40 of the united states population countries differ not on whether government is active in the economy but the degree to which the public sector is involved in many countries there are calls to expand social supports increased subsidies for education more public health care and improved worker benefits have all been proposed these would be financed with higher tax rates which have generally been falling over the last 40 years defenders of the current regime observe that lower taxes have provided incentives for economies to grow which benefits everyone they claim that changing those incentives would result in less innovation fewer small business formations and capital flight from this perspective it is better to focus on baking the pie not slicing the pie with some intelligent and selective investments in education and infrastructure markets can be a vehicle for increased economic opportunity unfortunately strained public budgets in most of the world have made these strategies difficult to pursue progressives claim that many are getting crumbs while a few are gorging when these extremes have arisen in the past political and social stress has often followed the excesses of the gilded age at the beginning of the 20th century led to stricter labor laws trust busting and in some countries regime change it would be a stretch to say revolution is in the air workers of the world are not united in fact the decline of unions has been cited as a contributor to the recent skewing of economic outcomes and while progressive voices are rising they are not yet close to a majority nonetheless those voices will make it more difficult for parties on the right on the left and in the center to come up with cohesive platforms that satisfy all constituents and in some cases like amazon s retreat from new york they can win the day until policy produces the promise of additional economic equity progressives will continue to advance and that s no bull neither modern nor monetary many of today s

shares the acronym mmt with the disney devices it is no cartoon deus ex machina the stakes of modern monetary theory are high and its risks are many mmt s fundamental premise is that an economy issuing debt in its own currency has few limits on its capacity to borrow the country s central bank can always create more currency to purchase government bonds and pay interest government spending would be nearly unconstrained an mmt oriented economy would fundamentally alter the role of its central bank today central banks set monetary policy by steering interest rates with the goals of managing inflation and maximizing employment under mmt the legislature would take on these goals using its existing powers of spending and taxation with the central bank serving only to issue currency and purchase bonds costly programs like a jobs guarantee would become affordable under mmt and defensible by moving the employment mandate to the legislature the appeal is obvious removing the question of funding would allow politicians to implement popular but expensive ideas and the intuition is supported by recent experience over the past 50 years the united states has rarely balanced its budget thriving despite continual increases in the national debt meanwhile the fear that printing money causes inflation is contradicted by the muted inflation witnessed in the u s and europe after quantitative easing but the risks are high any rapid increase to the money supply runs the risk of sparking an inflation wildfire critics point to obvious examples of countries sealing their fates by printing money in a crisis weimar germany zimbabwe venezuela but these countries did not have reserve currencies and are poor analogues to today s developed economies experimenting with mmt would permanently alter a country s fiscal position as it stands debt to gdp ratios around the world are setting peacetime record highs a run up would lead to a level of debt that could never be paid down in an mmt world that is fine the public debt adds to a private surplus however should confidence in a reserve currency falter inflation and default would be inevitable an intervention such as the imf s support of the u k in 1976 would be unaffordable such a large restructuring would destabilize an entire economy to little surprise today s fed governors and economic advisers reject the premises of mmt despite its name mmt is not modern it is the latest iteration of the idea of monetizing the debt relying on a central bank to create demand for a country s bonds the bank of japan routinely buys all japanese government bonds on the open market keeping borrowing costs near zero despite a massive government debt japan has not imploded under this debt burden but it has stagnated government intervention reduced a crisis but did not unlock growth on a practical level the mmt debate is more political than economic mmt will be restrained by popular support for independent central banking and disciplined spending we view the discourse as an illustration of the more permissive attitude that policymakers have taken toward deficits and inflation it may also presage what economic strategy might look like during the next downturn as shown in the discussion of the green new deal policy debates have turned away from what we can afford and toward what we should seek to accomplish but there is no magic tool that allows us to spend without cease not even the sorcerer s apprentice can do that closing the poor house while income and wealth inequality are on the rise worldwide significant progress toward reducing poverty has been made over the past few decades globalization has helped bringing work and incomes to developing countries though this is laudable there is much work left to be done estimates from the world bank find that poverty has declined from 36 of the world population or 1 85 billion people in 1990 to 10 736 million in 2015 rapidly growing china home to 1 4 billion people has experienced the greatest poverty reduction over the past 25 years that said the pace of the global decline has slowed and poverty eradication remains a key challenge for some regions particularly sub saharan africa and south asia more than half over 400 million of the extreme poor are in sub saharan africa alone the middle east and north africa are the only major world regions where the poverty rate has risen since 2013 a period of stubbornly low oil prices despite being among the world s fastest growing economies a few major emerging markets such as india and south africa are still reeling with distressingly high poverty rates 21 273 million people and 19 respectively in india national poverty reduction programs have been largely aimed at making the conditions of poverty easier rather than fostering human capital to move out of poverty the recipe to fight poverty not only entails a high growth rate but also a sustainable and inclusive model of development led by increased participation from private sector expansion of education and social security nets along with investment in prevention systems against shocks like pandemics natural disasters conflicts and financial crisis are equally important measures much work remains to achieve the world bank s target of no more than 3 of the global populace living below the defined threshold by the year 2030 and the poverty line defined at 1 90 per person per day at 2011 purchasing power parity is a low bar the fight against poverty has yet to reach a logical conclusion we should be glad for the progress that has been made but we should also remain hungry for more

driven by foreign credit turkey has slipped into recession for the first time in a decade inflation is in double digits and economists are watching how turkish officials will manage its recovery on paper and in public speeches the economic leadership seems to agree reform is needed in practice the government s recent record is poor said maya senussi senior economist at oxford economics the authorities have to not only admit that mistakes were made over the past year but also signal a readiness to sacrifice growth in the short term to increase the chances of long term prosperity a decision the akp has so far been unwilling to make turkish officials have in the past talked up broad reforms including a tax overhaul and measures to strengthen growth but a major worry analysts say is foreign debt exposure for turkish companies which face more costly repayments for foreign lending because of the weaker lira we see this period as an opportunity to make permanent solutions for our structural problems rifat hisarciklioglu head of turkey s chambers and commodity exchanges union told a meeting of business leaders on friday anadolu state news agency said after a 2017 vote granting him broader powers as president erdogan is in a position to deliver reforms but sunday s election highlighted investor worries over how turkey can turn to short term fiscal expediency if required before sunday s vote the lira fell almost 6 percent in one day after investors worried the government tapped foreign reserves to prop up the currency in the lead up to the ballot and measures to halt lira short selling afterwards did not help investor confidence moody s rating agency warned lira intervention raised doubts about central bank independence and turkey s broader policy renewed turmoil in the turkish financial markets and heightened uncertainty regarding the policy reaction to the ongoing recession raise the risk of further capital flight it said turkish officials defend the central bank s independence but erdogan has demanded it lower interest rates which he blames for high inflation that worries investors who see political pressure on bank policymaking the turkish leader has also lashed out at foreign investment banks and blamed recent currency fluctuations on part of a us led attempt to corner turkey financially finance minister albayrak has to come up with a programme to convince markets and importantly locals that the current management team know what they are doing rebuilding credibility in the process said timothy ash a senior sovereign strategist at bluebay asset management overshadowing turkey s economic outlook will be erdogan s testy relations with the united states which are already frayed by disputes over syria turkey s russian missile purchases and its arrests of us diplomatic staff when a dispute erupted last year over turkey s detention of a us pastor washington swiftly imposed sanctions and tariffs on some turkish goods triggering the slide in the lira turkey s government has said it will go ahead with a purchase of russian s 400 missiles despite washington suspending ankara s participation in the us made f 35 fighter jet programme and warning of more sanctions to come
soon after his ruling party faced defeat in ankara and istanbul in last sunday s election turkish president recep tayyip erdogan was quick to promise reforms to revive the country s weakened economy stung by high living costs and a 2018 currency crisis voters handed the akp one of the party s worst setbacks after a decade and a half in power now with no elections until 2023 erdogan has room to focus on the economy but analysts say he must convince investors already wary over his sometimes unorthodox policies and worried about fallout from tensions with the united states turkey s lira can be volatile but analysts said erdogan s government must balance any gains from short term stopgaps with the need for deeper reforms for more long term stability finance minister berat albayrak also erdogan s son in law has said turkey will enter an economic rebalancing period after the elections and he is set to reveal reform details next week albayrak is due to meet imf and world bank officials in washington april 12 14 to shed light on the new road map for turkey s economy according to the daily sabah newspaper as concerns about the struggling economy motivated many voters decisions at the ballot box erdogan will be compelled to address its underlying problems said amanda sloat at the brookings institute however he has limited room for maneuver the akp built its success on turkey s strong growth and his supporters point to progress in living standards during erdogan s 16 years in office but on sunday the akp was punished in part because turkish households were stung last year by a 30 percent slide in the lira during a diplomatic crisis with the us once the darling of emerging market investors economists say turkey has lost some of its appeal as problems emerged with growth driven by foreign credit turkey has slipped into recession for the first time in a decade inflation is in double digits and economists are watching how turkish officials will manage its recovery on paper and in public speeches the economic leadership seems to agree reform is needed in practice the government s recent record is poor said maya senussi senior economist at oxford economics the authorities have to not only admit that mistakes were made over the past year but also signal a readiness to sacrifice growth in the short term to increase the chances of long term prosperity a decision the akp has so far been unwilling to make turkish officials have in the past talked up broad reforms including a tax overhaul and measures to strengthen growth but a major worry analysts say is foreign debt exposure for turkish companies which face more costly repayments for foreign lending because of the weaker lira we see this period as an opportunity to make permanent solutions for our structural problems rifat hisarciklioglu head of turkey s chambers and commodity exchanges union told a meeting of business leaders on friday anadolu state news agency said after a 2017 vote granting him broader powers as president erdogan is in a position to deliver reforms but sunday s election highlighted investor worries over how turkey can turn to short term fiscal expediency if required before sunday s vote the lira fell almost 6 percent in one day after investors worried the government tapped foreign reserves to prop up the currency in the lead up to the ballot and measures to halt lira short selling afterwards did not help investor confidence moody s rating agency warned lira intervention raised doubts about central bank independence and turkey s broader policy renewed turmoil in the turkish financial markets and heightened uncertainty regarding the policy reaction to the ongoing recession raise the risk of further capital flight it said turkish officials defend the central bank s independence but erdogan has demanded it lower interest rates which he blames for high inflation that worries investors who see political pressure on bank policymaking the turkish leader has also lashed out at foreign investment banks and blamed recent currency fluctuations on part of a us led attempt to corner turkey financially finance minister albayrak has to come up with a program to convince markets and importantly locals that the current management team know what they are doing rebuilding credibility in the process said timothy ash a senior sovereign strategist at bluebay asset management overshadowing turkey s economic outlook will be erdogan s testy relations with the united states which are already frayed by disputes over syria turkey s russian missile purchases and its arrests of us diplomatic staff

a false prospectus the fourth problem is the brexiteers themselves language has become ever shriller phrases such as vassal state empire and supplicant have entered the language even though they do not even remotely characterise our relation with europe the affection of some of them for donald trump is ominous it is not too late to think again our european neighbours have made it clear that we can reverse article 50 of course this would be a moment of national embarrassment more seriously it would quite reasonably be portrayed as a betrayal of the 17 4 million people who voted to leave europe in the referendum this is a huge powerful point and having thought about it deeply i would answer as follows the brexiteers made a succession of claims about leaving the eu that have turned out to be untrue they said it would be quick and easy they said that a raft of trade deals would be available by the time we left the eu to quote liam fox the free trade agreement that we will have to do with the european union should be one of the easiest in human history they made exaggerated and false claims about british finances after brexit they used illegal methods and their funding was obscure if the brexit referendum had been a general election the brexiteers would have been chucked out of office of course changing our approach after a year s mature reflection would need a second referendum but i don t believe it would be undemocratic a great deal of water has flowed under the bridge since january 2016 so many of the facts have changed that it makes every kind of sense to re examine the most important decision in decades finally and without naming them i must state that there are many mps and not a few journalists still marching under the brexit banner who will read this article with a sympathy and support they do not feel able to declare they too have changed their minds i have and must say so fair enough you may think but where is the ringing declaration of love for the european union we have seen the passionate beliefs of the brexiteers where s your own positivity where your matching passion for remain i have none only a deep gnawing worry that we are making a significant mistake a worry that is growing by the hour call that negative if you like but precaution is negative yet it is part of our kit for survival i come back then to a proposition that sounds lame as quiet good sense so often does just this and this alone suspending brexit will be greatly preferable to the alternative how many important decisions in our own lives too have had to be taken on such a chilly and unexciting consideration it s time for a long pause peter oborne writes here in his personal capacity update 24 september 2019 the national crime agency has found no evidence that arron banks elizabeth bilney better for the country ltd or leave eu committed a crime under electoral or company law its investigation related to a referral from the electoral commission on 1 november 2018 for more information see the nca statement here

above growth rate for the world economy trump cancelled several free trade deals he cancelled the nuclear arms control agreement with iran then he imposed sanctions on iran and ordered all european companies to comply the financial markets worldwide were roiled by these threats and tariffs the tariffs have caused consumer prices to rise in america and europe as major retailers passed their price

national home price growth slowed to 2 7 per cent year over year in the first quarter of 2019 home prices in western canada forecast to decline price growth in the greater toronto area gta remains steady supported by low inventory slowdown in greater vancouver driven by policy changes greater montreal area home price growth continues to outpace the gta and greater vancouver ottawa home prices inch ahead of calgary for the first time according to the royal lepage house price survey1 released today canada s residential real estate market showed slowing year over year price growth in the first quarter of 2019 early in 2018 canada experienced the most significant housing correction since the 2008 financial crisis markets showed signs of recovery late in the year yet the figures for early 2019 suggest that the market has once again slowed the royal lepage national house price composite compiled from proprietary property data in 63 of the nation s largest real estate markets showed that the price of a home in canada increased just 2 7 per cent year over year to 621 575 in the first quarter of 2019 well below the long term norm of approximately 5 per cent when broken out by housing type the median price of a two storey home rose 2 6 per cent year over year to 729 553 while the median price of a bungalow rose 1 1 per cent year over year to 513 497 condominiums remained the fastest growing housing type on a national basis rising 5 4 per cent year over year to 447 260 looking ahead to the second quarter royal lepage expects national home prices to stay relatively flat throughout the 2019 spring market with the national aggregate price of a home increasing 1 0 per cent over the next three months meanwhile the housing markets in several larger canadian cities have shown noticeable signs of slowing with nearly half of the regions in royal lepage s quarterly forecast2 anticipating quarter over quarter price declines notably royal lepage is expecting home prices in greater vancouver to fall 1 4 per cent over the next quarter ottawa is expected to post the highest price appreciation during the spring market and is forecast to rise 2 8 per cent to 482 459 during the second quarter we are expecting this to be a sluggish year overall in canada s residential real estate market with the hangover from the 2018 market correction and weaker economic growth acting as a drag on home price appreciation balanced by lower for longer interest rates said phil soper president and ceo royal lepage there is a silver lining here this slowdown gives buyers and first time buyers in particular an opportunity to buy real estate in our country s largest cities the global economy hit a soft spot entering the new year the economic downturns in china and germany ongoing trade disputes and slowing u s growth support a relatively muted global outlook the upside for the canadian housing market is the increased likelihood that interest rate hikes are on hold for the foreseeable future canada is certainly affected by negative global macroeconomic trends yet full time job creation in our country is very strong and full time employment turns renters into buyers said soper the medium term outlook for housing remains very positive in the federal budget tabled by finance minister bill morneau in march the canadian government announced three new or enhanced housing programs the first time home buyer incentive is a three year 1 25 billion shared equity mortgage program whereby the canadian housing and mortgage corporation cmhc will co invest up to five per cent of the purchase price of an existing home further for the first time in a decade there was an increase in the registered retirement savings plan withdrawal limits in the home buyers plan the increase from 25 000 to 35 000 was the largest since the program s inception in 1992 finally an additional 10 billion in financing over nine years was earmarked for the construction of purpose built rental housing like many government initiatives the new housing programs have supporters and critics said soper prospective home buyers and the hundreds of thousands of canadians who directly or indirectly earn their living from real estate activity should remember that there were many policy areas competing for attention in 2019 housing captured the attention and support of federal lawmakers which is a welcome and necessary development some critics believe that the narrowly focused federal housing initiatives will overstimulate already expensive markets we disagree eroding affordability risks taking the dream of homeownership away from young canadian families said soper without a healthy influx of first time buyers the entire cycle of real estate activity can stall there is the chance however that activity levels in the spring of 2019 will be reduced as some delay purchases waiting for the first time home buyer incentive to kick in driven by supply side shortages and augmented by an improving job market home price appreciation in ontario heavily influenced the national results in the first quarter of 2019 if ontario is excluded from the royal lepage national house price composite canadian price appreciation would sit at a modest 0 4 per cent increase compared to 2 7 per cent the city of toronto is still one of canada s fastest appreciating real estate markets said soper detached home prices are rising in line with inflation but condominium prices are increasing at near double digit levels as vertical living has become the primary new build option in this growing world class city median home prices in the city of toronto rose 5 8 per cent year over year in the first quarter of 2019 two storey home prices and bungalow home prices rose 4 8 per cent and 2 5 per cent year over year respectively while condo prices rose a weighty 9 3 per cent year over year the overall gta s aggregate home price rose 3 4 per cent over the same period real estate values in ontario s golden horseshoe region continued to appreciate at a brisk clip as local economies grew and workers from the gta looked to trade commuting time for lower house prices niagara st catharines hamilton and kitchener waterloo cambridge aggregate prices were up by 6 9 per cent 6 3 per cent and 8 9 per cent respectively in eastern ontario ottawa home prices appreciated by 7 7 per cent year over year one of the principal advanced technology regions in north america and home to much of the federal government s labour force household formation in the national capital region has been robust the aggregate price of a home in ottawa has now surpassed that of calgary for the first time a trend unforeseen five years ago other notable price increases for ontario cities include kingston at 10 3 per cent increase and in western ontario london and windsor both experienced double digit home price increases rising 10 7 per cent and 12 4 per cent year over year respectively while the overall provincial economy remains strong in british columbia its housing market remains vulnerable as government intervention continues to drive down real estate activity for the first time since 2012 greater vancouver home prices declined year over year with the aggregate price dipping 1 5 per cent for the first quarter of 2019 to 1 239 306 while overall listing volumes are increasing the greater vancouver area remains one of the most desirable places to live in the world population growth is driving household formation and employment levels high yet policy intervention has induced a drop in home sales to levels not seen in three decades soper said hammering consumer confidence and artificially choking off demand with a series of new taxes and restrictive regulations doesn t eliminate the need for new housing it simply sidelines families in the short term and fuels a disruptive boom bust cycle some of the most desirable regions in greater vancouver are seeing home price declines properties in the region s higher end markets like west vancouver north vancouver burnaby and the city of vancouver are all declining in price offering buyers seeking luxury housing a rare window of opportunity to enter some of canada s highest priced markets despite a recent rally in world oil prices activity levels in the canadian energy sector remain muted while it is unlikely that the province will enter a technical recession economic activity in alberta is forecast to remain sluggish the aggregate price of a home in calgary edmonton and fort mcmurray fell marginally by 1 5 per cent 1 0 per cent and 0 8 per cent to 468 974 371 782 and 576 211 respectively in the first quarter of 2019 the aggregate price of a home in the greater montreal area increased 5 5 per cent year over year to 406 332 the rate of home price appreciation in the greater montreal area once again surpassed rates seen in the gta 3 4 per cent greater vancouver 1 5 per cent and the national average 2 7 per cent all three reported housing types saw gains this quarter with median home prices for two storey homes bungalows and condominiums rising 6 4 per cent to 514 412 3 7 per cent to 316 159 and 5 2 per cent to 328 488 respectively economic activity in atlantic canada remains a mixed bag prince edward island is seeing solid economic growth but persistently high unemployment rates have resulted in an aggregate price increase for a charlottetown home of only 0 7 per cent year over year to 288 230 the demographics in nova scotia are favourable as the province is benefiting from higher immigration and interprovincial migration numbers and the region has a strong export sector the aggregate price for a home in halifax increased 1 6 per cent year over year to 318 733 meanwhile the outlook for new brunswick is mixed with forecasters anticipating gains from an improving commodity sector will offset a declining population and an 8 5 per cent unemployment rate in the first quarter the aggregate price of a home in saint john increased 1 9 per cent year over year to 213 290 while the aggregate price for a home in moncton decreased 1 3 per cent year over year to 192 185 similarly the economy in newfoundland and labrador is sending mixed signals as the current unemployment rate is 11 8 per cent but natural resource projects like the syndicate operated hebron project husky s white rose oil field and vale s voisey s bay nickel mine are all expected to ramp up production the aggregate price of a home in st john s decreased 5 6 per cent year over year to 324 955 read more about regional

if you take nate mcmurray at his word he often sounds a lot more like a conservative or even a populist than the progressive he sometimes claims to be he says for example that he s a capitalist he believes in an american work ethic he worries about deficit spending he s concerned about any increase in middle class taxes he decries over regulation of business he s a gun owner who says a homeowner has a right to use a firearm to defend himself and his household he lists ronald reagan as one of his childhood heroes on the populist side he says donald trump is right about some things he s right about unfair trade deals and he s right that much of america has been hurt by recent economic policies and that the system has become fundamentally unfair to working americans if mcmurray goes to washington he promises to be his own man he won t be beholden to nancy pelosi and he won t owe anything to any special interests i am not controlled by anybody especially not nancy pelosi mcmurray said monday night during a meeting with about 50 undecided voters at noblehurst farms in pavilion i have no relationship with her whatsoever i don t know anything about nancy pelosi i m going to go to washington and i m going to be an independent voice if nancy pelosi is right about something i m going to say that s right if she s wrong i m going to say that s wrong rise from underdog to legitimate challenger when nate mcmurray announced his intention to run for congress in new york s 27th district he wasn t even the favorite among the five others expected to vie for the seat once he emerged after a few weeks as the lone democrat still interested in running gov andrew cuomo tried putting pressure on lt gov kathy hochul to drop her bid for reelection and run against rep chris collins whom she lost to in 2012 hochul refused to switch races and has since endorsed mcmurray early on mcmurray adopted the hashtag on social media natewillwin but remained at best a long shot as july dragged into august even though ethics questions hung on collins like bright red lights on a christmas tree the gop said collins was their man his credentials included a first in congress endorsement of donald j trump in 2016 and a 1 4 million war chest loyalty to trump in the 27th runs deep the president s approval rating is 62 percent twenty points higher than the rest of the nation and collins has never wavered from his support for the sometimes embattled president the incumbent seemed invincible that all changed when the multimillionaire businessman was arrested aug 8 and charged with securities fraud wire fraud and lying to the fbi in connection with a series of stock trades his son cameron and others made in june 2017 after collins learned that a critical drug trial had failed for innate therapeutics collins is accused of illegally providing confidential information about the drug trial s failure to his son during a phone call collins placed from the lawn of the white house since then collins has said he was running for reelection then not running for reelection and then was back in the race in the intervening weeks he has largely avoided the public and reporters while dumping campaign funds into tv commercials that portray mcmurray as a pelosi backed extremist out to destroy the presidency destroy the economy and take away your guns none of that is true mcmurray told the crowd at monday night s meeting every independent news outlet that has looked into these things is saying the advertisements are false mcmurray said the fliers are false the advertisements are false if the stuff collins is saying is so true he would have the guts to stand on stage and say it to my face mcmurray has worked hard the criminal charges have hurt collins while trump supporters are steadfastly behind their man other members of the gop are expressing doubt and the race has tipped from a sure thing for collins to a toss up according to a recent siena poll contrasting backgrounds different messages mcmurray a barrel chested 6 3 former high school bodybuilder makes much of his working class background both to burnish his populist image though he said he never thought of himself as a populist until asked about it and to contrast his upbringing to that of collins mcmurray was born in tonawanda his father was a proud union member a painter and mcmurray said the chemicals in the paint at the time were more dangerous his father died of cancer at age 39 leaving his 35 year old wife to raise mcmurray and his six siblings on her own he said finances were a struggle he worked his way through erie county community college he studied hard and became a fulbright scholar and earned his law degree and passed the bar he s been a corporate attorney most of his adult life most recently with delaware north in buffalo he is currently the supervisor in the town of grand island collins in mcmurray s narrative grew up in privilege where mcmurray is a working class western new yorker collins is the son of a well to do business executive able to attend a four year university in north carolina where mcmurray made his own way collins benefitted from his family s wealth where mcmurray played by the rules collins thinks the rules don t apply to him if we win this seat we don t just win for western new york mcmurray said monday night we send a message to this entire country that a guy who started at a community college who worked every day worked his way through law school is able to beat maybe the richest and perhaps the most corrupt man in congress mcmurray also thinks his background and his attitudes especially his full throated support for capitalism and his support of second amendment rights puts him in conflict with the mainstream of the contemporary democratic party i do not want to run to impeach president trump mcmurray said during an interview with the batavian early this month at wbta s studio i don t support the safe act i mean there are things about me that most democrats when they hear me they cringe the reason why i m a democrat however is i think we need some fairness in our society i think some things got out of whack i think we need to fight for working people again i want to restore the democratic party not of nancy pelosi but the democratic party of my dad who wore a union jacket with pride and believed in labor and believed in working families and that s who i am and that s what i m fighting for in our interview we talked about issues and policy mcmurray said it was the first time a reporter had sat down and talked to him in depth about what he really believes and not just the horse race angle of a political campaign the economy trade capitalism vs socialism we spent most of the time talking about economics the nature of capitalism the threat of socialism and trump s trade policies i want to save capitalism from where we are mcmurray said i think capitalism is in danger i think we re moving towards oligarchy i think we re moving toward a society where a few people have all the power and control the democracy and control the vote and control the propaganda that we see every day about who to vote for i can see that in my own race we have potlucks and picnics where it is very successful it seems but unless you re going into that corporate till and getting those 50 000 dollar checks it s almost impossible to compete mcmurray defends capitalism from a populist viewpoint right now those rules are dominated by a clique of corporations and powerful elites mcmurray said it makes sense think about it why would a major corporation hire lawyers i m one of those lawyers they ve hired in the past why would they hire lobbyists to shape and manipulate laws to their benefit everything from labor standards to environmental laws to everything else they re passing the risks on to us a congressperson is supposed to be in there making sure those laws are also fair to help people who don t have that power not the lobbyists we re supposed to be an advocate for regular people big pharma economic elites and the forgotten it s the crony capitalist controlling the system mcmurray said the problem is perhaps most acute in his view in the pharmaceutical industry we have to shorten drug patents mcmurray said they re almost indefinite right now so they can rake everybody over the coals that s why we got people in batavia driving to canada to get medicine because we pay more than any other country so that s what i m talking about they say why aren t you a capitalist yeah i m capitalist but we have to have a capitalistic system that makes sure all stakeholders are considered and not just ones with the money to buy lawyers they can make the laws for them it s this sort of populist resentment of the economic elite setting the rules to benefit themselves that fires up donald trump s base mcmurray said and they re right at 43 married for 20 years with two sons moses 10 and luke 7 mcmurray says he wants to represent the working families of western new york not corporate interests i also believe that the message of president trump is a strong message mcmurray said people have been forgotten in this country now i don t agree with his answers but i agree with that message i believe that we have to remember there s a forgotten america we can see that in the 27th district look at our population decline look at how things have gone downhill for so many people we need someone to advocate for them we know who is advocating for the big corporations mcmurray added i m not taking any corporate money i ve denied corporate money look at my background as a business person that money is accessible to me and it s been painful it s tested my values not to take that money but we re doing everything to try to run this the way the founding fathers intended from a grassroots perspective trade creates opportunities for americans on one hand mcmurray says he shares trump s views that the united states has gotten itself trapped in unfair trade deals based on naive and utopian views of the world on the other when pressed he acknowledges nafta has benefitted the united states and that korus the free trade agreement with south korea has opened up a new market for u s companies in one of his corporate jobs mcmurray helped u s companies find customers in south korea helping to create jobs in the united states which is the exact opposite of what collins claims in one of his campaign commercials the united states needs trade mcmurray said to create opportunities for america s farmers and manufacturers the biggest populations are in asia mcmurray said they re in india and china those are growing economies where people are hungry for new items listen i m someone who has been over there for awhile they would kill for our fords or a nice big truck many chinese guys would love to drive a brand new f 150 we ve got to make sure they have access to it you know many people in china would love clean milk from batavia or clean yogurt from batavia to put up a wall and say we re not going to sell to these people that s lunacy again while saying he agrees with trump on trade he opposes tariffs it s hard after all to call yourself a capitalist and support tariffs i think tariffs are bad mcmurray said i think that it depends on the situation i mean a tariff is a tax essentially it s a tax on whatever business is being poked right now it s a tax on soybean farmers it s a tax on consumers the batavian interjects yes it s a tax i mean they call it a tariff but a tariff is a tax go back and look at our history go back to the boston tea party a tariff is a tax so in principle i m against it regarding mcmurray s economic populism in our interview we raised the issue that much of the resentment expressed by many americans about their economic status is driven by political rhetoric the left in particular for a decade or more has decried wage inequality and wage stagnation the message has stuck even though it doesn t fully account for how every american at every level of society is actually better off than 10 20 even 30 years ago some inequality is needed to power the american dream it s what drives entrepreneurs to create new things and new jobs complaints about wage stagnation ignore the fact that overall compensation has continued to rise driven mainly by employers paying ever increasing health care costs costs that eat up potential raises and that consumer purchasing power has increased decade by decade see this chart from humanprogress org mcmurray replied that he worries that the sense of resentment people feel when the boss makes so much more than they do is an overall threat to the survival of capitalism that perception whether based on reality or not needs to be addressed he said there is definitely some truth that capitalism over time is consistently better mcmurray said this is why i m a capitalist it consistently improves the lives of people it consistently does so i think if you re making the long term argument things have gotten better over time for a lot of people it certainly has but i think there s also the truth that on the top what they have is getting larger and larger and i think that s a threat to the overall system in 2018 mcmurray finds himself in a democratic party that is unlike the democratic party of his father the socialists are surging bernie sanders remains popular and a possible 2020 presidential contender in new york alexandria ocasio cortez a congressional candidate julia salazar a state senate candidate are avowed socialists ten more self identified socialists across the nation have won state house races while more than 50 percent of democrats polled say they ve lost faith in capitalism the democratic socialists of american whose adherents include ocasio cortez and salazar now has more than 50 000 members up from 7 000 less than two years ago given a chance to talk to socialists in his midst mcmurray says he would tell them how misguided they are in their support of socialism which has cost countless millions their lives over the past 100 years and has led to economic ruin everywhere it s been tried he said the idea that capitalism is inherently evil is extremely dangerous to the people who want to embrace socialism i would ask them to look at our history and see the failures of the last 100 years in the world and the many many people who died from these experiments mcmurray said you have to be very cautious about trying to use these social experiments to fix all the there s no magic wand to fix all the world s problems human beings there are many challenges to human life there are things we can do better but i would ask them to remember how great our success as a country has been for the last hundred years opposes unwinnable wars on foreign policy donald trump campaigned as a non interventionist he s governed like a neo conservative if elected mcmurray said he would oppose unwinnable wars well obviously we don t we don t use u s troops unless we re sure about what we re doing and we have a clear goal mcmurray said i would never send my children to war to death to violence without having a clear goal and a clear understanding what we re trying to achieve i think what we are not the world s police i think that s a mistake if elected mcmurray said it will not be his goal to impeach donald trump but he does think congress needs to reassert its rightful place in our system of checks and balances and reclaim some of its power from the executive branch though he pivoted in his answer to a state issue the safe act to illustrate how unchecked power causes people to distrust government we re creeping towards the unintentional destruction of our of our separation of powers system mcmurray said i think the way the executive order has been used by past presidents like president obama has been gratuitous and wrong i think the way we force listen when people feel they re forced to do something or it s not done through the proper process or system they get angry they get apathetic that s why people hate the safe act more than anything else because they feel it was forced upon them in an undemocratic way they are angry about that i agree with that they should be angry about it guns and the second amendment on guns mcmurray supports the second amendment though he won t side he said with the absolutists on the left or the right of the issue i believe the extreme positions on both sides are wrong mcmurray said i believe in universal background checks we have to look at certain weapons and who gets to hold them and how they get to hold them but i can promise you i will not take action without listening to the 2a groups that oppose me now i will talk to these guys i will listen to them because there are a lot of experts i am amazed at the amount of detail and research that has been done on this issue and i believe in the second amendment the gun issue in this campaign came up in a unique way a couple of weeks ago when grand island republican councilman michael madigan complained to local media that mcmurray threatened him he produced a recording where mcmurray said i think you re sick i think you really are i have a gun don t come to my house rather than defend mcmurray s second amendment rights the collins campaign used it as an opportunity to attack him according to a statement released to the buffalo news this obnoxious and borderline violent behavior displayed by nate mcmurray is nothing out of the ordinary said collins campaign spokeswoman natalie baldassarre whether it be his off putting comments on social media or his unprofessional conduct during town meetings it s clear nate needs to learn how to keep his emotions in check this audio is deeply disturbing and further shows nate is unhinged after monday night s event mcmurray defended his reminder to madigan that he owned a gun the right to defend yourself your family and your home is a fundamental right most ny 27 residents support he said he s surprised the collins campaign would attack him over it this is a guy madigan who digs through my garbage and hides in the bushes mcmurray said i told him you come near my house again i m going to defend my family i would say it 100 times it s the way i believe the nra has given mcmurray an f rating on twitter yesterday mcmurray complained that the nra has no voting record on which to judge him and didn t even bother to ask him a single question about gun rights he called the nra corporate hacks the attack on his position on guns by collins he said is just another way collins lies about him some people on the other side the left say i m way too pro gun so i think i m ok mcmurray said i want reasonable steps like universal background checks but i would never do anything to take away the second amendment new york voters have been disappointed a couple of times by democrats who campaigned with conservative and populist themes only to transform into standard issue progressive democrats once they obtained statewide office kathy hochul kirsten gillibrand so you will have to decide for yourself whether to take mcmurray at his word when he espouses conservative values for mcmurray s part he says he wouldn t be where he is living in grand island serving as town supervisor if he wasn t at least a little red we have a very red town and we re proud of that mcmurray said we re proud of what that means we believe in conservatism from a traditional perspective which means you hold onto your traditions and your values and you hold them as important because they re valuable to you they define who you are as a community in that sense i would call myself also a conservative i mean again i grew up as an eagle scout i grew up in a very very christian household i grew up reading very conservative authors i grew up respecting and loving ronald reagan like any kid in the 80s that s who i am and i think we need to get away from this paradigm of republicans versus democrats first and foremost we re americans and americans do not want to be taken advantage of by people like mr collins
at the behest of the white house the inter american development bank canceled its annual meeting this week in china after the beijing government refused to grant a visa to ricardo hausmann the harvard university professor was going to represent venezuela at the event at the command of donald trump hausmann was recorded having a private telephone conversation with lorenzo mendoza the billionaire businessman in 2015 the recording was released by diosdado cabello in the recording hausmann and mendoza spoke of a plan to oust the constitutional government of president nicolás maduro this they hoped would be achieved via a 50 billion intervention from the international monetary fund hausmann also directed the international campaign to limit sales of venezuelan sovereign bonds with help from his friends in washington hausmann has blocked opportunities to refinance the external debt in the way that other countries do and at the same time sabotaged sources of funding and potential business if this is meant to be economic war hausmann who served as minister of planning for the government of president carlos andrés pérez during the 90s sees himself as somewhat of a general in chief in charge of besieging our country the chinese government which supports the legitimate president of venezuela nicolás maduro denied hausmann entry into the country in response u s vice president mike pence ordered the meeting to be suspended and relocated to a more subordinate country washington is the largest shareholder in the idb owning 30 hausmann has been employed by both the idb and the imf and therefore it is difficult to believe that he represents the interests of the venezuelan people the plan to economically stifle venezuelans has not worked nor has the plan to push us over an inflationary cliff when gas prices were in free fall so that the people would turn against the chavista government the emotional blackmail the outright deceit the downright lie the economic situation that would be resolved with the departure of maduro hasn t achieved anything ultimately the dirty trick of using the economy to achieve a political ambition which stalled at the ballot box has failed even so the corporate class both inside and outside venezuela persists in its deadly plan against the venezuelan people this depravity is only matched by those who during the sabotage of the electrical system preferred that the food rot rather than it be rescued it was previously said that inflation was a consequence of the foreign exchange control and that things would only start to get better if the government made the dollar equal to the bolivar well now there is no foreign exchange control the official dollar was leveled but the cost of food medicine and other essential products did not stop rising because inflation is the fickle way in which the corporate class responds to speculation before it was often said that production in the country was zero but now the chambers of commerce speak of losses in the millions during the electrical sabotage to top it off they cried wolf and declared a catastrophe in maracaibo yet the wolf was unleashed with an unexpected ferocity and didn t run to overthrow the government as the corporations had wagered but instead destroyed their very own trading houses just like a horrifying scene from a hollywood zombie movie when i observe the obtuse conduct of the corporate classes in venezuela which at tragic cost have been trying and failing to topple the chavista government since 2002 i always remember how jesus christ spoke in parables to the people so that they would understand the only time he resorted to force and the use of a whip was when he drove the merchants from the temple editor s note diosdado cabello is a former aide to hugo chávez and the current president of the constituent assembly
washington if you think you understand what s going on with the global economy you re probably not paying attention on the one hand the stock market is powering ahead since its recent low on dec 24 it was up 22 4 percent according to the wilshire 5000 total market index which measures the value of all publicly traded u s stocks that s a paper gain of 5 7 trillion asian and european stock markets have also rebounded on the other hand the real economy of jobs and production is slumping in the united states europe and china how can both be true maybe they can t a slowing global economy should weaken the profits of major corporations which in turn should reduce stock prices after all stock values supposedly reflect present and future profits but stocks are advancing not retreating something it seems ought to give either the real economy ought to catch up with the stock market or stocks ought to fall to match the weaker outlook for the real economy for the moment the economy can t seem to make up its mind uneasy about the economy s strength many economists have downgraded their forecasts just recently the federal reserve suspended interest rate increases fearing they might derail the recovery meanwhile stock indexes are trading near historical highs let s examine some numbers the peterson institute for international economics a think tank makes regular economic forecasts here are its latest projections for 2019 growth in the united states will drop from 2 9 percent in 2018 to 2 2 percent in the eurozone the 19 countries in the european union that use the euro the decline will be from 1 8 percent to 1 2 percent and china s growth will fall to 6 1 percent lower than its 2018 rate 6 6 percent economist karen dynan of peterson attributes most of the u s slowdown to the waning effect of the trump administration s 2017 tax cut other recent economic indicators signal weakness a paychex ihs survey of small businesses showed a decline in hiring during march after two months of no job growth similarly the census bureau reported that orders for durable goods industrial machinery oil drilling equipment turbines cars computers and the like were flat even after removing a decline of orders for boeing commercial jets one possible explanation of the economy s slowdown is that the global recovery has benefited from large doses of cheap credit loans bonds and other types of debt and that this torrent of borrowing is now receding although the forms of borrowing whether by governments businesses or consumers differ from country to country a broad credit tightening could undermine the worldwide economic expansion the rise in global debt slowed sharply in 2018 says a new report from the institute of international finance iif in 2017 worldwide debt increased by a staggering 21 trillion according to the report last year the increase was a much smaller 3 3 trillion this slowdown was mainly driven by europe and china the report notes but perhaps the global slowdown is only a pause and the buoyant stock market is simply giving fair warning of a stronger economy commentators have been complaining for years that stocks are overvalued and the market has repeatedly brushed these doubts aside corporate profits have been strong and the market is valuing every dollar of profit at a high multiple deserving of a rich stock price the average pe price to earnings ratio of the standard poor s 500 stock index has averaged 17 since 1936 according to howard silverblatt a senior analyst at s p dow jones indices now the pe exceeds a lofty 22 either the market is mad or it s gushing with good news

10 000 gold as metal of kings reenters monetary system china may have 30 000 tonnes of gold apparently china may have 30 000 tonnes of gold as gold reenters the global monetary system new monetary system backed by gold april 7 king world news dr stephen leeb over the past several years especially since early 2016 the gold market has been stuck in a trading range the price has been low 1 100 s to high 1 300 s or about a 25 percent range i admit that i expected more call me impatient but do not call me wrong over the past several years one event after another have made it utterly clear that we are on a relentless road to a new monetary system backed by gold gold is making its way back into the global monetary system to learn more click here sponsored even the quiet trading range can be seen as masking the seismic yet largely hidden events related to gold the trading range for gold denominated by chinese yuan is a remarkably low 8 percent since mid 2016 as i have said in previous interviews gold flat lining in terms of the yuan hides coming changes while reinforcing a major change which draws ever nearer yuan trading in oil and other commodities is trading that is de facto backed by gold in that any party receiving yuan can exchange that yuan for gold and in those zones where this trading takes place gold can be exported to other countries the ultra tight trading range continues to evidence that the yuan is as good as gold central bank buying of gold highest since nixon i am not going to take a position on whether these trading ranges are the result of central bank intervention or at least in the case of the yuan denominated gold arbitrage but these ranges start to look a bit suspicious when you consider that central bank buying of gold has reached the highest level since nixon took us off the gold standard in 1971 at over 650 tonnes an increase of more than 70 from 2017 moreover for practical purposes that number is likely vastly underestimated as it does not fully reflect china s gold accumulation according to figures released by china the people s bank of china pboc accumulated very little gold about 11 tonnes however as i have stated before credible analysts believe china has been accumulating gold at the rate of about 1 500 or more tonnes a year over at least the past ten years my feeling until very recently is that the pboc was deliberately understating its rate of gold accumulation so as not to spark panic buying china s 30 000 tonne gold hoard i now believe that there may be very little difference between gold held by the pboc and gold held by china s large banks indeed if seasoned analysts such as simon hunt who at wood mackenzie headed one of the world s top gold analytic teams can be believed china may have 30 000 tonnes of gold more than half that gold is likely at major banks and the pboc the division between the pboc and other banks may not be that important a singularly important sub rosa happening explains why though it may be a bit painful go back to 2013 gold entered the year trading in the mid to high 1 600 s many including myself felt the metal was consolidating after making an all time nominal high of over 1 900 toward the end of 2011 a major tailwind for gold at that time was the expectation that the bank for international settlements bis basel iii regulations would give gold a 100 weight as a liquidity buffer on banks balance sheets that would have made gold as good as cash for assessing offsets to risk and incentivized the holding of gold by both central banks and individual banks to make a sad story a short one it did not work out that way to make the sad story even sadder when cyprus got into financial difficulties the imf suggested the country sell gold reserves to boost capital making it utterly clear that bis was not ready to anoint gold as a 100 percent risk offset bonus interview to listen to doug casey s kwn interview discussing his prediction of financial and economic chaos and a panic into gold click here or below sponsored gold promptly entered a full fledged correction which did not end until the december of 2015 when the yellow metal briefly traded below 1 050 admittedly with the caveat that bis can always change regulations as of march 29th the date the latest version of basal iii went into effect gold is a 100 percent liquidity buffer prelude to gold s entry into the monetary system so why has the world just yawned at this change one reason is that it has not been widely advertised another could be central banks desire to keep gold in a trading range banks keeping gold in a trading range is not necessarily conspiratorial thinking in that the eventual outcome could be a trading range for gold at a much higher level central banks could reasonably argue that by maintaining a trading range they are preparing the world for gold s entry into the monetary system each month the bis publishes a long paper 150 or more pages of mostly highly technical details about banking finance and risk control probably more due to luck than skill i found the following paragraph in the december 2017 paper which was titled finalising post crisis reforms to be precise the paragraph was number 96 in the first section of the paper it read a 0 risk weight will apply to i cash owned and held at the bank or in transit and ii gold bullion held at the bank or held in another bank on an allocated basis to the extent the gold bullion assets are backed by bullion liabilities even that single sentence was challenging to interpret at least for me at first i thought the last phrase viz to the extent modified all of ii but it doesn t it only modifies the part referring to gold that is allocated to the bank and means until the gold is delivered the bank must carry liabilities sufficient to pay in full for the gold alert mining legend ross beaty chairman pan american silver is investing in a company very few people know about to find out which company click here or on the image below sponsored the bottom line is that bis which is often referred to as the central bank of central banks has issued guidelines that equate gold and cash as a risk or liquidity buffer to explain why this is so important realize that any asset on a bank s balance sheet is assigned a risk weighting ranging from o to sometimes over 100 in the case of problematic loans each asset is multiplied by its risk weighting and the results are then summed bis guidelines suggest that the bank s common core equity surplus cash common shares and other items that get full weight in defining a bank s net worth should be at least 4 5 to 6 of the sum of risk weighted assets this means that if a bank makes a loan and the loan has a 50 risk weighting the bank s ratio of core equity to risk weighted assets will go down one way of keeping the ratio stable would be to sell assets for either cash or gold from a long term perspective gold is much better than cash a 1925 dollar is worth 07 today while gold has appreciated substantially outperforming the dollar by 65 fold this explains the urgent buying of gold by central banks but also explains why the pboc may not be holding a lot more gold than it says the pboc could have acquired gold on behalf of its commercial banks and those banks could hold massive amounts of gold on their balance sheets when gold is revalued which is inevitable those banks will be far and away the strongest banks in the world and indeed the entire chinese economy will be sitting on extremely strong footing bonus interview mag silver co founder says this company may have just found the source of arizona mining s massive 1 3 billion taylor deposit click here or below sponsored april 1st was the tenth anniversary of the publication of a fairly brief paper published by bis and authored by the then head of the pboc zhou xiaochuan the paper argued for a new monetary system that would be based on sdrs one statement in it stands out the basket of currencies forming the basis for sdr valuation should include currencies of all major economies the sdr can be shifted from a purely calculation based system to a system backed by real assets zhou shrewdly does not mention gold but clearly since all major real assets other than gold are primarily used by industry and cannot be fixed in price gold is the only asset that fits the bill 10 000 gold i have argued for some time that the new monetary system will be based on blockchains of gold backed sdrs the light at the end of this epic tunnel is gleaming inexorably brighter given the amount of gold in the world available as a reserve pool to back up sdrs and the amount of yearly trade and total debt the kind of monetary system i envision will eventually mean a gold price well above 10 000 my guess is that gold will see step wise revaluations with each revaluation followed by a trading range in other words gold s price will be managed much like short term interest rates in the us and

washington the rising power of a few corporate giants could weaken investment deter innovation and reduce the share of income paid to workers in advanced economies according to a new report by the international monetary fund imf while the overall macroeconomic effects of the rising monopoly problem have been modest so far further increases in the market power of big companies could become increasingly negative if they were left unchecked the problem could take a bigger toll on economic growth and people s incomes in the future warned the imf which urged policymakers to keep the market competition strong speaking at the u s chamber of commerce imf managing director christine lagarde talked about the increasing concentration of market power in advanced economies she said a small number of highly successful companies accounted for the highest price markups according to the imf the price markup how much a company charges for its products compared with how much it costs to produce is a good measurement of market power when a company s market power increases it can maximize its profits by charging a higher price and reducing its output in other words there is a winner takes most dynamic at play especially pronounced in the digital economy lagarde said i am not saying that we currently have a monopoly problem but i am saying that we should take appropriate measures so that it does not become a problem increase in market power would lead a company to reduce its demand for capital and therefore its investment according to the imf study it also stifles innovation as the firm would have less incentive to innovate to stay competitive the study also found that increased market power since 2000 has accounted for at least 10 percent of the drop in the share of labor income in advanced economies lagarde urged policymakers in countries such as the united states to take necessary measures to prevent the escalation of the problem in the future that means reducing barriers to entry for new firms and reforming competition frameworks to ensure a level playing field in all sectors whether traditional or high tech she said a problem in advanced economies imf studied the monopoly problem using data for nearly 1 million companies from 27 countries both advanced and emerging markets since the beginning of the 2000s according to the report the price markup increases are more concentrated in advanced economies than in emerging markets this increase in markups has taken place in most industries with the largest among technology firms and higher markups have been concentrated among a small number of companies companies with the highest markups raised their average markup by more than 30 percent since 2000 these companies are more profitable and productive than their competitors they also have more intangible assets like patents and software than others in many markets the rising market power of the more productive and innovative companies has been helped by their superior ability to exploit proprietary intangible assets network effects and economies of scale reduced costs per unit as output increases the report stated in the united states for example these high markup companies have also expanded in size in relation to their low markup counterparts contributing to a larger increase in aggregate markups compared with europe the high markup companies may attempt to entrench their positions by building barriers to entry such as high customer switching costs therefore it is important for policymakers to ensure a level playing field among all companies stated the report president donald trump has been vocal in his criticism of tech giants particularly amazon in an interview in november 2018 he said his administration was looking into antitrust violations by amazon google and facebook imf predicts no recession the 2019 imf and world bank spring meetings will be held in washington on april 12 through 14 he has also repeatedly accused amazon of scamming the u s postal service and he has been critical of amazon ceo jeff bezos who owns the washington post the 2019 imf and world bank spring meetings will be held in washington on april 12 through 14 in its january report the imf projected that the global economy would grow at 3 5 percent in 2019 and 3 6 in 2020 lagarde said that the global economy is at a delicate moment the imf cut its global growth forecast twice since last october due to slowing chinese economic growth the u s china trade war and financial worries in emerging markets but to be clear we do not see a recession in the near term lagarde said in fact we expect some pickup in growth in the second half of 2019 and into 2020 global economic activity is set to benefit from the recent policy responses such as the federal reserve s more patient pace of monetary policy normalization and increased stimulus in china according to her
there s good news for people living in las vegas miami and phoenix the risk of a housing bust like the one they endured during the global financial crisis is fairly small for folks in toronto and vancouver however the picture hasn t improved since 2008 and the risk of a large decline in house prices remains elevated those are among the insights generated by the imf s new tool for assessing the danger of a severe downturn in home prices homeowners of course are keenly interested in the value of what is probably their biggest asset but there is also a strong link between home prices the financial system and the economy the link is especially powerful when prices go down as we explain in chapter two of the imf s twice yearly global financial stability report why do home prices matter for the broader economy housing construction and related spending on things like home improvements account for one sixth of the us and euro area economies making them among the largest components of gdp what s more mortgages and other housing related lending are a big part of banks assets in many countries so changes in house prices affect the health of the banking system boom bust cycle it s no surprise then that more than two thirds of financial crises in recent decades were preceded by a boom bust cycle in home prices and that central banks in the united states china australia and elsewhere have recently expressed concern about large increases in home prices fortunately the imf s new tool can help policy makers gauge the likelihood of a future housing downturn and take early steps to help limit the damage the tool dubbed house prices at risk feeds into the fund s growth at risk model which links financial conditions to the danger of an economic downturn see the october 2017 gfsr our study encompasses data from 22 advanced economies 10 emerging market economies and the major cities in those countries we found that in most advanced economies in our sample weighted by gdp the odds of a big drop in inflation adjusted house prices were lower at the end of 2017 than 10 years earlier but remained above the historical average in emerging markets by contrast riskiness was higher in 2017 than on the eve of the global financial crisis nonetheless downside risks to house prices remain elevated in more than 25 percent of these advanced economies and reached nearly 40 percent in emerging markets in our study among them china stands out especially its eastern provinces readers may wonder how we came to these conclusions first we identified five conditions that affect home prices past price growth economic growth credit booms overvaluation and financial conditions then we asked ourselves a question if we look at large drops in home prices those that occur roughly once every 20 years that is those that have a 5 percent probability can they be predicted by changes in those five conditions what happens if say financial conditions tighten households are loaded up on debt and house prices are stretched the answer in this scenario we can expect to see more instances of very large declines in home prices synchronized swings interestingly good news today may signal greater danger further down the road in the short term easy credit supports home prices but longer term easy credit could fuel overborrowing by homeowners making a bust more likely and as described in the april 2018 gfsr house prices in major cities around the world move in tandem making it more likely that a shock in one country will affect housing markets elsewhere significantly we also found that large declines in home prices are associated with economic contractions and risks to financial stability for example our estimates show that a reading of minus 12 on our gauge corresponding to a 5 percent probability of a 12 percent drop in prices indicates a 31 percent probability of a financial crisis two years later in advanced economies and a 10 percent probability in emerging markets that makes our new model a useful predictive tool for policy makers seeking to keep their economies and financial systems on an even keel policy choices how should policy makers respond to heightened home price riskiness while they shouldn t try to target prices our results show that there are early steps they can take to improve the resilience of households banks and the economy one is to tighten so called macroprudential policies when the economy is strong and housing is booming these policies include restricting the amount of a home loan as a proportion of the property s value and limiting the size of monthly mortgage payments as a proportion of income another option is cutting the central bank s interest rate although our results suggest that this may only help to mitigate near term risks up to a few quarters ahead and only in advanced economies measures to manage capital flows might also help these countries when a surge in capital inflows increases downside risks to house prices while our analysis focused on cyclical factors other policy instruments may be considered as well including longer term structural policies to increase the housing supply or impose zoning restrictions or fiscal measures such as property taxes so there are ways to mitigate the risks with the help of our tool policy makers can take the appropriate steps in a timely manner and prevent a crisis like the one that shook the world in 2008 by claudio raddatz and nico valckx this is a repost from the imf blog here
pakistan and the international monetary fund imf have been unable to sort out differences over the fiscal policy because of the latter s demand that the federal tax collection be increased to nearly 13 of the size of the country s economy within a year sources in the ministry of finance told the express tribune that if the government accepted the imf demand a tax collection target of around rs5 4 trillion would have to be set for the fiscal year 2019 20 under the present circumstances and an extremely poor performance in the outgoing fiscal year the federal board of revenue fbr would be unable to collect more than rs4 9 trillion in the next fiscal year starting from july the disagreement over the fbr s collection target is also undermining a deal on the budget deficit target for the next fiscal year based on very high tax collection assumptions the imf is inclined to give a tight budget deficit target for the fiscal year 2018 19 the pakistan tehreek e insaf pti government had set a rs4 4 trillion tax collection target for the fbr however looking at the board s performance in the first nine months it is unlikely to collect over rs4 trillion sources in the fbr told the express tribune the fbr fell short of the target by nearly rs318 billion and could rake in only rs2 68 trillion the rs4 trillion tax collection target is equal to 10 6 of the gdp and to increase it to 13 the fbr would have to generate an additional amount of rs1 45 trillion this would require a 36 growth rate which is impossible to achieve the fbr sources added the fbr has so far posted an average growth of 2 in revenue from july to march after taking into account the positive impact of the nominal gdp rate of nearly 12 inflation plus the real gdp the fbr would still need to take unprecedented measures to meet the imf demand to achieve a target collection target of rs5 trillion the government would have to impose additional taxes of around rs500 billion for the fiscal year 2019 20 the sources said the new situation in the wake of massive revenue shortfall would be explained to the imf during a staff level visit expected in the third week of this month the imf may eventually agree to a target of around rs5 trillion which will be equal to 12 of the next year s gdp size finance minister asad umar said on friday that the deal with the imf was almost done and an agreement could be reached during his visit to washington starting from tuesday the government had hoped that the increase in inflation and exchange rate adjustments would have a positive impact on tax collection however it failed to achieve the desired results by the end of the ninth month of this fiscal year during november s failed round of talks the government had expected that the fbr would improve its collection this fiscal year and that would help in taking less additional revenue measures in 2019 20 the sources said pakistan was keen to increase the fbr s tax to gdp ratio by 1 1 of the gdp in the next fiscal year followed by 0 9 of the gdp in the fiscal year 2020 21 during the last fiscal year the fbr s tax to gdp ratio stood at 11 2 the next fiscal year would not be easy for the government as well as for the people the government plans a crackdown against tax evasion particularly in the real estate sector under invoicing of imports and offshore taxation the general sales tax gst effective rate is around 7 25 against the standard rate of 17 because of various tax exemptions and special tax regimes an integrated value added tax system could improve the effective rate but that would also require a massive withdrawal of exemptions the finance minister would unveil the government s five year macroeconomic plan on monday but without releasing specific targets umar said last week that the macroeconomic targets could only be shared once an agreement is reached with the imf the government s five year plan may touch some politically sensitive areas like tax collection from the agriculture sector and gst on provincial services to improve the meagre rs2 billion tax collection from the farm sector the federal government may ask the provinces to hand over this task to the centre the tax collected from each province as a result would not be part of the divisible pool and could be directly transferred to the respective province according to the proposed plan there may be a merit in reverting back to the pre 18th amendment arrangement on the collection of gst on services where the provinces agreed that tax could be collected by the federal government but the revenue would be transferred directly to the province from where it originated however sindh is likely to oppose the move the government may also announce the harmonisation of the tax code and integrate tax processes through digitisation and process automation the sources said the government planned to enact a law to ensure that no tax exemption was allowed through a notification without an independent estimate of its cost by the tax department as well as the ministry concerned the cost would be made public before the exemption is notified the government would also review all existing exemptions to eliminate as many as possible it would ensure that all exemptions existing or newly proposed had a sunset clause the government is likely to publish a list of all government owned enterprises availing exemptions concessions in any way along with the quantification of the tax expenditure the federal government is also considering simplifying tariff rates
by this time of the year you probably have already filed your income tax return or have the finish line in sight and through it all you probably have asked yourself what else can i do to shave the tax bite on my investment portfolio actually there s a lot that can be done as several types of investments offer at least modest tax shaving potential and for the most part these investment tax benefits weren t undercut by tax reform these are some of the more popular choices iras plenty of versatility individual retirement accounts aren t a type of investment but rather a type of account into which you can place all sorts of stuff and receive tax benefits all iras offer tax deferred growth of your investment dollars after that things get more complex but also more beneficial with traditional iras you essentially can deduct the money you put into an account then as noted it builds up tax deferred until you withdraw it when your contributions and gains are taxed as ordinary income getting an extension how to file an extension on taxes ira mistakes to avoid social security ira and tax mistakes to avoid when planning retirement if you withdraw money prematurely generally before age 59½ you face a 10 penalty you also need to start taking withdrawals by around age 70½ or an even bigger 50 penalty could apply one nice thing about iras you typically can make a contribution as late as april 15 and apply the deduction to reduce your tax bill for the prior year fidelity investments reports that 33 of all the 2018 ira contributions made by its customers came in during the three weeks leading up to the april 15 deadline with roth iras the tax benefits are reversed you don t get a deduction up front but you also don t pay taxes on withdrawals assuming you meet minimum holding period requirements with roths there are also no required minimum distributions starting around 70½ matches boost 401 k accounts as good as iras can be more contributions have been flowing into workplace 401 k style retirement accounts from a tax standpoint 401 k plans work like traditional iras in that you get a deduction on contributions your gains build up tax free then you face regular taxes on withdrawals many employers also offer a roth 401 k option meaning you would forsake the deduction but your withdrawals would come out tax free several factors explain why 401 k s are popular matching funds are a big one as many employers will encourage you to save by pitching in perhaps 50 cents for every dollar you invest up to certain limits also the accounts are convenient in that the money is diverted automatically from each paycheck without you having to think about each investment decision but while people are putting more new money into 401 k plans a lot of that cash will wind up in an ira eventually when leaving jobs workers can choose to retain the tax deferral on their accounts by rolling the money into an ira in fact ira dollar volumes have been boosted much more by rollovers in recent years than by new contributions new life for municipal bonds for tax minimization in the bond world municipal bonds reign supreme the interest paid by bonds issued by states cities counties and

bonds typically yield less than treasurys corporates and other bonds whose interest is taxed at the federal level but many people still like them especially during periods when interest rates are stable and especially among investors in high tax brackets investment firm columbia threadneedle notes that municipal bonds historically have fared well during periods of slowing economic growth they re also fairly price stable without subjecting investors to often wild rides these bonds have generated positive returns including interest income in 31 of the past 35 years the company said one caveat to beware while the interest is generally tax free you must report it to calculate whether some of your social security benefits might be taxable assuming you re collecting social security as

according to larry kudlow head of mr trump s national economic council the president wants a rate cut of 0 50 i somewhat agree that a rate cut would help the economy at this moment but i will also add some very important details later on last year i had expected inflation and therefore treasury yields to fall almost everybody on wall street was expecting the opposite and they were betting against us treasuries crashing longer dated treasuries for a few months in june i wrote that longer dated us treasuries which were arguably the most frowned upon major investment class may prove the best investment again they did prove to be an excellent investment and arguably the best among the major investment classes stocks real estate corporate bonds or emerging markets by the end of last year although risk assets have done very well this year so far i am still pessimistic about the remainder of the year nonetheless us treasuries have still done very well compared with june last year as they have offered 2 90 in yield and also investment appreciation due to the fact that inflation has moderated therefore longer dated treasury bond have become dearer as yields have fallen this is what i argued for in the june article inflation is proving elusive and despite what almost everybody expected until around the fourth quarter of last year inflation has been unable to overshoot the fed s 2 target as it can be seen in the chart below the fed s preferred inflation gauge core inflation cpi has only occasionally touched 2 in recent years the economy has also continued to soften not just in the rest of the world but also in the us which had for quite a while defied the global slowdown that started early last year this in itself may not present a compelling argument for the fed to cut rates but the more worrisome issue is rather the stubborn lack of inflation or at least this is how i see things those at the fed may not concur yet mr trump is also worried about the prospects of the economy and he is blaming the fed for the current slowdown as he had also warned prior to the last rate hike in december the real worry is in fact the housing market and what inflation or the lack of it is saying about it for the first time since 2012 rents dropped on a yearly basis in late 2018 many might view this only as a positive for consumers and perhaps even the economy as a whole but things are more complicated than that modern economic theory is shaped and founded mostly by accident i guess on asset prices rather than productivity falling assets prices are simply bad no matter how inflated they are this may be bad for the society causing too much income gap and so on but that is how things work now according to modern economic theory last time the most important asset class housing had a sharp fall in value the world economy suffered its worst contraction since the great depression central bankers spearheaded by the fed have for decades orchestrated almost miraculously quick economic recoveries through their tested ability they might not pass the next test though to pump asset prices after every economic downturn and they have been able to do this by cutting their policy rates sharply at every economic slowdown this is the reason why the fall in us rents that started last year is not exactly a good sign first i wrote about rents falling was back in february 2018 and i referred to it as a good indicator for trouble ahead back then it was only about some of the largest metropolitan areas like new york san francisco etc now it is a nationwide reality this is not a good sign for house prices in the near future after all the most important factor for real estate valuation is the yield a falling yield will eventually lead to a fall in the value of the underlying asset housing prices have moderated nationwide but they haven t started to fall yet furthermore sales have been falling since the middle of last year and this combined with the fact that house prices have already started to get deep cuts in some of the most important markets manhattan san francisco miami etc does not bode well for the future of the housing market in the coming quarters rents also first started falling in the most sophisticated markets and then across the country the continuation of this trend softening housing market in the coming quarters will be quite a challenge for the 2 target rate of the fed housing is more than 40 of cpi a deflationary housing environment all but ruins overall inflation it is true that a fall in mortgage rates over the past couple of months has meant a positive for the housing market it is still far from certain that it will be able to stop the slowdown in the housing market there is no sign yet of any pause in the multifamily supply chart below as near record numbers of newly built apartments are expected to hit the market additional supply combined with an already weaker economy seems like the best recipe for more pressure on rents and housing prices this looks to me like a pretty bad outlook for the housing market and a bad housing market as evidenced by the severity of the last recession means real trouble for the economy should the fed cut its policy rate then in order to save the housing market and hence the economy an immediate cut to the fed funds rate could indeed come in very handy or at least for the coming few quarters as it would also offer a meaningful boost to the economy i am not so sure about the durability of the effects of such a measure though fed policy makers on the other hand have a much greater concern at hand that s why they will not cut rates as mr trump wishes what concerns the fed most is the reality that can be seen in the chart below the fed had to cut rates by at least 500 basis points 5 in order to relaunch economic growth after some very benign economic downturns like the ones in early 2000s or in early 1990s the severity of the downturn after the 2008 crash meant that a 5 cut was insufficient so qe was invented as a popular phrase for digitally printing new money to offer some additional stimulus to the economy nobody knows exactly how efficient qe was but looking at how long it took for the economy to recover this time it was obviously not that good as the current fed funds rate is just above 2 very far from 5 it is anybody s guess what will happen when recession hits again this is also a serious concern for fed officials they are legitimately wary of the potency of the remaining interest rate ammunition they have at their disposal and i believe they will prefer to hold off until things start to get ugly which they are not now the stock market has recovered quite a lot since late last year and there are no other serious and immediate economic hazards out there the tricky thing is that in the absence of a rate cut now the housing market will continue to deteriorate and the more it deteriorates the deeper a rate cut will be needed to stabilize it at some point the fed will start cutting rates and it will either happen because of a scary crash in the stock market or a significant worsening of the economy or both but i doubt the fed will take a more proactive role as usually desired by presidents to stave off a possible slowdown in the near future the last time the fed acted because of presidential pressure was in 1971 when then fed chairman arthur burns reversed course on rate hikes as mr nixon had desired it is true that unlike early 1970s inflationary pressures are very far from threatening at this moment and i do not see many other similarities between 1971 and 2019 however i doubt those academic minds at the fed will see the inflationary mess that took over the 1970s as nothing but another reason not to bend to the current president s profligate leanings many market participants will probably be very disappointed to find out about this in the near future that the fed will not be as accommodative as they had hoped
n july 1995 vermont s state auditor wrote a letter to the speaker of the house copying the senate leader and the governor the auditor ed flanagan could not have been more clear about the likely consequences of a proposal to shortchange the teachers pension fund by some 7 million it is not fiscally prudent for us to promise today what others will have to pay for tomorrow flanagan wrote to mike obuchowski the former house leader this type of generational inequity is both unfair and fiscally unsound the auditor said gov howard dean s administration was misguided in its claim that retirement funds were very healthy adding that the governor was violating statute by ignoring the recommendations of retirement fund boards by underfunding the retirement system today we only delay an inevitable reckoning flanagan wrote it amounts to a kind of camouflaged deficit spending because the state must eventually cure the funding deficiency the dean administration underfunded anyhow and the legislature signed off on it and the state continued to shortchange the pension system for the next decade a generation later flanagan and others who urged fiscal prudence have been vindicated the state needs about 3 38 billion to cover future teachers pension liabilities but after years of underfunding and underperforming investments only about 55 of that is in its pension fund leaving an unfunded liability of 1 513 billion according to the state s actuaries to pay that off vermont policymakers have committed 120 million this year and an average of 150 million over the next 20 years and that s just to catch up on the old payments and debt service that doesn t included the normal ongoing cost of the pensions which is about 7 million this year members also pay in 5 to 6 of their paychecks although vermont s economy is humming right now about 40 of the 54 million in expected surplus state revenue this year is going to be consumed by the pension liability when that s combined with other debts and reserve funding there s little money left for new social programs or infrastructure the same type of programs and projects enabled by underfunding in the 90s sen jane kitchel d caledonia chair of the senate appropriations committee has been preparing fellow lawmakers and advocates for disappointment as this year s budget process unfolds when people are coming in saying why don t you do more for this particular service area or this program hasn t had a benefit increase in years the expectation is there s more money kitchel said but if you take 40 right off then and then you ve got to deal with all those ups there s nothing left kitchel was on the other side of the budget conversation in the 1990s as the secretary of human services she said that the dean administration was telling legislators not to worry about the underfunding because investment returns were so strong when you have so many competing priorities and you re sitting around and if someone is saying that their conclusion is that the underfunding isn t going to be a problem then that s kind of an attractive option to take she said obuchowski the former speaker said the political calculation was straightforward there was a sense that there were bigger needs than paying an annuity i think it was that simple that people saw the needs of common ordinary people and made the judgement that we can short this a little bit now and pay for it later he said dean had promised to abide by a 1991 pact forged between speaker ralph wright and gov richard snelling to retire the state s deficit which had soared under gov madeleine kunin there was a lot of pressure at that time pressure to spend and there wasn t any revenue to go after obuchowski said the tension between pension obligations and current needs health care education food and housing always exists obuchowski added he said there was spirited debate in the legislature over whether to accept dean s recommendation to underfund on pensions and spend elsewhere does everybody bear some responsibility for this yes is there a lesson here yes he said there s really nobody with clean hands vermont s unfunded teachers pension liability explained graphic by felippe rodrigues flanagan who died in 2017 wasn t the only state official telling legislators to look long term and follow the advice of actuaries whose job is to assess risk in the state s finances former gov jim douglas who was treasurer from 1995 to 2003 was part of the chorus warning against underfunding i felt as a fiduciary as a trustee of the systems i needed to advocate for full funding and did but you know didn t always succeed douglas said i think there was a greater sense of optimism and that was well founded in terms of the actual returns on our investments then the recession of 2000 offered a dose of reality to a degree and then obviously the great recession of 07 and 09 was a heavy dose of reality the funded ratio of the teacher s retirement fund the value of assets compared with the value of liabilities steadily increased during the dean administration hitting a peak of 90 7 in 2005 then it started falling when the recession hit in 2008 it dropped from 80 9 to 65 4 in a single year a decade later it s at 55 2 poor decisions were made said beth pearce the current treasurer who entered office in 2011 if you don t invest your dollars you lose the ability to to take advantage of compound interest and when you do that the taxpayer suffers kitchel made the same point recalling a lesson on compound interest from the movie mary poppins pearce said actuaries have estimated that at least 25 million of what the state is paying for unfunded pensions each year is because of chronic underfunding by multiple administrations and multiple legislatures from 1989 to 2007 but she stressed that s the minimum figure and it could be far higher vtdigger s own analysis shows that underfunding since 1979 the furthest back we could find data for has cost about 430 million if you factor in real inflation and assume annual returns of 5 5 the state hires an actuary every year to make a recommendation for how much it should pay into teacher and state employee pensions which is also underfunded to a lesser degree because the pension fund needs to cover obligations that will be paid out decades from now the recommendation is based on long term projections of pension costs and financial returns as well as human factors like how long retired teachers will live on average when they will retire and how many beneficiaries will also collect while dean was not the first governor to ignore the advice of actuaries and fiduciaries in state government the practice goes back at least to the late 1970s his 11 plus years at the helm saw unprecedented underfunding both in scale and duration teachers pensions were underfunded each of his years in office from august 1991 to january 2003 in 1996 his budget allocated 11 5 million to the unfunded liability just 38 4 of the recommended 29 9 million on average payments to the retirement system were only 70 of what actuaries recommended during dean s tenure the cost of underfunding over the decades graphic by felippe rodrigues dean said in an interview that he has no regrets about his decisions regarding pension funding he said it was one of many tough decisions during a time of fiscal austerity and it was preferable to some of the other options i just wasn t going to take health care away from poor people and i wasn t going to raise people s property taxes by shifting it all out of the education department he said so i chose not to fully fund the pension dean a democrat known for fiscal conservatism said that while he accepted responsibility for his part in the current situation underfunding wasn t the only factor he pointed to poor investment returns over the past decade as a major reason for the funding gap well there were an awful lot of people who did much better than we did in terms of how their investments performed and ours is kind of at the bottom of the heap he said i mean there were large funds that increased their value by twice the percentage that ours did so i mean one might make the argument over the last 15 or 20 years since i was governor that there were a lot of reasons for this dean argued that if vermont s retirement fund investment managers a board vice chaired by the treasurer had hit the projected returns over the past two decades the pension funds would be in far better shape dean s practice of underfunding continued into douglas tenure following his election in 2002 in his first four years in office the pension funds were paid into at 70 of the actuary s recommendation going as low as 50 in 2006 but starting in 2007 payments either met or exceeded the actuarial recommendation and that has continued until now douglas a republican remembered during his time as treasurer unsuccessfully lobbying jeb spaulding the senate appropriations chair to fully fund pensions then spaulding became treasurer and tried to convince douglas as governor to fully fund and i d say well gosh let s go to the tape here douglas said of those conversations with spaulding adding where you stand depends where you sit spaulding declined to be interviewed douglas also blamed much of the underfunding on the gap between projected returns which were as high as 8 25 in 2010 and actual returns the investment returns target is central to the actuary s recommendation so when investments underperform it can dramatically expand the unfunded liability in the 10 year period leading up to 2016 vermont achieved about a 4 5 annual return on both its teachers and state employees pension funds near the bottom of national rankings according the pew charitable trust the south dakota retirement system has hit the highest returns in the country during that time at almost 7 no state met or exceeded its investment return target pearce accused pew of having an ideological bent and said 10 year snapshots can be misleading because of market volatility december wasn t a great time for us january has been a little bit better so depending on when you look at those numbers you re going to get different results she said the treasurer s office boasts a 7 7 annual return for the state teachers retirement system in the seven year period through june 30 2017 pew said in an email that its work is fact based nonpartisan and designed to serve the public interest pearce added that the state has recalibrated investment strategies to reduce risk since the great recession in fiscal 2009 the teachers pension fund lost 177 million of value in a single year only 53 of the state s pension funds were invested in equities up until last month when the investment committee switched up the formula according to pearce that means vermont has not benefited as much as it could have from a booming stock market to me you don t want to put 80 of your money in stocks for instance you might do that at home you might take your own bet on that but downside risk is important to the taxpayer pearce said and for us we want to be that steady upward trend and not that big volatile up and down the new investment formula allocates 71 to growth assets which includes equities and while the pension assets have grown more slowly than expected the liabilities have ballooned largely because of rising health care costs douglas noted that during his administration government accounting standards changed requiring states to include health care in their projected costs so that caused an immediate decline in the funded status and an increase in the the actuarial recommended payment each year he said the state has since set up a separate teachers health care fund that has quickly caught up with pensions accruing almost 1 billion in unfunded liability on its own but unlike with pensions there is no statutory obligation to prefund health care though pearce has started a push to store away some money douglas said he is skeptical about the state s 7 5 target for investment returns which is two points above average returns across the country in the past 10 years which means that the actual underfunding might even be greater now he said you mention the 2038 amortization period i mean we ve gone after those before and we keep recalculating and so i hope it s paid off in 20 years we ll see pew says the next 20 years will see annual returns of 6 5 from a typical institutional investment portfolio but it says there s a 25 chance the yearly returns don t even top 5 despite the greater risk incurred public sector plans continue to see real returns underperform against actuarial assumptions pew wrote keeping the target for returns higher is attractive for the same reason as underfunding it means the state has to put less money in the funds now because it will be made up by earnings down the road if actual returns are significantly below expectations that could have a huge impact on the size of annual payments or it could require the state to recalculate its repayment plan entirely pearce said she has hired a consultant to look at the 7 5 figure and conduct a risk assessment to determine whether it should be revised she declined to speculate on how much the pension funding arc would shift if the number were revised down by a point or more but said her process for setting the target is entirely apolitical whatever materializes in the years to come the treasurer wants the state to keep making its pension payments there are no silver bullets there s only fiscal discipline she said and we need to do the right thing now so that we don t end up having the same conversation 20 years down the road

reuters saudi arabia s threat to sell its oil in currencies other than the dollar if the united states enacts anti opec legislation is an empty one but it illustrates the extent of tensions between the two governments over oil prices senior saudi officials have discussed a plan to stop invoicing oil in dollars and switch to other currencies if the no oil producing and exporting cartels act nopec recently introduced in congress becomes law the threat has been communicated to top officials in washington and leaked to signal the strength of the kingdom s opposition invoicing oil sales in euros or yuan would aim to damage the u s dollar s status as the petro recycling currency and its reserve status more generally weakening its value and taking aim at u s financial dominance in practice the threat is not credible since the kingdom relies almost totally on the united states for its security including purchases of armaments and training intelligence sharing and support in its conflict in yemen the kingdom could not afford to jeopardize its security relationship and close ties with the present u s administration but it does illustrate the strain on relations that has emerged between the kingdom and the united states especially the white house over the desirable level of oil prices those tensions are likely to intensify as the united states gears up for congressional and presidential elections in november 2020 on most issues saudi arabia s rulers and the white house are more closely aligned than ever before especially in their shared commitment to confronting iran saudi arabia is central to the regional security system the u s administration has been trying to assemble to contain iran s influence in the middle east in turn saudi arabia has become increasingly dependent on the united states for its internal and external security as its conflict with iran escalates both in the diplomatic arena and in wars being fought by proxy in the region the u s and saudi governments need each other on the issue of oil prices however the two disagree sharply u s president donald trump has made clear he wants oil prices to remain below 70 per barrel in a series of messages posted on twitter and delivered in television interviews saudi arabia by contrast needs prices well over 70 and probably over 80 to shore up its government finances pay for an expensive economic transformation and stem the deterioration in its own balance of payments like most first term presidents trump s over riding priority is to be re elected all other policy considerations will be subordinated to that aim the president has calculated correctly his marginal voter next year will be a motorist in the midwest so he needs moderately low gasoline prices at least until after election day so far nopec bills introduced into the u s house of representatives and senate have made little progress and the administration has adopted a non committal attitude to them if oil prices rise to 80 or more however the bills may start to make more progress through the legislative process as lawmakers respond to pressure from their constituents the higher the prices rise and the nearer election day comes the greater the prospect the nopec legislation will start to move forward at 85 90 congress will take more notice at 90 95 the bill could make it to the president s desk and at 95 100 the president might direct the attorney general to initiate legal proceedings saudi arabia cannot be sure whether the president would sign or veto a nopec bill if it was approved by both chambers and presented to him in fact the president has every incentive to maintain constructive ambiguity since it provides a useful source of leverage to ensure saudi arabia cooperates with his re election effort in circumstances where oil prices are high and rising the president might demand an output increase and lower oil prices in exchange for vetoing the bill
by this time of the year you probably have already filed your income tax return or have the finish line in sight and through it all you probably have asked yourself what else can i do to shave the tax bite on my investment portfolio actually there s a lot that can be done as several types of investments offer at least modest tax shaving potential and for the most part these investment tax benefits weren t undercut by tax reform these are some of the more popular choices iras plenty of versatility individual retirement accounts aren t a type of investment but rather a type of account into which you can place all sorts of stuff and receive tax benefits all iras offer tax deferred growth of your investment dollars after that things get more complex but also more beneficial with traditional iras you essentially can deduct the money you put into an account then as noted it builds up tax deferred until you withdraw it when your contributions and gains are taxed as ordinary income getting an extension how to file an extension on taxes ira mistakes to avoid social security ira and tax mistakes to avoid when planning retirement if you withdraw money prematurely generally before age 59½ you face a 10 penalty you also need to start taking withdrawals by around age 70½ or an even bigger 50 penalty could apply one nice thing about iras you typically can make a contribution as late as april 15 and apply the deduction to reduce your tax bill for the prior year fidelity investments reports that 33 of all the 2018 ira contributions made by its customers came in during the three weeks leading up to the april 15 deadline with roth iras the tax benefits are reversed you don t get a deduction up front but you also don t pay taxes on withdrawals assuming you meet minimum holding period requirements with roths there are also no required minimum distributions starting around 70½ matches boost 401 k accounts as good as iras can be more contributions have been flowing into workplace 401 k style retirement accounts from a tax standpoint 401 k plans work like traditional iras in that you get a deduction on contributions your gains build up tax free then you face regular taxes on withdrawals many employers also offer a roth 401 k option meaning you would forsake the deduction but your withdrawals would come out tax free several factors explain why 401 k s are popular matching funds are a big one as many employers will encourage you to save by pitching in perhaps 50 cents for every dollar you invest up to certain limits also the accounts are convenient in that the money is diverted automatically from each paycheck without you having to think about each investment decision but while people are putting more new money into 401 k plans a lot of that cash will wind up in an ira eventually when leaving jobs workers can choose to retain the tax deferral on their accounts by rolling the money into an ira in fact ira dollar volumes have been boosted much more by rollovers in recent years than by new contributions new life for municipal bonds for tax minimization in the bond world municipal bonds reign supreme the interest paid by bonds issued by states cities counties and other municipalities typically skirts federal taxes and sometimes taxes in the state where the bonds were issued too no wonder they re popular in fact investors pumped a net 11 billion into municipal bond mutual funds in february a recent high water mark reported the investment company institute job market stuck in a part time job there s lots of full time jobs out there if you want one municipal bonds typically yield less than treasurys corporates and other bonds whose interest is taxed at the federal level but many people still like them especially during periods when interest rates are stable and especially among investors in high tax brackets investment firm columbia threadneedle notes that municipal bonds historically have fared well during periods of slowing economic growth they re also fairly price stable without subjecting investors to often wild rides these bonds have generated positive returns including interest income in 31 of the past 35 years the company said one caveat to beware while the interest is generally tax free you must report it to calculate whether some of your social security benefits might be taxable assuming you re collecting social security as many municipal bond investors are travel boeing to slow production of 737 max as it continues working on software fix regular stocks low tax rates possible there s much be said for owning stocks outside of an ira or 401 k account in a non sheltered brokerage account you would face taxes on any dividends received but you could delay any capital gains until you sell also losses on money losing stocks potentially are deductible when your net investment losses exceed your gains in a given year you can apply up to 3 000 of those losses against regular income and carry unused losses to future

americans will face a 15 capital gain rate while for lower income people no capital gain taxes would be due the tax implications of stock mutual funds is more tricky as you could receive a tax bill reflecting trades made by the portfolio manager even if you didn t do any buying or selling yourself you also would face taxes on dividends earned on the fund s holdings that s why various tax advantaged mutual funds could be a smart choice the managers of these funds strive to avoid taxable gains by minimizing trades and by avoiding dividend paying stocks index funds feature some of the

are some caveats as a homeowner you may deduct mortgage interest and property taxes subject to the new 10 000 household cap on state and local taxes including property taxes tax reform capped the mortgage interest deduction for high priced homes with big mortgages but most middle class owners won t notice any difference there s another less obvious but potentially huge tax break for homeowners who hang onto their properties for a while if you own and occupy a home for at least two of the five years prior to selling it you can avoid up to 250 000 in gains if single or 500 000 in gains if married filing a joint return conversely you can t deduct losses on primary residences there s an expanded set of tax breaks if you own rental real estate expenses incurred to maintain the property can be deducted including repairs management costs property taxes and mortgage interest you also receive and must report depreciation a non cash charge that reflects the gradual loss of value on buildings but not land even if they don t actually lose value depreciation reduces the tax bite on rental properties while you own them but eventually this money must be repaid or recaptured after you

by bloomberg investors were on edge a year ago for signs the u s labor market was overheating now they re primed for the opposite while friday s jobs report is expected to show payrolls rebounded in march following the weakest reading since 2017 economists forecast a 180 000 gain that would be a moderation from last year s average as business investment slows and headwinds gather bond investors are wary that the falloff could be sharper this year with markets reflecting bets that a recession is looming and the federal reserve will play defense by cutting interest rates it s a huge shift from early 2018 when accelerating wage gains spurred financial market turmoil amid concern the fed would raise rates more aggressively with inflation muted and economic growth cooling those concerns have faded and the central bank has scrapped expectations for rate hikes this year while it monitors how the u s weathers a global slowdown if payrolls miss expectations people are going to say we ve had two consecutive weak numbers maybe growth is probably losing some momentum said alex li head of u s rates strategy at credit agricole in new york that could reignite fears of recession and wipe out this week s increase in treasury rates taking the u s 10 year yield back toward its late march low li said the labor market is set to take a step back this year as the effects of tax cuts fade companies find fewer workers and cooling global growth filters into investment decisions the question now is how quickly and how hard this shift happens with the march data setting the trend after a february that economists largely discount as an anomaly due to weather and data collection disruptions a private report on wednesday showed u s companies in march added the fewest jobs in 18 months a possible sign of weakening the question going into this report more than others in the past is what the underlying pace is people are talking about a potential recession concerns and uncertainties and we haven t had the normal flow of data so far this year said stephen stanley chief economist at amherst pierpont securities who forecasts a payroll gain of 210 000 there s uncertainty about the economy while a confluence of domestic and external factors is depressing the economy s performance we expect most of the issues to be temporary and are therefore wary of being overly pessimistic about the overall outlook and job growth bloomberg economists yelena shulyatyeva tim mahedy and eliza winger said traders and investors will likely treat a weaker than forecast payrolls figure as vindication for bets that a recession is closer than thought market expectations for the fed to cut interest rates at least once this year have grown and in march the gap between 3 month and 10 year rates inverted for the first time since 2007 while such a shift is seen as a harbinger of recession subsequent moves have since restored the 10 year note s yield premium a weak report would also be a major blow to risk appetite according to jason celente senior fixed income portfolio manager at insight investment it would upend the recent bad news is good news sentiment whereby stocks and credit traders have benefited from weaker data because it suggested the fed would ease to maintain overall economic strength now that strength is being questioned the 10 year rate which dipped as low as 2 34 percent late last month is currently 2 51 percent marginally above the top of the fed s target range for overnight cash even with the move in treasuries stock investors have shown some optimism the s p 500 index has continued to rally this week after capping its best quarterly surge since 2009 one sector seeing mixed prospects is manufacturing the institute for supply management survey of factories topped estimates in the month led by a jump in the employment component but the adp research institute s report showed the biggest drop in such jobs since 2016
loading and it s a pity we haven t started earlier because once we no longer had a vehicle manufacturing industry to protect then you would have thought we could start to raise our standard for vehicle emissions australia has become what many describe as a dumping ground for the world s dirtiest cars the result of poor quality fuel and a lack of any vehicle emissions standards putting us behind countries like china turkey and india the carbon dioxide co2 emissions intensity for passenger cars in australia is 45 per cent worse than in europe the national transport commission found a lack of incentives for electric cars means that they now constitute just 0 2 per cent of new purchases in australia yet they approach nearly half of all new sales in norway it comes as the united nations is warning that australia is off track to meet its commitment under the 2015 international paris agreement to limit the warming of the planet to well below 2 degrees celsius above pre industrial levels wood said that in order to achieve australia s emissions target the country must reduce pollution to around 146 million tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2030 which is 22 per cent lower than the most recent projection for 2030 labor s clean car policy to help boost the number of electric car sales by 2030 labor wants half of government fleet cars to be electric by 2025 businesses buying new electric cars over 20 000 will get a 20 per cent tax deduction but it s not clear when this would kick in these changes which make up the final tranche of the party s climate change platform include a 200 million fund to roll out 200 fast charging stations labor also pledged to introduce the country s first fuel emissions standard in line with 105 grams of co2 per kilometre for light vehicles which is consistent with the us standards but behind the european union s technician norman bell works on an electric truck in dandenong south credit joe armao the standard would require car makers to increase their supply of energy efficient cars in australia to ensure that on average their car emissions do not surpass the new limit but the party held off on setting a date for this standard choosing to first consult with industry the move was celebrated by an array of green groups and the automotive electrical sector tony fairweather who is the chief executive of sea electric a growing victorian based business company that electrifies trucks said labor s promises were positive to see an electric waste management truck at sea electric s dandenong south facility credit joe armao sea electric and charging station companies tritium and jet charge are among the businesses labor hopes will help form a new car manufacturing industry fairweather who is setting up a factory in the regional town of morwell that will employ 500 people said he chose to invest in australia s green transport future despite the absence of subsidies because we ve got global expertise we see what happens in other developed countries and it s embarrassing the lack of support and incentives that a developed country like australia is offering every other developed market that we are in and even some undeveloped markets like thailand and indonesia have some form of electric vehicle incentives australia right now has none greens candidate adam bandt with an electric car credit ken irwin the greens said labor s policy doesn t go far enough and reaffirmed their call for 100 per cent of new car purchases to be electric by 2030 the liberals said the opposition had no plan for replacing the shortfall in fuel excise revenue and warned the emissions standard will push up the price of station wagons and utes by nearly 5000 the government has promised it will develop its own electric vehicle policy i don t know what tradies are going to do under labor s policies because there is no car that can do what they need to do that they can drive energy minister angus taylor said fuel excise research organisation bloomberg new energy finance estimated that the revenue loss in fuel excise could range from about 1 billion to 5 billion a year by 2030 in the scheme of things it doesn t break the bank wood said but noted that new road charges or taxes on charging stations were obvious revenue replacements the end result is there will be a cost there which you will have to pay for that people are not necessarily yet aware of half of cars to go electric is it achievable there s nothing scientific about that number wood said of the electric vehicle target it s a marketing slogan a hyundai ioniq at a charging station infrastructure australia has identified a nationwide fast charging network as a high priority according to wood the target alone is meaningless unless the vehicles are made affordable and adequate charging infrastructure is supplied to encourage people to buy them right now electric cars in australia are expensive and limited in range just four models are under 60 000 the cheapest is the hyundai ioniq hybrid priced at 40 000 charging stations remain relatively scarce melbourne has just 11 stations per 1 million people and sydney had 15 compared with 43 in new york 28 in singapore and 64 in london an analysis by mapping company here technologies shows in order for electric cars to make up 50 per cent of new sales the australian renewable energy agency suggested that the states could consider waiving stamp duty and car registration on electric vehicles it might seem implausible but consider that the act has removed stamp duty and applied a 20 per cent discount on registration fees for electric vehicles it now outperforms all other jurisdictions in its electric vehicle takeup other recommendations include abolishing the luxury car tax and giving electric vehicles access to bus lanes what you will pay the australian automobile association warned that penalising car makers for selling dirty cars risked pushing up vehicle prices chief executive michael bradley called for emissions standards that factor in australians preference for gas guzzling suvs and light commercial utes kia chief operating officer damien meredith hopes to be selling electric cars in australia by the end of 2019 credit peter braig if we get it wrong we face significant potential costs by way of car price rises and petrol price rises he warned however government data shows that extra up front costs in purchasing fuel efficient cars are dramatically offset by the savings in fuel it costs just a few dollars to fill a tank at home while many charging stations on the street are free the australia institute s senior economist matt grudnoff said that until electric vehicles reach price parity this is expected to occur as early as 2024 they should be subsidised by the government the best thing we can do is subsidise early on and tailor it off as there is more and more uptake until eventually it vanishes we just need to overcome a market failure so that electric cars can compete evenly and the cheaper option will win out the power grid in his national electricity market review chief scientist alan finkel found a 20 per cent electric vehicle uptake could account for four per cent of grid demand a 100 per cent uptake could increase demand to 20 per cent as the cars become more popular a key challenge will be discouraging motorists from charging them during peak demand the australian energy market operator aemo has called for smart metering that allows for time of use tariffs finding that by 2050 one in three people using an electric car will choose to charge them during the busiest period at the end of the work day electric cars can produce less pollution if the electricity is produced by renewables toyota or tesla which one is greener taylor warned that electric cars can be the same or more polluting than some light vehicles he is not alone finkel also highlighted that the emissions released by a large tesla are just slightly less than a toyota corolla wood said these comparisons were literally true for electric cars powered by coal right now however he pointed out that as the country continues to invest in renewable energy the benefits of electric vehicles would follow
by this time of the year you probably have already filed your income tax return or have the finish line in sight and through it all you probably have asked yourself what else can i do to shave the tax bite on my investment portfolio actually there s a lot that can be done as several types of investments offer at least modest tax shaving potential and for the most part these investment tax benefits weren t undercut by tax reform these are some of the more popular choices iras plenty of versatility individual retirement accounts aren t a type of investment but rather a type of account into which you can place all sorts of stuff and receive tax benefits all iras offer tax deferred growth of your investment dollars after that things get more complex but also more beneficial with traditional iras you essentially can deduct the money you put into an account then as noted it builds up tax deferred until you withdraw it when your contributions and gains are taxed as ordinary income if you withdraw money prematurely generally before age 59 ½ you face a 10 penalty you also need to start taking withdrawals by around age 70 ½ or an even bigger 50 penalty could apply one nice thing about iras you typically can make a contribution as late as april 15 and apply the deduction to reduce your tax bill for the prior year fidelity investments reports that 33 of all the 2018 ira contributions made by its customers came in during the three weeks leading up to the april 15 deadline with roth iras the tax benefits are reversed you don t get a deduction up front but you also don t pay taxes on withdrawals assuming you meet minimum holding period requirements with roths there are also no required minimum distributions starting around 70 ½ matches boost 401 k accounts as good as iras can be more contributions have been flowing into workplace 401 k style retirement accounts from a tax standpoint 401 k plans work like traditional iras in that you get a deduction on contributions your gains build up tax free then you face regular taxes on withdrawals many employers also offer a roth 401 k option meaning you would forsake the deduction but your withdrawals would come out tax free several factors explain why 401 k s are popular matching funds are a big one as many employers will encourage you to save by pitching in perhaps 50 cents for every dollar you invest up to certain limits also the accounts are convenient in that the money is diverted automatically from each paycheck without you having to think about each investment decision but while people are putting more new money into 401 k plans a lot of that cash will wind up in an ira eventually when leaving jobs workers can choose to retain the tax deferral on their accounts by rolling the money into an ira in fact ira dollar volumes have been boosted much more by rollovers in recent years than by new contributions new life for municipal bonds for tax minimization in the bond world municipal bonds reign supreme the interest paid by bonds issued by states cities counties and other municipalities typically skirts federal taxes and sometimes taxes in the state where the bonds were issued too no wonder they re popular in fact investors pumped a net 11 billion into municipal bond mutual funds in february a recent high water mark reported the investment company institute municipal bonds typically yield less than treasuries corporates and other bonds whose interest is taxed at the federal level but many people still like them especially during periods when interest rates are stable and especially among investors in high tax brackets investment firm columbia threadneedle notes that municipal bonds historically have fared well during periods of slowing economic growth they re also fairly price stable without subjecting investors to often wild rides these bonds have generated positive returns including interest income in 31 of the past 35 years the company said one caveat to beware while the interest is generally tax free you must report it to calculate whether some of your social security benefits might be taxable assuming you re collecting social security as many municipal bond investors are regular stocks low tax rates possible there s much be said for owning stocks outside of an ira or 401 k account in a non sheltered brokerage account you would face taxes on any dividends received but you could delay any capital gains until you sell also losses on money losing stocks potentially are deductible when your net investment losses exceed your gains in a given year you can apply up to 3 000 of those losses against regular income and carry unused losses to future years even when you do sell stocks at a gain the goal of course you would face reasonably low capital gain rates on long term positions held more than one year while high earners can pay 20 most americans will face a 15 capital gain rate while for lower income people no capital gain taxes would be due the tax implications of stock mutual funds is more tricky as you could receive a tax bill reflecting trades made by the portfolio manager even if you didn t do any buying or selling yourself you also would face taxes on dividends earned on the fund s holdings that s why various tax advantaged mutual funds could be a smart choice the managers of these funds strive to avoid taxable gains by minimizing trades and by avoiding dividend paying stocks index funds feature some of the same tax shaving benefits mainly because they don t engage in a lot of tax triggering selling real estate lots of breaks few mainstream investments feature as many tax breaks as real estate but there are some caveats as a homeowner you may deduct mortgage interest and property taxes subject to the new 10 000 household cap on state and local taxes including property taxes tax reform capped the mortgage interest deduction for high priced homes with big mortgages but most middle class owners won t notice any difference there s another less obvious but potentially huge tax break for homeowners who hang onto their properties for a while if you own and occupy a home for at least two of the five years prior to selling it you can avoid up to 250 000 in gains if single or 500 000 in gains if married filing a joint return conversely you can t deduct losses on primary residences there s an expanded set of tax breaks if you own rental real estate expenses incurred to maintain the property can be deducted including repairs management costs property taxes and mortgage interest you also receive and must report depreciation a non cash charge that reflects the gradual loss of value on buildings but not land even if they don t actually lose value depreciation reduces the tax bite on rental properties while you own them but eventually this money must be repaid or recaptured after you sell reach wiles at russ wiles arizonarepublic com or 602 444 8616 support local journalism subscribe to azcentral

the peso is expected to weaken versus the dollar today following the better than expected jobs report in the united states on friday the peso ended the week at p52 10 against the greenback up eight centavos than thursday s p52 18 driven by dovish cues from the bangko sentral ng pilipinas despite a slower than expected march inflation print week on week the peso also strengthened from the p52 50 finish last march 29 in an e mail a market analyst said the dollar will likely bounce back against the local currency on monday after the us economy added more jobs than expected in march the us job market expanded by 196 000 in march the bureau of labor statistics reported on the other hand the unemployment rate was steady last month at 3 8 sitting below the 5 upper threshold considered as strong by the us federal reserve the dollar s appreciation due to these relatively strong us labor reports might be amplified by safe haven buying amid lingering concerns on brexit and the us china trade talks the market analyst added meanwhile rizal commercial banking corp economist michael l ricafort said there might be some upward correction for the dollar peso to the p52 20 per greenback levels after stronger us jobs data and possible monetary easing after lower than expected inflation inflation stood at 3 3 in march the philippine statistics authority reported on friday easing for the fifth straight month and near the lower end of the 3 1 3 9 forecast range of the central bank the bangko sentral ng pilipinas hinted that any cut on local policy rates or reserve requirements may not be immediate mr ricafort said as monetary easing will only be considered if inflation goes down further to 3 the market analyst expects the peso to trade between p51 90 and p52 60 this week while mr ricafort said the peso could range from p51 80 p52 20 today meanwhile the department of finance said the local unit tracked its southeast asian peers in gaining strength versus the us dollar for the first quarter year to date the peso appreciated by a modest 0 01 while the outlook for the peso remains tilted towards the downside owing to a growing current account deficit which in turn is on account of increased importation of capital goods the country s external stance remains generally strong the finance department said in an economic bulletin the generally strong stance of the country against headwinds offshore was attributed to ample buffers as well as trimmed exposure to external debt karl angelo n vidal
it seems to be well appreciated among by policymakers and investors that the system is ill prepared to cope with another financial crisis it is understandable that so many are concerned that the end of the business cycle could trigger a financial crisis in practice it seems like it has worked the other way around the financial crisis triggered the great recession the economy previously contracted when the tech bubble popped similar thinking emerged after wwii the fear of a return to the pre existing depression conditions and the threat of the spread of communism shaped both the domestic and foreign policy objectives stimulative policies and a stable monetary order bretton woods reduced trade barriers gatt and the world bank and imf were to assist development and external imbalances the causes and triggers of the equity market slide in q4 may not be fully understood but policymakers have been spooked by the tightening of financial conditions and the loss of economic momentum the federal reserve went from balance sheet reduction and rate hikes in december to a neutral stance even before the ecb staff revised its economic forecasts draghi had changed the risk assessment a new targeted loan facility will be forthcoming and there is increased talk in tiering the deposit rate with the idea in mind to lower the cost of negative interest rates two different things may be at work here first simply the consideration of tiering means that negative rates will last longer until now the ecb officially has implied that the negative interest rates are working and generating little secondary damage however the longer it goes the risks would seem to rise moreover given the contraction in the germany economy in q3 18 and the flattish figure for q4 perhaps germany needs some of the same stimulus that italy can use second it could be a way to keep the creditor nations on side the long term loan facility is understood to benefit the debtors in southern europe who especially relied on the past tltro operations a tiering of the negative deposit rate would help those with the deposits namely the creditors like germany and the netherlands germany s manufacturing remains challenging it declined in march 0 2 for the fifth time in six months the external sector appears to be the main drag it was what pushed factory orders into contraction germany export driven economy was hit with three shocks the slowing of china brexit and turkey the challenges to its diesel heavy auto sector did not help matters however the strength of retail sales and construction suggest the domestic economy has some traction the ecb meets on april 11 the focus will be on two elements the forward guidance and any details on the terms of the new tltro there is talk that the ecb would extend its commitment not to lift interest rates the challenge here is that president draghi steps down later this year and it is impolitic to handcuff his successor for too long the terms of engagement for the new loan facility may not be ready until june in some ways since the bulk of the funds will likely be used to repay previous borrowings there is not much urgency now even if it may impact net stable funding ratio metrics in h2 there are two other considerations here first the euro has fallen on days the ecb has met with one exception since the start of last year this is not technical it is fundamental for most of this period the ecb has been dealing with an economic slowdown and has been dovish second german france and italy have revised down gdp forecasts since the 2019 budgets were approved by the eu slower growth means larger deficits as a percentage of gdp which in turn may require remedial action such as a vat increase in italy the early animosity between the populist nationalist italian government and the ec has been dialed back and neither are questioning the other s legitimacy the league is poised to do well in the eu parliament elections at the end of next month there is no need for drama the drama maybe not from the ecb as much as from the ongoing theatric tragedy of brexit the house of commons could not agree on any alternative course but did manage to see a majority instruct the prime minister to seek an extension in brussels meanwhile may had reached out to labour to see if a resolution could be found the talks apparently have not gone anywhere when an extension was requested it was for the end of june ostensibly this is before the next ec takes office though after the eu parliament election previously it seems clear that may was told by brussels that the next request for an extension should be a long one as they had no interest in repeated extensions this would be the second an eu summit late next week that will decide the general sense was that the shortest extension that many officials see is a year besides disappointing those who had hoped the uk would be out of the eu by now and extending the economic and financial uncertainty such an extension would require the uk to participate in the eu parliament elections and other eu decision making procedures could anyone do that in good faith ii that inversion of the us yield curve three month to 10 year that caused so much consternation never mind it finished the week with a positive slope of a little more than 10 basis points the two year to 10 year spread also steepened slightly while the us jobs data were not spectacular they were solid there were 196k net new jobs created in march underscoring that the revised 33k increase from 20k in february the unemployment rate remained at 3 8 despite the decline in the participation rate the day before the national figures weekly jobless claims fell to new 50 year lows there were some troubling elements like a loss of 6k manufacturing jobs the risk here is some observers will blame the strong dollar instead of lagging capital investment and boosting productivity earnings growth disappointed as it slowed to 3 2 year over year from 3 4 however this was partly driven by another element of good news the work week expanded to 34 5 from 34 4 hours an increase in the work week often sees a decline in average hourly earnings the participation rate fell to 63 0 from 63 2 the labor force declined by almost 225k it is tempting to write this off as the baby boomers retiring but something else is at work or not as the case may be the participation by 34 44 year old men ties a record low set in the 1950s the important takeaway from the employment data is that it is not signaling a recession calls for a 50 bp rate cut or trump s call to restart quantitative easing seem far from the fed s thinking no sitting fed president or governor has endorsed those calls we correctly anticipated the fed officials to push back justify their neutrality short term real interest rates in the us are still negative the fed s wait and see posture will be on display in the fomc minutes that will be released on april 10 a few hours before the minutes the us will release march cpi figures our green shoots hypothesis also requires that disinflation pressure ease headline cpi is expected to firm from 1 5 in february to 1 8 in march the core rate needs to rise by 0 2 after a 0 1 increase in february to keep the year over year rate at 2 1 separately import prices are also expected to continue to firm with a 0 4 gain following february s 0 6 increase import prices had fallen 1 3 year over year in february and march may have seen the decline pared to 0 4 a big part of the story is oil prices light sweet crude oil wti for may delivery finished 2018 near 46 a barrel it traded a whisker away from 63 a barrel this nears an important technical retracement of the decline in q4 18 despite trump s plea to boost output opec is showing discipline meanwhile later this month the administration will announce if the exemptions to the iranian oil embargo will be extended the most likely scenario seems to not to renew all the exemptions those that did not use them would be low hanging fruit without altering supply the more dangerous shot across the bow were reports suggesting that if the us revokes opec s exemption from its anti trust lows as some in congress continue to press saudi arabia threatened to accept payment for its oil in currencies other than the us dollar while the bill has been debated since 2000 trump s criticism of opec and his support for the bill in a 2011 book has revived such efforts qatar quit opec last year ostensibly because of the us threat last year the saudis sold about 356 bln of oil if it did come to it some of saudis assets in america would also likely be sold the saudis own roughly 1 trillion of us assets including around 160 bln in us treasuries iii our green shoots hypothesis requires the chinese economy to find better traction the pmis were one piece of the puzzle the next pieces may fall into place in the coming days aggregate lending should recover strongly if chinese officials had what we called a draghi moment and have committed themselves to strengthen the economy and avoid the loss of face associated with economic weakness under the pressure of us tariffs and the 70th anniversary of the revolution more telling is at the next level of detail a pro growth policy may create room again for shadow banking in february shadow banking contracted which is to say that new yuan loans exceeded aggregate financing it ought not in march separately price pressures likely picked up consumer prices may have accelerated to 2 3 in march from 1 5 in february the cpi finished last year at 1 9 but averaged 2 1 producer prices collapsed alongside energy prices in q4 18 from a 3 3 year over year pace in october to 0 1 in january and february producer prices are expected to have edged higher in march one of the startling transformations underway is the rise of the chinese consumer according to reports in 2007 china s consumption was 1 25 of the world as of 2017 it was a tenth while the rise of china is well known we suspect the rise of india is not fully appreciated india surpassed france last year to move into the sixth spot in world gdp this year it will push past the uk to move into fifth behind the us china japan and germany india s month long national elections begin at the end of the week ahead foreign investors have flocked to india this year investing over 8 bln in equities and 500 mln in indian bonds
jack rasmus professor of economics says whereas the tax paid by wealthy us businesses is cut by trillions of dollars average workers at best stagnated with most experiencing a decline in real wages while the rate of inflation is rising for rents medical education _________ fars american economist trump s policies creating growing gap in income wealth opportunity in america dr rasmus believes the us president bragged about wage gains of the average and low paid us workers as more than half of them have reportedly received no wage gains in 2018 jack rasmus ph d political economy is an author journalist and radio host he was an economist and market analyst for several international companies and us unions below is the full text of the interview conducted by fna q the us has been experiencing higher gdp under president trump in the last 2 years is this economic growth shared with average or low paid americans a the trump tax cuts passed in early 2018 amounted to more than 4 5 trillion over the decade to wealthy households businesses investors and corporations which have been front loaded in 2018 offsetting this are 1 5 trillion in tax hikes for wage earners that begins to hit this year and accelerates after 2022 assumptions about 3 gdp growth for another decade with no recession produces a further offsetting of 1 or more the result is the 1 5 trillion reported by the press the 4 5 trillion cuts for business and investors have not gone into real investment and generated the trump 2017 18 gdp growth rates real investment in structures and equipment declined steadily over 2018 as the trump tax cuts took effect measured in percent terms compared to the preceding quarter residential construction was negative every quarter in 2018 commercial construction with a lag turned negative in the second half of 2018 and equipment spending fell from 8 5 in the first quarter to 3 4 by october 2018 so if the trump tax cuts did not go into real investment creating real

largest companies in the us will reach a record 1 3 trillion in 2018 add the largest 2000 or 5000 companies and its close to 2 trillion hundreds of billions more for m a this diversion of the trump tax cuts to financial markets is the main determinant driving stock markets even after corrections and other financial asset markets the government grossly over reports wage gains for the average and low paid workers in the us an independent source reports show that more than half of us workers received no wage gain at all in 2018 the official reported wage gains of 3 are skewed to the top 10 of the labor force and moreover the data is for full time employed only so average workers at best stagnated with most experiencing a decline in real wages the rate of inflation in the us is under estimated for median worker family households and inflation is rising for rents medical education and other major items in household budgets so the immediate future will mean even less real wage gains for the majority of us workers if they were doing so well as trump and even the press report why is it that 7 million of them have defaulted on their auto loans and why is credit card auto loans and education loan debt now all over 1 trillion each q the us has a population of over 325 million people with undocumented immigrants estimated to be somewhere around 10 to 12 million people who are mainly the lowest paid workers do you believe in president trump s claim of immigrants invading american economy a immigrants are certainly not invading the 10 12 million number has been stable for several years and for immigrants for some countries like mexico the numbers are in sharp decline it is true that more immigrants are coming from central american countries like honduras salvador and guatemala but that is due to the economic crises and violent breakdown of the social order in those countries which is due largely to us support for the corrupt elites of those countries who encourage the gang violence in their countries and do nothing about the economic crises if there is a problem with immigration in the us it is a problem of highly educated tech workers being brought in on h1 b and l 1 visas and rich asians who can buy themselves a green card residency by promising to spend 50 000 when they come these groups are taking the real jobs the high paying tech and other professional jobs and have been since the 1990s but trump is agreeing with the us tech companies to keep bringing them in taking jobs us workers should and could get trump s immigration policy and draconian action against immigrants from latin america and elsewhere is about his re election plans in 2020 by creating enemies within and outside the us he diverts his political base from the real problems of america blame the foreigner in our midst has always been a useful fascist argument and trump is marching down that road as witnessed in his latest constitutional power grab by declaring national emergencies to build his wall and invoking phony national security to justify his trade wars q donald trump represents the capitalist economy which has not worked well for the majority of americans do you believe the widening gap between the rich and the poor in his era can boost americans interest in socialism a the income and wealth gaps in the us are not only widening but doing so at an accelerating pace us neoliberal policy under obama was to subsidize capital incomes through federal reserve cheap money and by extending and expanding his predecessor george w bush tax cuts for business and investors trump policy has accelerated the tax cuts and now stopped the fed from raising interest rates the direct consequence is booming stock and corporate bond markets fed by 1 trillion annual stock buybacks and dividend payouts every year since 2011 now at record 1 3 trillion in 2018 as wage incomes for the 90 of americans remain stagnant barely rise or decline the direct consequence is accelerating income inequality and wealth gaps will this boost interest in socialism it already has a clear majority well over 60 of people aged 34 and younger in the work force have indicated in various recent polls that they prefer socialism over capitalism it s not by accident therefore that trump and the us business press has been launching an offensive to attack the idea of socialism once again this shift in public opinion will continue as the trump policies continue to create a growing gap in income wealth and opportunity in america

by this time of the year you probably have already filed your income tax return or have the finish line in sight and through it all you probably have asked yourself what else can i do to shave the tax bite on my investment portfolio actually there s a lot that can be done as several types of investments offer at least modest tax shaving potential and for the most part these investment tax benefits weren t undercut by tax reform these are some of the more popular choices iras plenty of versatility individual retirement accounts aren t a type of investment but rather a type of account into which you can place all sorts of stuff and receive tax benefits all iras offer tax deferred growth of your investment dollars after that things get more complex but also more beneficial with traditional iras you essentially can deduct the money you put into an account then as noted it builds up tax deferred until you withdraw it when your contributions and gains are taxed as ordinary income getting an extension how to file an extension on taxes ira mistakes to avoid social security ira and tax mistakes to avoid when planning retirement if you withdraw money prematurely generally before age 59½ you face a 10 penalty you also need to start taking withdrawals by around age 70½ or an even bigger 50 penalty could apply one nice thing about iras you typically can make a contribution as late as april 15 and apply the deduction to reduce your tax bill for the prior year fidelity investments reports that 33 of all the 2018 ira contributions made by its customers came in during the three weeks leading up to the april 15 deadline with roth iras the tax benefits are reversed you don t get a deduction up front but you also don t pay taxes on withdrawals assuming you meet minimum holding period requirements with roths there are also no required minimum distributions starting around 70½ matches boost 401 k accounts as good as iras can be more contributions have been flowing into workplace 401 k style retirement accounts from a tax standpoint 401 k plans work like traditional iras in that you get a deduction on contributions your gains build up tax free then you face regular taxes on withdrawals many employers also offer a roth 401 k option meaning you would forsake the deduction but your withdrawals would come out tax free several factors explain why 401 k s are popular matching funds are a big one as many employers will encourage you to save by pitching in perhaps 50 cents for every dollar you invest up to certain limits also the accounts are convenient in that the money is diverted automatically from each paycheck without you having to think about each investment decision but while people are putting more new money into 401 k plans a lot of that cash will wind up in an ira eventually when leaving jobs workers can choose to retain the tax deferral on their accounts by rolling the money into an ira in fact ira dollar volumes have been boosted much more by rollovers in recent years than by new contributions new life for municipal bonds for tax minimization in the bond world municipal bonds reign supreme the interest paid by bonds issued by states cities counties and other municipalities typically skirts federal taxes and sometimes taxes in the state where the bonds were issued too no wonder they re popular in fact investors pumped a net 11 billion into municipal bond mutual funds in february a recent high water mark reported the investment company institute job market stuck in a part time job there s lots of full time jobs out there if you want one municipal bonds typically yield less than treasurys corporates and other bonds whose interest is taxed at the federal level but many people still like them especially during periods when interest rates are stable and especially among investors in high tax brackets investment firm columbia threadneedle notes that municipal bonds historically have fared well during periods of slowing economic growth they re also fairly price stable without subjecting investors to often wild rides these bonds have generated positive returns including interest income in 31 of the past 35 years the company said one caveat to beware while the interest is generally tax free you must report it to calculate whether some of your social security benefits might be taxable assuming you re collecting social security as many municipal bond investors are travel boeing to slow production of 737 max as it continues working on software fix regular stocks low tax rates possible there s much be said for owning stocks outside of an ira or 401 k account in a non sheltered brokerage account you would face taxes on any dividends received but you could delay any capital gains until you sell also losses on money losing stocks potentially are deductible when your net investment losses exceed your gains in a given year you can apply up to 3 000 of those losses against regular income and carry unused losses to future years even when you do sell stocks at a gain the goal of course you would face reasonably low capital gain rates on long term positions held more than one year while high earners can pay 20 most americans will face a 15 capital gain rate while for lower income people no capital gain taxes would be due the tax implications of stock mutual funds is more tricky as you could receive a tax bill reflecting trades made by the portfolio manager even if you didn t do any buying or selling yourself you also would face taxes on dividends earned on the fund s holdings that s why various tax advantaged mutual funds could be a smart choice the managers of these funds strive to avoid taxable gains by minimizing trades and by avoiding dividend paying stocks index funds feature some of the same tax shaving benefits mainly because they don t engage in a lot of tax triggering selling real estate lots of breaks few mainstream investments feature as many tax breaks as real estate but there are some caveats as a homeowner you may deduct mortgage interest and property taxes subject to the new 10 000 household cap on state and local taxes including property taxes tax reform capped the mortgage interest deduction for high priced homes with big mortgages but most middle class owners won t notice any difference there s another less obvious but potentially huge tax break for homeowners who hang onto their properties for a while if you own and occupy a home for at least two of the five years prior to selling it you can avoid up to 250 000 in gains if single or 500 000 in gains if married filing a joint return conversely you can t deduct losses on primary residences there s an expanded set of tax breaks if you own rental real estate expenses incurred to maintain the property can be deducted including repairs management costs property taxes and mortgage interest you also receive and must report depreciation a non cash charge that reflects the gradual loss of value on buildings but not land even if they don t actually lose value depreciation reduces the tax bite on rental properties while you own them but eventually this money must be repaid or recaptured after you

loading and it s a pity we haven t started earlier because once we no longer had a vehicle manufacturing industry to protect then you would have thought we could start to raise our standard for vehicle emissions australia has become what many describe as a dumping ground for the world s dirtiest cars the result of poor quality fuel and a lack of any vehicle emissions standards putting us behind countries like china turkey and india the carbon dioxide co2 emissions intensity for passenger cars in australia is 45 per cent worse than in europe the national transport commission found a lack of incentives for electric cars means that they now constitute just 0 2 per cent of new purchases in australia yet they approach nearly half of all new sales in norway it comes as the united nations is warning that australia is off track to meet its commitment under the 2015 international paris agreement to limit the warming of the planet to well below 2 degrees celsius above pre industrial levels wood said that in order to achieve australia s emissions target the country must reduce pollution to around 146 million tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2030 which is 22 per cent lower than the most recent projection for 2030 labor s clean car policy to help boost the number of electric car sales by 2030 labor wants half of government fleet cars to be electric by 2025 businesses buying new electric cars over 20 000 will get a 20 per cent tax deduction but it s not clear when this would kick in these changes which make up the final tranche of the party s climate change platform include a 200 million fund to roll out 200 fast charging stations labor also pledged to introduce the country s first fuel emissions standard in line with 105 grams of co2 per kilometre for light vehicles which is consistent with the us standards but behind the european union s technician norman bell works on an electric truck in dandenong south credit joe armao the standard would require car makers to increase their supply of energy efficient cars in australia to ensure that on average their car emissions do not surpass the new limit but the party held off on setting a date for this standard choosing to first consult with industry the move was celebrated by an array of green groups and the automotive electrical sector tony fairweather who is the chief executive of sea electric a growing victorian based business company that electrifies trucks said labor s promises were positive to see an electric waste management truck at sea electric s dandenong south facility credit joe armao sea electric and charging station companies tritium and jet charge are among the businesses labor hopes will help form a new car manufacturing industry fairweather who is setting up a factory in the regional town of morwell that will employ 500 people said he chose to invest in australia s green transport future despite the absence of subsidies because we ve got global expertise we see what happens in other developed countries and it s embarrassing the lack of support and incentives that a developed country like australia is offering every other developed market that we are in and even some undeveloped markets like thailand and indonesia have some form of electric vehicle incentives australia right now has none greens candidate adam bandt with an electric car credit ken irwin the greens said labor s policy doesn t go far enough and reaffirmed their call for 100 per cent of new car purchases to be electric by 2030 the liberals said the opposition had no plan for replacing the shortfall in fuel excise revenue and warned the emissions standard will push up the price of station wagons and utes by nearly 5000 the government has promised it will develop its own electric vehicle policy i don t know what tradies are going to do under labor s policies because there is no car that can do what they need to do that they can drive energy minister angus taylor said fuel excise research organisation bloomberg new energy finance estimated that the revenue loss in fuel excise could range from about 1 billion to 5 billion a year by 2030 in the scheme of things it doesn t break the bank wood said but noted that new road charges or taxes on charging stations were obvious revenue replacements the end result is there will be a cost there which you will have to pay for that people are not necessarily yet aware of half of cars to go electric is it achievable there s nothing scientific about that number wood said of the electric vehicle target it s a marketing slogan a hyundai ioniq at a charging station infrastructure australia has identified a nationwide fast charging network as a high priority according to wood the target alone is meaningless unless the vehicles are made affordable and adequate charging infrastructure is supplied to encourage people to buy them right now electric cars in australia are expensive and limited in range just four models are under 60 000 the cheapest is the hyundai ioniq hybrid priced at 40 000 charging stations remain relatively scarce melbourne has just 11 stations per 1 million people and sydney had 15 compared with 43 in new york 28 in singapore and 64 in london an analysis by mapping company here technologies shows in order for electric cars to make up 50 per cent of new sales the australian renewable energy agency suggested that the states could consider waiving stamp duty and car registration on electric vehicles it might seem implausible but consider that the act has removed stamp duty and applied a 20 per cent discount on registration fees for electric vehicles it now outperforms all other jurisdictions in its electric vehicle takeup other recommendations include abolishing the luxury car tax and giving electric vehicles access to bus lanes what you will pay the australian automobile association warned that penalising car makers for selling dirty cars risked pushing up vehicle prices chief executive michael bradley called for emissions standards that factor in australians preference for gas guzzling suvs and light commercial utes kia chief operating officer damien meredith hopes to be selling electric cars in australia by the end of 2019 credit peter braig if we get it wrong we face significant potential costs by way of car price rises and petrol price rises he warned however government data shows that extra up front costs in purchasing fuel efficient cars are dramatically offset by the savings in fuel it costs just a few dollars to fill a tank at home while many charging stations on the street are free the australia institute s senior economist matt grudnoff said that until electric vehicles reach price parity this is expected to occur as early as 2024 they should be subsidised by the government the best thing we can do is subsidise early on and tailor it off as there is more and more uptake until eventually it vanishes we just need to overcome a market failure so that electric cars can compete evenly and the cheaper option will win out the power grid in his national electricity market review chief scientist alan finkel found a 20 per cent electric vehicle uptake could account for four per cent of grid demand a 100 per cent uptake could increase demand to 20 per cent as the cars become more popular a key challenge will be discouraging motorists from charging them during peak demand the australian energy market operator aemo has called for smart metering that allows for time of use tariffs finding that by 2050 one in three people using an electric car will choose to charge them during the busiest period at the end of the work day electric cars can produce less pollution if the electricity is produced by renewables toyota or tesla which one is greener taylor warned that electric cars can be the same or more polluting than some light vehicles he is not alone finkel also highlighted that the emissions released by a large tesla are just slightly less than a toyota corolla wood said these comparisons were literally true for electric cars powered by coal right now however he pointed out that as the country continues to invest in renewable energy the benefits of electric vehicles would follow
minister jordan tells islamic development bank guyana has asked the islamic development bank isdb to consider investing in three mini hydropower systems and road links in hinterland communities finance minister winston jordan said in his address at the 44th annual meeting of the islamic bank group in marrakesh morocco the country has also made a pitch for the isdb to invest in the construction of several potable water and sanitation systems a reverse linkage programme in halal ecosystems and a reverse linkage programme in technical and vocational training the latter will place emphasis on addressing the critical needs of the emerging oil and gas sector minister jordan said the proposals have been made at a time when the isdb is working with guyana to develop an appropriate development agenda as well as a plan of action and implementation guyana looks to the esteemed president of this august institution and his skilled and hard working staff to support our ambitious programmes and we look to your respected excellencies to formulate the policies to support the work of the isdb among its member countries he said the finance minister noted that there are thousands of years of experience and tested technologies that exist in this region from which guyana and other member states can benefit in the pipeline are opportunities for a waqf investment programme to support our elder care initiatives highway construction to open thousands of hectares of agricultural land while linking communities and markets and marine port development to improve shipping and competitiveness the finance minister said tremendous support since guyana became a member of the isdb in 2016 the country has received tremendous support in 2018 three operations were approved enabling guyana to benefit from a grant to upgrade and modernise the palms a us 20m installment sale operation to expand and upgrade the electricity transmission and distribution system thereby leading to improvement in the quality and reliability of the energy supply received by customers and a reverse linkage programme funded by malaysia us 0 3m the isdb us 0 28m and guyana a matching amount to make the rice industry more resilient productive and competitive additionally in 2018 guyana received a programming mission to begin preparation for several new projects to respond to the current challenges that are rooted in insufficient national resources and a diminishing pool of multilateral and bilateral support noting that guyana is open for business the finance minister told the islamic bank group that the country looks forward to its development partners including the isdb to build on its regional comparative advantage in natural resource endowment including pristine forests abundant fresh water large arable agricultural lands and a wide variety of flora fauna and mineral resources he noted that guyana s strategic geo physical and geo political location within latin america and the caribbean offers a convenient gateway for public and private sector partners to collaborate and invest thereby expanding their market opportunities and access scarce resources he said to realise its potential it is imperative for the country to develop its climate resilient infrastructure and food and energy security he said the country also needs an empowered and skilled labour force and increased capacity for entrepreneurship innovation and creativity inconvenient truths meanwhile on the global front minister jordan told the world leaders that since the last annual meeting there have been some inconvenient truths of globalisation s free trade agreements which have become more evident the developed economies have championed trade without attention to people and trade arrangements have been extended into national borders with the consequential reshaping of domestic regulations and the appropriation of indigenous knowledge for profit he said he said now the world begins to reap the whirlwind of a global marketplace that bypasses distributional justice with disruptions in geopolitical stability and defaults on agreements to govern the global commons we see fragmentation instead of collaboration and unity and the rise of a chauvinistic brand of nationalism he stated minister jordan told the isdb member states that it is clear that business as usual will not suffice we must applaud the vision of the president who is steering the islamic bank group on a path that recognises the importance of the environment and to building partnerships and south south relations towards the realisation of economies that are resilient that champion trade with the awareness that people are central to all our policies programmes and actions and that address labour market failures by targeting job creation and global value chains he added these programmes and financial instruments of the isdb will not deepen societal divisions nor undermine domestic social bargains in the way that implementing current world trade organisation wto and banking rules seem to be doing he urged the isdb and its partners and member states to find ways for countries to

no one knows what china s future holds and there is a long history of faulty predictions of systemic collapse or stagnation conventional wisdom exaggerates china s strength cambridge chinese president xi jinping seems to be on a roll he has sent a rocket to the dark side of the moon built artificial islands on contested reefs in the south china sea and recently enticed italy to break ranks with its european partners and sign on to china s belt and road initiative meanwhile us president donald trump s unilateralist posture has reduced america s soft power and influence china s economic performance over the past four decades has been truly impressive it is now the main trading partner for more than a hundred countries compared to about half that number for the united states its economic growth has slowed but its official six percent annual rate is more than twice the american rate conventional wisdom projects that china s economy will surpass that of the us in size in the coming decade perhaps but it is also possible that xi has feet of clay no one knows what china s future holds and there is a long history of faulty predictions of systemic collapse or stagnation while i don t think either is likely the conventional wisdom exaggerates china s strengths westerners see the divisions and polarization in their democracies but china s successful efforts to conceal its problems cannot make them go away sinologists who know much more than i do describe at least five major long term problems confronting china five problems first there is the country s unfavorable demographic profile china s labor force peaked in 2015 and it has passed the point of easy gains from urbanization the population is aging and china will face major rising health costs for which it is poorly prepared this will impose a significant burden on the economy and exacerbate growing inequality second china needs to change its economic model in 1978 deng xiaoping wisely switched china from maoist autarky to the east asian export led growth model successfully pioneered by japan and taiwan today however china has outgrown the model and the tolerance of foreign governments that made it possible for example us trade representative robert lighthizer is focusing on the lack of reciprocity subsidies to state owned enterprises soes and coerced intellectual property transfer that have allowed china to tilt the playing field in its favor europeans are also complaining about these issues moreover china s intellectual property policies and rule of law deficiencies are discouraging foreign investment and costing it the international political support such investment often brings and china s high rates of government investment and subsidies to soes disguise inefficiency in the allocation of capital third while china for more than three decades picked the low hanging fruit of relatively easy reforms the changes it needs now are much more difficult to introduce an independent judiciary rationalization of soes and liberalization or elimination of the hukou system of residential registration which limits mobility and fuels inequality moreover deng s political reforms to separate the party and the state have been reversed by xi that brings us to the fourth problem ironically china has become a victim of its success the leninist model imposed by mao in 1949 fit well with chinese imperial tradition but rapid economic development has changed china and its political needs china has become an urban middle class society but its ruling elites remain trapped in circular political reasoning they believe that only the communist party can save china and thus that any reforms must strengthen the party s monopoly on power but this is exactly what china does not need deep structural reforms that can move china away from reliance on high levels of government investment and soes are opposed by party elites who derive tremendous wealth from the existing system xi s anti corruption campaign can t overcome this resistance instead it is merely discouraging initiative on a recent visit to beijing a chinese economist told me that xi s campaign cost china one percent of

increasing the party s role finally there is china s soft power deficit xi has proclaimed a chinese dream of a return to global greatness as economic growth slows and social problems increase the party s legitimacy will increasingly rest on such nationalist appeals over the past decade china has spent billions of dollars to increase its attractiveness to other countries but international public opinion polls show that china has not gained a good return on its investment repressing troublesome ethnic minorities jailing human rights lawyers creating a surveillance state and alienating creative members of civil society such as the renowned artist ai weiwei undercut china s attraction in europe australia and the us power and weakness such policies may not hurt china s reputation in some authoritarian states but modern authoritarianism is not ideologically based the way communism was decades ago young revolutionaries around the world were inspired by mao s teachings today although xi jinping thought on socialism with chinese characteristics has been enshrined in the party constitution few young people in other countries are carrying that banner china is a country with great strengths but also important weaknesses american strategy should avoid exaggerating either china will increase in importance and the us china relationship will be a cooperative rivalry we must not forget either part of that description no country including china is likely to surpass the us in overall power in the next decade or two but the us will have to learn to share power as china and others gain strength by maintaining its international alliances and domestic institutions america will have a comparative advantage joseph s nye is a professor at harvard his forthcoming book is do

don t even mention the recession the experts fear is coming just feel grateful for varadkar s tax cuts writes gene kerrigan what do you think about what s happening with the yield curve in some parts of the world the parts with the big offices the sharp suits and the ridiculous salaries and bonuses these days they re a bit worried about the yield curve why because it s inverted which means the lights will soon be burning through the night at the department of finance because varadkar even as he continues posing for every possible photo op is worried the days when investors made decisions on the basis of experience and instinct are long gone today decisions about vast amounts of money are made scientifically investment companies and banks employ regiments of analysts the government departments that serve the companies and banks have some too these are mostly young people who came out of the womb tapping their calculators they provide their ultimate masters investment firms and other professional gamblers with reams of analysis this includes mathematical papers loaded with charts graphs tables and footnotes and of all their statistical tools none is more significant for investment firms and other professional gamblers than the yield curve what is the yield curve if i invest a million dollars for three months i ll get xpc interest yield from the financial markets if i invest a million for a whole year i ll get a higher yield and if i invest it for 10 years i get an even higher yield the yield curve is a line on a chart it tracks the hour by hour relationship between the interest rates offered for investments of various lengths of time three months a year two years and so on this line is usually one that gently ascends rarely the figures will show that you ll get a higher yield on a short term investment than you ll get on a long term investment when this happens the term used is that the yield curve has inverted this explanation is very basic there are all sorts of curves within curves around october of last year the yield curve indicated possible problems but no one was too worried the yield curve that matters most is the one that shows the relationship between the rates of yield from money invested for 10 years and money invested for three months and a couple of weeks ago this curve inverted this meant you d get more for your million if you invested short term indicating falling confidence and rising instability why does this matter because over the past 50 years or so every economic recession was signalled by such a yield curve inversion it s not an immediate link it takes time to play out an inversion in 1973 was followed by a recession six months later there was a 17 month gap after the inversion that signalled the coming recession in 2008 the average gap between inversion and recession over 50 years was 12 months and to make things more uncertain there were a couple of false positives over those 50 years inversions that were not followed by recessions so the stats say there ll probably be a recession in early 2020 give or take a few months these are american statistics but the global nature of the economy ensures recession rapidly spreads the european economy is in worse shape and the chinese economy has everyone worried the brits think they re up shit creek now wait till they notice they re drifting into excrement ocean what complicates everything is that states everywhere are chin deep in the debt created to prop up the private financial system after the 2008 crash so first these matters are commonplace among the rich and those who serve them they re discussed in the more esoteric sections of the business media but not in front of those who will take most of the pain of a recession us in september 2008 when citizens went on liveline to say there seemed to be problems with the banks the department of finance got on to rte which immediately shut down the discussion these things are not for us to talk about ours not to wonder why ours but to suffer the pay cuts service cuts and job closures since it involves our jobs and living standards though it s worth knowing and since most of the economists work directly or otherwise for the investment companies and banks we have to try to work it out for ourselves knowing about these things matters if you re negotiating a contract say it s a pay rise you may find the employer offering some now and more later when a recession hits inability to pay kicks in demand it now as in 2008 we can expect the rich forewarned by their economic analysts to quietly hide various assets as they anticipate the recession secondly look around just as the pre 2008 boom came and went and major social problems were left unsolved so it is today over ten thousand homeless and that s just the most obvious part of the housing crisis there are 611 982 people in substandard accommodation people live with their parents long after they want to people couch surf with their friends government priority is to ensure the vultures are happy as a result a united nations report notes that landlords have become faceless corporations wreaking havoc with tenants airbnb has converted masses of apartment housing to the tourist trade individual investors and big companies profit and tourists get cheaper accommodation homelessness grows one in five people pay over 40pc of their disposable income on accommodation one in 20 spend over 75pc we have the worst public hospital waiting lists in europe there are 542 000 people waiting to see specialists one in nine of the population the target for hospital waiting lists is an incredible 18 months and they re failing to meet it as a result 216 500 have waited over nine months for a first contact and 100 000 are waiting 18 months the government response is to use various tricks to prune the waiting lists for housing and for hospitals just as it artificially pruned the unemployment figures don t deal with the problems fiddle with the figures to pretend the problem is being dealt with it s 13 years since a national emergency was declared in the country s a e system and there are still over 500 regularly waiting overnight on trolleys not to worry profits are soaring the rich are siphoning off vast amounts of our hard earned wealth ratcheting up the price of a roof over our heads charging outrageous professional fees and designing the loopholes the state provides for them to wriggle out of their taxation responsibilities word has long been out the irish state will help you plunder the citizens and when a recession hits we ll be told we demanded too much public spending just as in 2008 in the face of all the evidence ff told us we all partied and fg said we went mad and they got away with it leo varadkar is committed to major tax cuts to consolidate the fg base for the coming election to continue with this when the warning bells are ringing about a probable recession would be deliberate economic sabotage for short term political gain but right wing politicians are as committed to tax cuts as they are to holding the jackets of the profiteers while they shake us down for every spare cent just don t mention the yield curve inversion
court records from stephen moore s divorce paint president donald trump s nominee for the federal reserve board as a brazen philanderer who openly talked about his mistress in front of his kids and then continued shorting his ex wife on tens of thousands of dollars in alimony and child support even after a judge held him in contempt of court i have two women and what s really bad is when they fight over you moore said to the couple s children in front of his former wife allison at their son s graduation ceremony court records claim other court records show moore who is a distinguished visiting fellow at the conservative heritage foundation has a 75 000 irs tax lien against him for unpaid taxes on his 2014 filing the lien relates to a deduction he took for both alimony and child support to his ex wife he has said he is contesting that amount despite that and the revelations from the moores divorce trump continues to back moore s nomination to the fed according to a senior white house official who spoke to cnbc potus is completely behind him that official said in an email using the acronym for president of the united states the conduct by moore a conservative economist as alleged by his former wife stands in sharp contrast to his publicly published positions on marriage what is irrefutable is that marriage with a devoted husband and wife in the home is a far better social program than food stamps medicaid public housing or even all of them combined moore wrote in a 2014 washington times article in which he contended the nation s economic success would depend on a culture of virtue strong families and parents and a resurgence of the protestant work ethic name a government program that can take the place of a father but more than three years before that moore was not acting like a devoted husband allison moore said in a divorce action filed in august 2010 after two decades of marriage and then when the couple split she claimed he did not pay her or their three children what he had agreed to she said it was only after a judge s contempt order and a threat in that order to have moore arrested so he could purge that contempt that he began paying alimony and child support allison and stephen moore on monday both issued statements using friendly language about each other with allison saying they had reconciled through our divorce a nomination already under fire trump on march 22 said he would nominate moore to the fed s board of governors after he read a wall street journal column moore had co authored entitled the fed is a threat to growth the column slammed the hike in interest rates by the central bank in the latter half of 2018 which moore claimed was preventing the economy from maximizing the growth it should be realizing from trump s financial policies moore who was an adviser to trump s 2016 president campaign and co wrote the 2018 book trumponomics inside the america first plan to revive our economy in december had called for fed chairman jerome powell to resign after the central bank increased interest rates moore s position on interest rates dovetails with that of trump s annoyance with powell and the fed while trump has called moore a very respected economist not everyone in the economics field is nearly so impressed with him greg mankiw a conservative who headed the council of economic advisers under president george w bush said in a blog post that moore lacked the intellectual gravitas for the fed post an npr article about the nomination quoted the university of michigan s justin wolfers saying of moore more than possibly any other economist in modern america he has a track record of getting the big issues wrong not just occasionally but time after time after the financial crisis in 2008 moore had predicted incorrectly that low interest rates set by the fed to encourage a recovery would lead to high inflation he also assisted with the plan to slash income taxes in kansas under gov sam brownback which resulted in the state s bond rating being cut and revenue falling hundreds of millions of dollars the center on budget and policy priorities noted in may 2017 that was the same year the gop controlled state legislature overrode brownback s veto and undid his tax cuts when trump formally submits moore s nomination to the senate the senate banking committee will be responsible for reviewing moore s nomination and for forwarding it for a vote to the full senate the majority republican committee has yet to schedule a hearing for moore the spokeswoman for the committee s majority noted that moore has yet to be formally nominated she also noted that committee chairman sen mike crapo r idaho has said it s a priority to fill every seat on the board and that it will receive prompt attention the spokeswoman had no comment on the details of moore s divorce and financial dispute with his ex wife the ranking democrat on the banking committee sen sherrod brown ofohio said last week when asked about moore i don t see him as a qualified person to be on the fed the details surrounding moore s divorce contained in fairfax county virginia court files may make his path to confirmation even trickier the guardian newspaper first reported saturday about details of the moores divorce and the fact that a judge in fairfax county had held stephen moore in contempt of court for failing to pay allison more than 300 000 in alimony child support and the balance of their divorce settlement moore was first found in contempt of a court order by a judge in november 2012 in march 2013 a judge issued another order demanding he purge himself of his contempt by paying allison what he had agreed to under their settlement months later he avoided a court ordered sale of his house by paying allison 217 000 toward his arrearage of more than 333 300 a bitter end and then a reconciliation on monday the guardian posted online the case records it used for its original report hours after cnbc broke the news that the file had been sealed to public inspection at allison s request in december 2009 allison claimed stephen moore created two accounts on the dating web site match com the sole purpose of which was to connect romantically with other women after meeting and dating at least one other woman through those accounts stephen moore by his own admission commenced a romantic adulterous relationship with sherri wallmark by february 2010 court records state moore was neither discreet nor inconspicuous with his relationship with ms wallmark allison claimed in her divorce action in fact he tastelessly and openly spoke with on several occasions about plans and events he was attending with ms wallmark allison also claimed stephen left documents around their house related to his relationship with wallmark including bills showing extravagant dinners charges for gasoline purchased near wallmark s home and an airline ticket bought by stephen with wallmark listed as a passenger allison s complaint said she saw a t shirt that stephen had bought for wallmark with the nike logo and the words doing it wallmark in an interview with cnbc denied knowing moore when he was married although she did not deny having been in a relationship with him in the past that s not true wallmark said when told that allison had accused stephen moore of committing adultery with wallmark his ex wife is literally nuts allison moore s lawyer david roop declined to comment on wallmark s remarks she said in court records that she had been a good and dutiful wife to stephen but that she has suffered emotional and psychological abuse from him throughout their marriage allison moore said in her filing that in the fall of 2009 she had no other option but to leave the marital home with the youngest of their three children then aged 8 to protect herself from defendant and his influence on their two older kids her intent she said was to give stephen space to allow him to get help and change his behavior at the time she wrote she hoped she would be able to reconcile with him since then has neither altered his behavior towards nor ended his adulterous affair the complaint said allison s complaint called her the primary caretaker and role model for their children stephen on the other hand has recently acted indifferent towards their children and was providing little or no supervision to their two older sons who were living with him in the marital residence the complaint said in a may 2011 filing by stephen he wrote that he admits all the allegations in allison s complaint since the divorce however the two have reached an understanding allison moore and i were married for 19 years and have three wonderful sons whom we have co parented stephen moore said in a statement provided to cnbc our divorce was settled amicably many years ago and we remain on friendly terms to this day she is a terrific mother and i hold her in the highest regard he added allison our kids and my current wife would hope that the media would please respect our privacy i am happy to speak to the media on any matters related to the economy or my views on the fed allison moore in a statement released by stephen s spokeswoman said steve moore and i reconciled through our divorce many years ago and we would hope the media would respect our privacy we remain on cordial terms

open this photo in gallery u s president donald trump in las vegas nevada u s april 6 2019 kevin lamarque reuters politicians have had strong opinions on what the u s federal reserve should and shouldn t do throughout its 105 year history they have pushed for lower interest rates and easier money or for this or that policy on bank regulation or consumer protection they have summoned fed leaders to the white house or congress to persuade and cajole in that sense there is nothing new in president donald trump s aggressive approach to the fed this week he called for lower interest rates and new quantitative easing and he signaled an intention to appoint two vocal supporters stephen moore and herman cain to the board of governors what makes mr trump s approach to the fed so unusual is that he has repeatedly publicly undermined a fed chief he appointed jerome powell and if successful he would put two officials with a background in partisan politics in the inner sanctum of fed policymaking mr moore was founder of the club for growth which supports conservative candidates for office and mr cain ran for president it s more overtly political than anything we ve seen since at least the 80s and historically when we ve had political appointments and interventions in the fed there have been unintended consequences that last said julia coronado president of macropolicy perspectives and a former fed staffer it may be expedient in the near term but what s good for the next year or two may not be good for the next decade all presidential appointees to the fed s board of governors come with their own political point of view which generally dovetails with the president who appointed them but typically they have also brought deep technical expertise and an inclination to keep political dimensions out of fed debates people around the table did have political views and i did too said alan blinder who was appointed vice chairman of the fed by then president bill clinton and is more recently the author of advice and dissent about the role of politicians versus technocrats in shaping policy but you weren t supposed to bring them into the room when it was time to make a decision and people didn t that is the tradition that mr trump s approach endangers you can read thousands of pages of transcripts of closed door fed policy meetings without seeing a reference to the political jockeying that occupies the rest of washington three times in recent decades a president has reappointed a fed chairman first named by a president of the opposite party ronald reagan with paul volcker mr clinton with alan greenspan and barack obama with ben bernanke you will see no political bumper stickers in the underground parking garage when dan tarullo an obama campaign veteran and a banking expert was named a governor in 2009 there was some tut tutting among staff that he initially left his sticker on in effect the risk is that the fed becomes yet another partisan battlefield as is often the case with the supreme court nomination process congressional intelligence oversight committees and regulators like the federal communications commission in the immediate future this probably wouldn t mean much for policy if nominated and confirmed mr moore and mr cain would hold two of 12 votes on the federal open market committee their ability to sway the fed toward mr trump s desired interest rate cuts and a new round of quantitative easing would depend on their ability to persuade their new colleagues it will be their task to convince the others that their way of thinking about monetary policy will improve the fed s ability to meet its legislative mandates for maximum employment and stable prices said don kohn a former fed vice chairman who was appointed by george w bush that will require solid economic analysis backed up by research the risk of more overt political divisions within the fed would come over time if the fed came to be seen as basing decisions on the political impulses of appointees rather than on sound economic analysis the united states role as the global reserve currency which results in persistently low interest rates and little fear of capital flight is built in significant part on the credibility the fed has accumulated over decades during the global financial crisis and its aftermath for example the fed could feel comfortable pursuing efforts to stimulate the u s economy without a loss of faith in the dollar and treasury bonds by global investors the u s dollar actually rose against other currencies even as the economy was in free fall in late 2008 and the fed deployed trillions of dollars in unconventional programs to try to stop the crisis the hazards of a more politicized fed are evident from the experience of the early 1970s when richard nixon used both political pressure and underhanded tactics to try to push the fed chairman arthur burns to keep interest rates low heading into the 1972 election among other things the white house leaked a false story that mr burns sought a large pay raise at a time the fed was pressuring employers not to increase wages to fight inflation mr burns and the fed followed the president s wishes and mr nixon won re election handily in 1972 amid a booming economy but it was in those years that inflationary pressures were building in the economy and within a few years the rate of inflation reached double digits no one would argue that the fed is divorced from politics it is constantly making decisions that pit the interests of workers against owners of capital and those of banks against those of consumers but there is a difference between acknowledging that there are choices that must be informed by political values and putting those political values ahead of what are often highly technical discussions in senate confirmation hearings would mr moore and mr cain adopt the cautious careful language typical of central bankers or embrace a role as partisan warriors the safest bet is that investors around the world will be watching carefully for hints of just how politicized the fed of the future will turn out to be

it seems to be well appreciated among by policymakers and investors that the system is ill prepared to cope with another financial crisis it is understandable that so many are concerned that the end of the business cycle could trigger a financial crisis in practice it seems like it has worked the other way around the financial crisis triggered the great recession the economy previously contracted when the tech bubble popped similar thinking emerged after wwii the fear of a return to the pre existing depression conditions and the threat of the spread of communism shaped both the domestic and foreign policy objectives stimulative policies and a stable monetary order bretton woods reduced trade barriers gatt and the world bank and imf were to assist development and external imbalances the causes and triggers of the equity market slide in q4 may not be fully understood but policymakers have been spooked by the tightening of financial conditions and the loss of economic momentum the federal reserve went from balance sheet reduction and rate hikes in december to a neutral stance even before the ecb staff revised its economic forecasts draghi had changed the risk assessment a new targeted loan facility will be forthcoming and there is increased talk in tiering the deposit rate with the idea in mind to lower the cost of negative interest rates two different things may be at work here first simply the consideration of tiering means that negative rates will last longer until now the ecb officially has implied that the negative interest rates are working and generating little secondary damage however the longer it goes the risks would seem to rise moreover given the contraction in the germany economy in q3 18 and the flattish figure for q4 perhaps germany needs some of the same stimulus that italy can use second it could be a way to keep the creditor nations on side the long term loan facility is understood to benefit the debtors in southern europe who especially relied on the past tltro operations a tiering of the negative deposit rate would help those with the deposits namely the creditors like germany and the netherlands germany s remains challenging it declined in march 0 2 for the fifth time in six months the external sector appears to be the main drag it was what pushed into contraction germany export driven economy was hit with three shocks the slowing of china brexit and turkey the challenges to its diesel heavy auto sector did not help matters however the strength of and construction suggest the domestic economy has some traction the meets on april 11 the focus will be on two elements the forward guidance and any details on the terms of the new tltro there is talk that the ecb would extend its commitment not to lift interest rates the challenge here is that president draghi steps down later this year and it is impolitic to handcuff his successor for too long the terms of engagement for the new loan facility may not be ready until june in some ways since the bulk of the funds will likely be used to repay previous borrowings there is not much urgency now even if it may impact net stable funding ratio metrics in h2 there are two other considerations here first the has fallen on days the ecb has met with one exception since the start of last year this is not technical it is fundamental for most of this period the ecb has been dealing with an economic slowdown and has been dovish second and have revised down gdp forecasts since the 2019 budgets were approved by the eu slower growth means larger deficits as a percentage of gdp which in turn may require remedial action such as a vat increase in italy the early animosity between the populist nationalist italian government and the ec has been dialed back and neither are questioning the other s legitimacy the league is poised to do well in the eu parliament elections at the end of next month there is no need for drama the drama maybe not from the ecb as much as from the ongoing theatric tragedy of brexit the house of commons could not agree on any alternative course but did manage to see a majority instruct the prime minister to seek an extension in brussels meanwhile may had reached out to labour to see if a resolution could be found the talks apparently have not gone anywhere when an extension was requested it was for the end of june ostensibly this is before the next ec takes office though after the eu parliament election previously it seems clear that may was told by brussels that the next request for an extension should be a long one as they had no interest in repeated extensions this would be the second an eu summit late next week that will decide the general sense was that the shortest extension that many officials see is a year besides disappointing those who had hoped the uk would be out of the eu by now and extending the economic and financial uncertainty such an extension would require the uk to participate in the eu parliament elections and other eu decision making procedures could anyone do that in good faith ii that inversion of the us yield curve to that caused so much consternation never mind it finished the week with a positive slope of a little more than 10 basis points the to 10 year spread also steepened slightly while the us were not spectacular they were solid there were 196k net new jobs created in march underscoring that the revised 33k increase from 20k in february the remained at 3 8 despite the decline in the the day before the national figures fell to new 50 year lows there were some troubling elements like a loss of 6k manufacturing jobs the risk here is some observers will blame the instead of lagging capital investment and boosting productivity earnings growth disappointed as it slowed to 3 2 year over year from 3 4 however this was partly driven by another element of good news the work week expanded to 34 5 from 34 4 hours an increase in the work week often sees a decline in the participation rate fell to 63 0 from 63 2 the labor force declined by almost 225k it is tempting to write this off as the baby boomers retiring but something else is at work or not as the case may be the participation by 34 44 year old men ties a record low set in the 1950s the important takeaway from the employment data is that it is not signaling a recession calls for a 50 bp rate cut or trump s call to restart quantitative easing seem far from the fed s thinking no sitting fed president or governor has endorsed those calls we correctly anticipated the fed officials to push back justify their neutrality short term real interest rates in the us are still negative the fed s wait and see posture will be on display in the that will be released on april 10 a few hours before the minutes the us will release march figures our green shoots hypothesis also requires that disinflation pressure ease headline cpi is expected to firm from 1 5 in february to 1 8 in march the needs to rise by 0 2 after a 0 1 increase in february to keep the year over year rate at 2 1 separately import prices are also expected to continue to firm with a 0 4 gain following february s 0 6 increase import prices had fallen 1 3 year over year in february and march may have seen the decline pared to 0 4 a big part of the story is oil prices light sweet wti for may delivery finished 2018 near 46 a barrel it traded a whisker away from 63 a barrel this nears an important technical retracement of the decline in q4 18 despite trump s plea to boost output opec is showing discipline meanwhile later this month the administration will announce if the exemptions to the iranian oil embargo will be extended the most likely scenario seems to not to renew all the exemptions those that did not use them would be low hanging fruit without altering supply the more dangerous shot across the bow were reports suggesting that if the us revokes opec s exemption from its anti trust lows as some in congress continue to press saudi arabia threatened to accept payment for its oil in currencies other than the us dollar while the bill has been debated since 2000 trump s criticism of opec and his support for the bill in a 2011 book has revived such efforts qatar quit opec last year ostensibly because of the us threat last year the saudis sold about 356 bln of oil if it did come to it some of saudis assets in america would also likely be sold the saudis own roughly 1 trillion of us assets including around 160 bln in us treasuries iii our green shoots hypothesis requires the chinese economy to find better traction the pmis were one piece of the puzzle the next pieces may fall into place in the coming days aggregate lending should recover strongly if chinese officials had what we called a draghi moment and have committed themselves to strengthen the economy and avoid the loss of face associated with economic weakness under the pressure of us tariffs and the 70th anniversary of the revolution more telling is at the next level of detail a pro growth policy may create room again for shadow banking in february shadow banking contracted which is to say that new yuan loans exceeded aggregate financing it ought not in march separately price pressures likely picked up consumer prices may have accelerated to 2 3 in march from 1 5 in february the finished last year at 1 9 but averaged 2 1 collapsed alongside energy prices in q4 18 from a 3 3 year over year pace in october to 0 1 in january and february producer prices are expected to have edged higher in march one of the startling transformations underway is the rise of the chinese consumer according to reports in 2007 china s consumption was 1 25 of the world as of 2017 it was a tenth while the rise of china is well known we suspect the rise of india is not fully appreciated india surpassed france last year to move into the sixth spot in world gdp this year it will push past the uk to move into fifth behind the us china japan and germany india s month long national elections begin at the end of the week ahead foreign investors have flocked to india this year investing over 8 bln in equities and 500 mln in indian

saudi arabia threatened to use the nuclear option of undermining the petro dollar if the u s moves forward with the nopec bill the u s congress has been mulling legislation known as the nopec bill which would allow the justice department to take antitrust action against opec for manipulating the oil market specifically the bill would remove sovereign immunity countries have from such action allowing the u s government to sue in theory the law would prevent opec from coordinating production cuts it s still unclear if the congress will pass the bill and it s also not guaranteed that trump will sign the bill if it reaches his desk moreover even if he did sign it it s also not a done deal that the justice department would take punitive action nevertheless saudi arabia clearly views the threat as a serious one reuters reports that saudi arabia has threatened to sell its oil in currencies other than the u s dollar if the bill becomes law such a move would have enormous implications the global oil market is almost entirely conducted in dollars which provides the foundation for dollar domination in the global financial system introducing new currencies in the oil trade could undercut demand for the dollar diminish american influence over global finance weaken american influence over sanctions and thus undercut its geopolitical reach it s hard to assess how serious saudi arabia is but the implications of such a move are far reaching and hard to overstate the saudis know they have the dollar as the nuclear option a source familiar with the matter told reuters another source put it this way the saudis say let the americans pass nopec and it would be the u s economy that would fall apart some version of the nopec legislation has floated around for years but past u s presidents from both parties have opposed the measure over fears that it would damage the u s saudi relationship this time around the situation is different for several reasons first saudi arabia has seriously damaged its standing in washington through its war in yemen and over the murder of saudi journalist jamal khashoggi with goodwill evaporating its grip on the u s congress has weakened related what s next for algeria as bouteflika steps down the house and senate just passed a bill that cuts off u s aid for the saudi war in yemen a historic rebuke to saudi arabia as well as a historic move to weaken the american executive branch s authority over war president trump will likely veto the bill but a few years ago such a vote was unthinkable saudi arabia s missteps contributed greatly to the passage of the bill another reason why the odds of nopec becoming law are greater than ever are because of the unpredictable nature of trump himself he has embraced the saudi government but he also uses opec as a punching bag although the saudis to a large degree control opec decisions they are distinct entities in trump s mind only a few days ago he tweeted very important that opec increase the flow of oil world markets are fragile price of oil getting too high thank you to the extent that oil prices are high and trump feels that gasoline prices become a political liability he may feel more compelled to sign a nopec bill that brings us back to the saudi threat to undermine the dollar if riyadh actually carried out such a threat to switch away from the dollar for oil sales which is definitely not a sure thing it would have some eager partners china russia iran and even the european union have all at times supported some alternative to the dollar based international order the trump administration s excessive use of sanctions and its bullying of key allies in europe have many governments ready for currency substitutes as reuters notes russia has tried to sell oil in euros while china setup a yuan denominated oil contract in shanghai to rival the dollar iran has also eagerly tried to promote oil sales in other currencies in order to skirt u s sanctions the eu setup a special purpose vehicle to help european companies continue to do business with iran and it also recently set up a working group to promote the euro as an alternative to the dollar related the energy solution that could end the border wall debate to date those efforts have done little to undercut dollar domination but a saudi decision to diversify away from the dollar would be the most powerful move yet however there are plenty of reasons why this scenario won t play out the bill may not pass the u s congress to begin with but even if it became law the saudis have plenty of obstacles standing in their way not the least of which is their currency peg with the dollar riyadh is also dependent on the u s military alliance and dumping the dollar would put that in jeopardy those reasons alone might deter saudi arabia from moving forward with currency alternatives advertisement a separate threat which is arguably more doable from the saudi standpoint would be to produce oil at maximum levels to crash prices opec officials have reportedly been telling wall street executives that they would be forced to take such action if the nopec bill becomes law nopec legislation won t serve the u s interest opec secretary general mohammad barkindo said in march in houston at the ceraweek conference by nick cunningham of oilprice com more top reads from oilprice com
