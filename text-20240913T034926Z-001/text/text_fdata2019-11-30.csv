we are protesting against problems in the whole system a young chilean protester said on tv in november above all the neoliberal system the increasing cost of everyday life drove more than a million people from numerous world capitals into the street in october chilean protesters fought cops as buses were torched ecuadorians used satellite dishes as shields against police tear gas in lebanon people barricaded roads and held mass sit ins at state buildings since july throngs of haitians and iraqis frustrated at government corruption filled the streets even braving sniper fire and pulling down razor wire blockades the protests in the global south reinforce those in the global north like france s yellow vests and spain s indignados now a possibility is emerging a vision of a new internationalism that could upend nearly 50 years of neoliberalism class war the chilean who threw a rock at an armored police van also struck the half century ideology of neoliberalism even as today governments send police in riot gear to defend that economic ideology it s worth remembering that it was first promoted by its authors as a way to protect individuals against the state although the state intervention they were worried about at the time involved services and support that helped millions the idea of neoliberalism took shape during the great depression and after world war ii when economists milton friedman and friedrich hayek watched in growing dismay at collectivism or state intervention in the economy in the 1930s president franklin d roosevelt dealt with labor strikes and widespread poverty by turning john keynes s ideas of government spending to stimulate a moribund economy into the new deal in 1945 britain facing a mass demobilization of soldiers and a people tired of war time austerity created a large welfare state the u s s r was a superpower rivaling the west so friedman hayek and others met in 1947 at hotel du parc and formed the mont pelerin society to fight keynesianism and marxism they believed the more power the state took the less the individual had until it ended in totalitarianism hayek wrote in his 1944 book the road to serfdom to achieve their ends planners must create power power over men wielded by men democracy is an obstacle to this suppression of freedom he and friedman saw big government as a potential enemy of the people it had to be kept small they said it had to be limited or it would turn on us neoliberalism was a fringe idea ignored until it became a useful tool for capitalists to reassert dominance in the 1970s economic convulsions from the 1973 oil crisis and stagflation scared the ruling class david harvey in his 2005 book a brief history of neoliberalism wrote in the u s the control of wealth by the top 1 percent of the population had remained fairly stable but in the 1970s it plunged the upper classes had to protect themselves they seized the ideas of hayek and friedman and put them into practice with the election of ronald reagan in the u s and margaret thatcher in the u k neoliberalism became a hammer for the global north to discipline domestic and international labor fueling the fire the great depression produced massive suffering said marxist economist richard wolff in an interview with truthout there was a right and left wing reaction both wanted to radically reorganize society it ended in a victory of the left with the new deal and social democracy in europe but they left the capitalists in the same position with every incentive to undo all the social programs just put in place it s like defeating an enemy but leaving them weapons n a replay of history late 20th and 21st century neoliberalism repeated the mistakes of the laissez faire economics that led to the great depression the top 1 percent pursued class dominance through market fundamentalism in the u s the price of neoliberalism was a growing social divide and people falling between the cracks it was pushed by republicans and democrats from president carter deregulating trucking trains and airlines to reagan who cut taxes for the rich and cut welfare to clinton who cut welfare established the north american free trade agreement and removed the glass steagall act the untold effects culminated in the 2008 great recession which nearly melted the world economy and led to occupy wall street outside the u s the price of neoliberalism was state terror and dire poverty in 1973 the u s backed a coup against socialist chilean president salvador allende which led to the killing of thousands of leftists chileans who studied under friedman restructured the economy it deepened inequality in haiti the u s backed dictators papa doc duvalier and his son baby doc who stole the nation s wealth and rained down terror a popular uprising threw baby doc out in 1986 but the u s returned in 2004 to force in a neoliberal friendly regime in july 2018 the haitian government raised fuel taxes on an already desperately poor people in 2003 the u s invaded iraq and the coalition provisional authority ran the war torn country through the neoliberal gauntlet by eliminating taxes privatizing 200 state run companies and later privatizing the oil iraq was left in ruins in 2017 ecuador s newly elected president lenin moreno vowed to continue the leftist program of his predecessor and subsidize the poor instead he took a hard neoliberal turn and declared a cut to gas subsidies new taxes and labor reforms to meet the terms of an international monetary fund loan in 2019 lebanon s government leviednew taxes on whatsapp gas and cigarettes neoliberalism whether through the ballot or the bullet has ripped up the post world war ii social contract and left nations teetering on the edge of collapse every time someone lost a job or faced a price hike every time a person felt shame at being unable to afford a decent life tension rose and simmered state capitals floated on an invisible sea of gasoline vulnerable to a spark in ecuador haiti lebanon and chile the sparks flew one after another from a new tax to a bus fare hike to the removal of gas subsidies the new internationalism are we seeing the rise of a new left internationalism is it possible that working class people will struggle together against the common enemy of neoliberalism can they unite across national borders race and religion if so the time to strike is now today s capitalism is in a vulnerable in between state corporations are leaving the global north in search of cheaper labor in the global south and in doing so creating a sense of betrayal among citizens in the former and anger at being exploited in the latter wolff told truthout by the 1970s with the introduction of jets and the internet it was possible for capital to leave the old centers in the global north and go to mexico china or the global south and there you see a rerun of capitalism in its early stages pollution huge amount of people thrown from the country to the city both the global north and the global south face a bleak future in this equation the decline of capitalism in the west is a product of capitalism wolff added it means the future of the u s is laid out in the economic deserts of detroit youngstown and pittsburgh there is no precedent on how people handle the reality of a long downward fall if the protests in the global north are often driven by a betrayal of a promised better future and the protests in the global south are often driven by raw exploitation we may have entered a decisive phase where neoliberalism can be attacked from multiple angles in his book the true believer thoughts on the nature of mass movements eric hoffer writes it is usually those whose poverty is relatively recent the new poor who throb with the ferment of frustration the memory of better things is a fire in their veins it may be an apt description of the millennials who entered a bankrupt west and were forced into a precariat existence they were the vanguard of occupy wall street in the u s the indignados in spain the yellow vests in france and the protests in puerto rico in contrast the protests in the global south where capitalism has ripped up raw resources used cheap labor and divided society into a few rich and many poor the demand is driven by a rebellion to protect what is most human in albert camus s book the rebel he wrote rebellion the sudden dazzling perception that there is something in man with which he can identify the part of himself that he wanted respected he proceeds to place above everything else even life itself if one adjusts the gendered language the point remains that the youth in the arab spring and now in lebanon haiti chile ecuador and iraq are not primarily fighting for a far off promised future but to live decently right now a new generation in the global north and the global south is rising up against neoliberalism we may be at a precious and rare turning point in history marx wrote in the communist manifesto what the bourgeoisie therefore produces above all is its own gravediggers if so the fires raging in the city streets are where the ideas of neoliberalism are burning in a funeral pyre copyright truthout reprinted with permission

socialistic sentiment can be traced back to the slave revolt of spartacus and peasant uprisings in europe for instance that led by thomas muntzer in germany but modern socialism began with those labelled as utopians by karl marx figures like robert owen who personally wanted to convince the bourgeoisie and nobility of an egalitarian communal society based around the means of production specifically communes of up to 3 000 people and all those others who depended on a socialist vision to convince people of the desirability of a socialist order as opposed to marxists who based their approach on the fact of class struggle generally socialists preferred equality an end to exploitation extension of democracy to the economy marxists wanted to socialise the means of production to end both exploitation and the destructiveness and wastefulness of capitalism and its boom bust cycle but marx had another criticism of capitalism and that was the way in which the division of labour and demanding nature of much work traumatised workers this was his theory of alienation today in australia for instance we are a world away from the working conditions of the 19th century but in call centres offices and factories the division of labour can still exclude creative control and work fulfilment indeed work conditions can still be traumatising in germany where the class struggle was advanced the social democrats arose as a combination of the marxists eisenachers and the lassalleans lassalleans led originally by ferdinand lasssalle believed in industry wide co operatives with state aid eventually marxism became dominant but by 1914 in germany right wing socialists had come to predominate in unions and the parliament and those people eschewed internationalism and supported the first world war before world war one both the european and british socialists supported the class struggle and the fight for universal suffrage to advance workers rights but britain was relatively liberal and this resulted in less emphasis on revolution and more emphasis on incrementalism fabianism arose in the 1880s and came to represent a movement to influence opinion in liberal and progressive circles especially in the labour party in britain beatrice and sidney webb prominent british fabians expressed sympathy with the achievements of soviet communism but that view did not last some fabians would focus on practical public policy others on the more radical aim of incrementally replacing capitalism again generally fabians were gradualist rather than supporting a sudden rupture modern australian fabianism shared the british fabian principles and was formed organisationally in 1947 the height of fabian influence was in the whitlam labor government after world war one the broad left was generally divided into communist social democratic and labourist camps although pockets of social democracy remained highly radical as in austria in the 1917 to 1934 period austro marxism these sought a middle path between bolshevism and mainstream international social democracy and there were anarchists and anarcho syndicalists who were significant in the spanish republican forces and the fight against the nazi backed fascist insurgency of franco in the spanish civil war from the 1940s through to the 1980s swedish social democracy enjoyed remarkable success replicated to various degrees in other nordic countries with full employment active industry policy strong unions and a strong welfare state for the overwhelming majority of this period social democrats held government basically workers received social security in return for a corporatist settlement including wage restraint the full employment achieved under the rehn meidner model also made a stronger welfare state possible though walter korpi conceived of the swedish situation differently as a democratic class struggle involving mobilisation of power resources and compromise depending on the balance of class power but in the 70s and 80s sweden also had to respond to the oil shocks and devalue the krona the meidner wage earner funds plan sought to compensate workers for wage restraint by giving them collective capital share but this implied a radical redistribution of wealth over time also because it appealed only to workers and not to citizens it could be argued that the funds could have included a wider base which is democratically preferable anyway capitalists went on the offensive socialists on the defensive and there has been a slow retreat since up until and including the 1970s and 1980s there remained strong pockets of radicalism in many labourist and social democratic parties but the oil shocks of the 70s and the drive to restore profits divided the left and led to socialist retreat also the soviet collapse during 1989 1991 had an enormously demoralising effect on the western left despite the fact the western left had long distanced itself from stalinism it s not unreasonable to see the gorbachev reform movement as a window of opportunity and a missed opportunity from hawke and keating onwards australian labor has broadly internalised neo liberal ideology small government privatisation free trade limits on the liberties of organised labour trade agreements which give capital an effective veto on regulation and public sector expansion marxism used to have a strong base in the socialist left but increasingly the factions have lost ideological cohesion and have been subsumed in the mainstream political discourse indeed the experience of hawke and keating inspired tony blair and antony giddens with their third way or radical social democratic centre in the 19th and early 20th centuries centrism had been a largely catholic phenomenon including limited support for trade unions labour market regulation and welfare since giddens and blair the third way has come to represent neo liberalism with a human face punitive welfare on the one hand but also the principle there should be an economic and social floor below which no one should be allowed to fall blair also marginally increased tax will australian labor still consider tax reform for the next election but he would not retreat an inch in opposing any re socialisation no matter how badly privatisation had failed eg of railways in australia more recently centrism as epitomised by the centre alliance struggles to maintain a credible liberalism let alone any kind of social democracy for instance there is conditional support for the ensuring integrity union busting legislation today centrism in australia can mean a shallow populism cashing in on broad disillusionment with the two party system significant parts of the alp right consider themselves centrist after the blairite model blairites also generally accept capitalism as a given fast forward to 2019 and what is to be done capitalism remains more vulnerable than people think there is much focus on public debt but private debt is a ticking time bomb that could lead to loss of confidence panic and collapse in australia the us and much of the world private debt is many times the level of public debt the australian economy especially has come to rest on the housing bubble millions are locked out of home ownership but sudden and radical devaluation would cause panic and collapse the boom bust cycle remains a fact but governments focused on public debt are less likely to engage in counter cyclical measures this could one day mean recession or depression as the solution to indebtedness modern monetary theory mmt has it that government can create money at will but this is not without limits it involves a degree of redistribution which capitalists hate but also inflation progressive tax is still more effective at redistributing wealth in a targeted and progressive way but certainly the mmt crowd are on to something the labor party today is probably inclined to want to save capitalism from itself the welfare state and higher minimum wages can assist by boosting expenditure and demand a return to a meaningfully mixed economy can help by reducing cost structures via natural public monopolies this could flow on to the private sector as well as well this could counter oligopolistic collusion for instance in banking actually promoting competition higher government expenditure can also add money to the economy increase demand and ameliorate the explosion of private debt which is a ticking time bomb for the economy here and globally an expanded social wage welfare state collective consumption and social insurance can also provide social justice and social security think reformed pensions easing means testing and increasing payments public housing better funded schools and hospitals more money for the pharmaceutical benefits scheme more efficient public provision of infrastructure because of a better rate of borrowing and a public interest test rather than share value and dividend maximisation also consider national aged care insurance and a withdrawal of regressive user pays mechanisms as well as a retreat of user pays in education these are ameliorative reforms that can improve peoples lives but australia is still captive to the global economy and will suffer along the rest of the world in any general downturn or collapse over the long term we still need to think about an alternative to capitalism sub prime and the global financial crisis did not only reveal instability it also revealed the gap between use value and exchange value as marx would put it that is there was an abundance of housing amidst widespread destitution and homelessness this is a real capitalist failing and vulnerability marx s weakness was that he did not propose any concrete alternative vision to capitalism he assumed the class struggle would take care of things so maybe in part the utopian socialists were on to something the context of class struggle had to be engaged with but also concrete visions for the future today perhaps we need provisional utopias we cannot afford to be a force of pure negation with no vision for the future especially after the real historical experience of stalinism but capitalism is a globally reinforcing system you can t just go it alone in revolutionising the entire economy there are economic and political constraints but what can be done is to begin a process of revolutionary reforms say in the spirit of the interwar austrian social democrats even today in austria there is a legacy in vienna of 60 public housing and overwhelmingly high quality public housing a democratic mixed economy would stabilise capitalism through strategic socialisation and redistribution while at the same time advancing towards an alternative as in austria this would also involve a counter culture a rebuilding and reassertion of the labour movement but also a coalition with other social movements what gramsci would have called a counter hegemonic historic bloc that also involves establishing online presences other publications public meetings progressive radio and television social events of various kinds plays workers sport radical music etc establishing footholds where ever possible importantly the decline of industrial labour with deindustrialisation has widely meant a decline in class consciousness service sector workers can be just as exploited but are more likely to think themselves middle class or lack class consciousness we can and should fight this but the industrial working class might not any longer be seen in the marxist sense as a finally redemptive universal historic subject the labour movement is central but the modern left also needs alliances and should another global financial crisis occur the big finance houses should not be bailed out at the public s expense where the public sector steps in if that occurs it should retain a share in ownership of course when it comes to advanced socialist transition bourgeois economic and political resistance has to be expected the democratic mixed economy should be the short to medium term model that includes a key place for natural public monopolies strategic government business enterprises consumers and workers co operatives of various sorts including multi stakeholder co ops which bring workers governments and regions together mutualist associations as well as collective capital formation the meidner funds were such in australia superannuation was a very pale imitation which may actually endanger welfare into the future by narrowing its base multi stakeholder co ops are an important idea as they could enable expansions of economies of scale to retain competitiveness under capitalism all these are part of a concrete alternative there is also a need to restore and consolidate industrial liberties to increase organised labour s power its ability to deliver and hence its coverage strength and ability to contribute to change furthermore how do we tackle alienation today in marx s sense even with deindustrialisation workers still find themselves alienated in modern professions for instance call centre workers the post industrial utopia has so far failed to emerge at the least we can improve wages and conditions for the most exploited and alienated workers with low end labour market regulation and maybe government subsidies where the market will not bear higher wages perhaps enabling a reduction of the working week for many though others would crave longer hours free time is perhaps one alternative for now to marx s vision of a communism where workers regained creative control and labour becomes life s prime want a quote from marx but alienation is a feature of broader modernity and not only capitalism the rise of co operatives could at least facilitate worker control also ameliorating alienation in the final instance we need to think of where improvements in productivity could lead either to greater equality plenty and free time for everyone or in the capitalist context only the intensification of growth profit and exploitation and possibly greater inequality if we do not socialise much of the gains of productivity what marx called the coercive laws of competition means that competition forces a focus on productivity for capitalist profit and short term economic advantage the problem is finding a way out of this circuit as well as the intensification of exploitation and a lagging behind in wages in labour intensive areas where productivity improvements are hard to come by we need to think where free trade and internationalism fit in to this problem there are environmental implications as well capitalism by its very nature will trend towards the endless growth option perhaps if the emphasis is on information and service industries it could be more environmentally sustainable but sweden is also a warning again there has been retreat since the meidner wage earner funds the corporatist consensus delivered for several decades in sweden but since the bourgeoisie got cold feet and organised more overtly against swedish social democracy there has been a retreat swedish social democracy now has to work with swedish liberalism to keep the right wing parties out and the price has been a retreat of the swedish welfare state and progressive tax in short socialists and social democrats have to be ready for capitalist backlash class struggle creates change that remains true but so too do broader coalitions cultural and electoral strategies the fabian society in australia is placed to mount cultural interventions and hence influence the electoral strategies of the labor party and the broader left we won t get all that we want all at once but we need a critique of capitalism we have to be prepared for future crises we have to think what a transition would look like under what circumstances and what time frame but all the time considering the reality of power economic and political including the power of the state and all in a global context where global progress remains limited without global consciousness and organisation which is something the fabians also need to be thinking about building ties with democratic socialists of america for instance could be a fruitful endeavour the fabian society re embracing its place as an organisation of democratic socialism means engaging with these problems for the short to medium term it is to be hoped we have an important strategic place in developing a democratic mixed economy

always something new always something i didn t expect and sometimes it isn t horrible robert jordan anyone still believe the stock market is capped it can t go higher and the risk is to the downside let s just tell it like it is it was another of the wrong footed ideas that was floated around all year november is in the books and it is the third straight month of gains for the s p in fact five out of the last six months have produced gains now totaling 14 since the end of may this has all occurred when the dominant commentary was global recession and weeks of negative spin on the trade headlines in the 21 trading days since the s p 500 first closed at a record high less than a month ago the s p 500 has seen 11 record closing highs each one more painful than the next for anyone that decided to ignore the price action the pain trade hasn t been the downside forecasts that were highlighted all year coming out of the thanksgiving holiday and into december has historically been a good time of year for the bulls however the bears will remind us of what occurred last year december 2018 was a nightmare and they are clinging to that notion like a drowning person clings to a lifeboat unfortunately the lifeboat they believe is their salvation may have a few holes in it this time last year is significantly different than what we see this year back then the s p had already suffered a large decline with momentum clearly pointing to the downside this time around the s p enters the last month of the year on a strong up swing so despite the fact that we will be reminded that valuations are extended and the leading sectors have begun to show some weakness many still don t understand rotation seasonal trends like the chase for performance and the equity market s recent ability to shake off weakness may shred these arguments in the short term if the latter proves to be incorrect it won t matter much for the bulls they have plenty to show for their patience the six week winning streak for the s p along with the seven week winning streak for the nasdaq composite both ended on november 22nd the hedgers started to smile as they believed this might be the time to take another guess at profiting from a drop in the indices it turns out that guessing isn t a good way to manage money they aren t alone when it comes to taking a shot in the dark the pundits that believed they had it correct by calling for more lows in october when the equity markets were showing weakness are also flustered maybe we need to stop the political correctness and call it the way it is they are flat out embarrassed and are looking for places to hide more frustration for the naysayers set in early this week as the s p posted another new high on monday the real standout though was the russell 2000 index which gained 2 07 its best one day performance in over two months and it made a new 52 week high it is broad based strength that at some point will become evident to the skeptics that continue to argue their points as they get run over again information tech 1 43 healthcare 1 07 and consumer disc 0 89 were the best performing sectors both financials and healthcare made new 52 week highs and information tech made a new closing high the risk on mindset was evident as utilities were off 37 on the day on monday 40 stocks in the s p 500 made a new 52 week high and there was one new 52 week low it didn t end there the pain trade continued it was more bad news for the bad news bears as the three major indices posted more new highs the s p recorded its 25th new high for 2019 on wednesday ahh but the doubters remain there was commentary suggesting this price action should be taken with a grain of salt due to the shortened holiday week and we were all reminded that the december 15th tariffs are looming for the year the s p is up 25 the dow industrials 21 and the nasdaq composite 31 i m sure the naysayers will remind me that the s p is only up 2 7 from the peak in january 2018 there is a problem with that i didn t start investing in this bull market at the peak in january 2018 and neither did a host of other bullish investors the bulls might want to remind everyone the s p is up 40 from january 2017 the stock market often comes down to perception the ability to see hear or become aware of something through the senses a way of regarding understanding or interpreting something a mental impression while that word impacts our everyday lives it may play a bigger part in our investing life how we perceive all of the situations that the financial world throws at us can become a complex mind boggling exercise with the major indices at all time closing highs some have the perception that it is just another step to new highs while others perceive it as a sign for a correction perhaps a major top then of course there are those with the view this entire stock market is one big fed induced bubble that is about to burst resulting in a market crash that last notion gets tiring we have come to the point in time where we simply need to dismiss that argument in its entirety it s been incorrect for multiple years and that debate is now officially declared over that last comment will draw the ire of some but that is what it was meant to do for those that may be upset please wake up and realize what has been going on around you the equity market is writing a story for those that have paid attention each chapter has brought challenges but has told investors during the journey what is important and what isn t a journey that many mistakenly have found fault with every step of the way back in 2014 i listed what were cited as reasons to fear the stock market corporate profits growth isn t sustainable profit margins will fall the stock market is extremely overvalued buybacks are the only factor supporting the stock market small businesses can t grow there s too much regulation corporations are too uncertain to hire and invest the us has too much debt the us budget deficit is too large the strong dollar will hurt earnings the fed s policies will cause inflation there s too much uncertainty to take risk investors are taking too much risk housing is in another bubble bond spreads are too wide credit downgrades will be numerous hedging downside risk is critical ironically other than the regulatory environment improving somewhat we hear the same concerns today when i originally penned that list the s p was 1 800 the index closed at 3 150 on friday skeptics may now want to revisit their arguments revisit

ticks to 126 1 in october the index was at 136 4 a year ago and compares to a 16 month low of 121 7 in january and an 18 year high of 137 9 in october of 2018 notably all of the weakness was in the

economist while contract signings have decreased the overall economic landscape remains favorable mortgage rates continue to be low at below 4 which will attract buyers employment levels are strong and many recession claims have dissipated we still need to address and more importantly correct inadequate levels of inventory across the country there is no shortage of buyers seeking homes but a lack of available units continues to drag down the nation s housing market and overall economy we risk a lingering shortage of sufficient inventory if home building only continues at its current pace over the next 20 years when the u s population is projected to increase by more than 40 million over this period clearly home builders must step in and construct more housing global economy euro zone economic sentiment rises to 101 3 in november from 100 8 in october boosted by improved confidence among manufacturers consumers and service providers france consumer confidence continues to defy the

energy to the impeachment inquiry the media in particular loves this story it provides endless possibilities for reports headlines commentaries and interviews all leading up to the iowa caucuses that will take place in about 11 weeks on february 3rd the new hampshire primary will follow about a week later the recent impeachment inquiry hearings will run their course during the time ahead it appears the house will vote on impeachment and there is a strong possibility that a majority along strict party lines will vote in favor of impeachment the matter would then be sent to the senate where both parties will get their chance to call witnesses and the president will be allowed to mount a defense the nation has been living through plenty of political turmoil during the past three years that has hampered progress on many issues that are positives for the voting public it is no wonder that the vast majority of people have become numb to the news flow i daresay that the majority of americans are far more concerned with their job prospects and their household finances than they are about what various politicians in washington have to say about past conversations between u s officials and members of their family and the ukrainian government perhaps small business owners and the american public will be given an end of year surprise in what is considered a positive development by both parties house speaker pelosi usmca deal is within range while the chief executive of hong kong is not a democratically elected position there are elections in hong kong last sunday voters took to the polls to elect district councilors for the 18 local districts around the territory in aggregate there are 452 seats prior to the vote 242 of those were controlled by pro beijing parties but now only 61 seats are controlled by pro beijing representatives turnout was more than 70 as voters revolted against the police crackdown that beijing has pushed since protests began back in the spring it s important to note that while the number of seats swung aggressively against pro beijing parties the popular vote swing of 15 percentage points was much less dramatic the takeaway democracy protests are succeeding in mobilizing the populace to their cause without creating a substantial backlash so far given the pro democracy outcome one has to wonder why our congress got involved in the first place that action taken by congress was mentioned last week as a potential stumbling block in the ongoing trade negotiations a wedge that might get the two parties off track while china is clearly not happy with what has taken place so far that does not seem to be the case the fed in the latest beige book prepared at the federal reserve bank of dallas based on information collected on or before november 18 the central bank presented the following economic activity expanded modestly from october through mid november similar to the pace of growth seen over the prior reporting period most districts reported stable to moderately growing consumer spending and increases in auto sales and tourism were seen across several districts in manufacturing more districts reported an expansion in the current period than the previous one though the majority continued to experience no growth the picture for non financial services remained quite positive with most districts reporting modest to moderate growth transportation activity was rather mixed across districts reports from the banking sector indicated continued but slightly slower growth in loan volumes home sales were mostly flat to up and residential construction experienced more widespread growth compared to the prior report construction and leasing activity of nonresidential real estate continued to increase at a modest pace agricultural conditions were little changed overall remaining strained by weather and low crop prices activity in the energy sector deteriorated modestly among reporting districts outlooks generally remained positive with some contacts expecting the current pace of growth to continue into next year the 10 year treasury rates have come down to the 1 77 level and have remained flat for over a week now perhaps a base that is being built for a run higher or a pause before the bottom 1 47 is tested again the 3 month 10 year treasury curve inverted on may 23rd and other than a brief one day change that curve remained inverted until october 10th the 2 10 treasury yield curve inverted on august 27th that inversion lasted for three days for some that means the countdown clock has started for a recession and the cycle peak in the s p 500 that crowd may be disappointed i maintained from the first day 2 10 treasuries inverted only a sustained inversion is a meaningful recession signal history then tells us on average a recession occurs 18 months after a sustained 2 10 yield curve inversion none of these yield curves are inverted today source u s dept of the treasury the 2 10 spread started the year at 16 basis points it stands at 14 basis points today sentiment aaii sentiment survey results did not show any major shifts as bullish sentiment remains

all of that decline coming on friday the technical picture when it comes to market internals overall market breadth continues to be positive as has been the case for well over a year now the s p 500 s cumulative a d line has continued to lead and confirm moves higher in the index s price while the s p 500 hit a new all time closing high on november 18th the a d line reached a new high the very next day the relentless grind higher continues with more new highs being forged this week for the s p and other major indices chart courtesy of freestockcharts com on the one hand we see an overbought market that looks vulnerable but on the other a market that has strong seasonal patterns in place trying to forecast when the advance comes to an end has been the incorrect move no need to guess what may occur instead it will be important to concentrate on the short term pivots that are meaningful however the long term view the view from 30 000 feet is the only way to make successful decisions these details are available in my daily updates to subscribers short term views are presented to give market participants a feel for the current situation it should be noted that strategic investment decisions should not be based on any short term view these views contain a lot of noise and will lead an investor into whipsaw action that tends to detract from overall performance many pundits kept harping on the notion that small caps were underperforming highlighting that as some sort of warning signal about the overall equity market patience and common sense has paid off as the small caps as measured by the russell 2000 just made a new 52 week high chart courtesy of freestockcharts com the bulls still have some work to do as the index remains 5 5 from its all time high however it is obvious now this was never any warning sign individual stocks and sectors at times it hasn t felt this way but in 2019 the markets have shown broad based strength technology remains on top and despite the recent run in healthcare that sector remains in a position where more gains may lie ahead every day we are presented with choices stay with a long held belief that may not be working well or make a change in our minds reversing our opinions is not a comfortable feeling especially if we stood up and announced a strong opinion to the world and now it looks wrong in reality one doesn t have to announce the strategy to anyone all that is needed is to play that opinion over and over in our own minds people simply talk themselves into trouble it s then very difficult to suddenly back off that declaration once a stand is taken there is a natural tendency to behave in ways that are stubbornly consistent with that position in my opinion this is a big issue that holds investors back and it is one of the reasons so many have not participated in this bull market to the extent they should have if investors are going to be successful there will be times when they will have to eat some humble pie look at the situation around them and reassess their strategy the skeptics have refused to reassess or give in and they have paid the price people still want to debate the fed and their influence on stock prices in my view that debate is over there is simply no reason for more discussion there is nothing to be proven by hanging on to that premise the equity market is higher the gains are real the difference in believing in what the stock market was telling us and then investing or being obsessed with the fed and not participating is night and day so with more new highs being forged we can all expect to be told a correction is coming as i have said in past missives the bulls are well aware of that it is the bears that need tutoring the stock market warned them all year long and those warnings were dismissed instead they recited the same nonsense that was recited in 2014 just as guilty are the we can t take a stand pundits they couldn t decide if the s p was going to 2 200 or 3 000 they left anyone that listened swinging in the wind with no clear direction one thing we can all be sure of they will all be back to criticize and question anyone that has been bullish they always seem to have all of the answers they just aren t sure which one will be correct let s continue to be honest politically incorrect and call that for what it is worthless analysis this past week was special a holiday week with much to be thankful for topped off by new stock market highs the many who argued vehemently that staying in the market was foolish are now the pundits that have a lot of questions to answer and an oven full of humble pie to eat i do thank them for their contribution this year it was the conviction they displayed in their outright misunderstanding of the stock market and faulty analysis that reinforced my decisions to avoid the noise and follow the trend i would also like to take a moment and remind all of the readers of an important issue in these types of forums readers bring a host of situations and variables to the table when visiting these articles therefore it is impossible to pinpoint what may be right for each situation please keep that in mind when

turmoil a decade of historically low interest rates has allowed companies to sell record amounts of bonds to investors sending total u s corporate debt to nearly 10 trillion or a record 47 of the overall economy in recent weeks the federal reserve the international monetary fund and major institutional investors such as blackrock and american funds all have sounded the alarm about the mounting corporate obligations the danger isn t immediate but some regulators and investors say the borrowing has gone on too long and could send financial markets plunging when the next recession hits dealing the real economy a blow at a time when it already would be wobbling some of america s best known companies including at t ford motor and cvs health have splurged on borrowed cash this year the weakest firms have accounted for most of the growth and are increasingly using debt for financial risk taking such as investor payouts and wall street dealmaking rather than new plants and equipment according to the imf amid the avalanche of debt the sharp growth in lower quality corporate bonds just one notch above junk represents a special concern investors hold nearly 4 trillion in these bonds including 2 5 trillion from u s companies according to the credit rating agency standard poor s since oct 1 familiar names like hasbro nordstrom marriott and hyundai all have tapped investors for cash by

little more than a decade after consumers binged on inexpensive mortgages that helped bring on a global financial crisis a new debt surge this time by major corporations threatens to unleash fresh turmoil a decade of historically low interest rates has allowed companies to sell record amounts of bonds to investors sending total u s corporate debt to nearly 10 trillion or a record 47 percent of the overall economy in recent weeks the federal reserve the international monetary fund and major institutional investors such as blackrock and american funds all have sounded the alarm about the mounting corporate obligations the danger isn t immediate but some regulators and investors say the borrowing has gone on too long and could send financial markets plunging when the next recession hits dealing the real economy a blow at a time when it already would be wobbling some of america s best known companies including at t ford motor and cvs health have splurged on borrowed cash this

by frank holmes ceo and chief investment officer u s investors flying in the face of negative economic news u s factories picked up steam for the third straight month in november the preliminary manufacturing purchasing manager s index pmi a leading indicator we closely track here at u s global investors pulled further away from its august low with a reading of 52 2 this month that s up from 51 3 in october and marks a seven month high remember investors are better served when they follow the trend lines not the headlines a raft of economic reports on friday welcomed the turnaround chris williamson chief economist at ihs markit which releases the monthly pmi wrote that the november reading adds to evidence that the worst of the economy s recent soft patch may be behind us responding to the manufacturing uptrend renaissance macro s head of economics neil dutta urged investors to look for construction activity to rise today s improvement wrote cornerstone macro s nancy lazar shows u s manufacturing is recovering as trade uncertainty recedes finally stan shipley at evercore isi said that friday s improved pmi and consumer sentiment releases suggest solid employment and consumer spending will pull the manufacturing sector higher rather than the manufacturing sector dragging the overall economy lower taken together this is all very constructive not just for manufacturers but also exporters container shipping companies and cargo airlines not to mention the energy materials and financial sectors the boeing co for instance announced a bump in orders for its still grounded 737 max aircraft following this year s dubai airshow the world s largest aerospace event boeing reported that kazakhstan s air astana had committed itself to as many as 30 max jets while an undisclosed buyer ordered 20 this comes after sunexpress a turkish leisure carrier purchased 10 bringing the total value of max sales to 7 5 billion negative headlines may get the clicks but savvy investors who can look past those headlines and follow the money often get the rewards global debt expected to hit a new record amount although the pmi report is encouraging there s still reason to remain somewhat cautious long term the latest accounting of global debt levels was just released and the news might be so bad that it s good for gold prices at least after climbing above 250 trillion in the first half of 2019 the amount of debt that s owed by governments the financial sector and non financial sector is now forecast to touch a record 255 trillion by year s end according to the washington d c based institute of international finance iif says iif economists this mind boggling sum is the equivalent of 320 percent of total global economic activity the highest level ever to put it another way for every 1 that s produced today an additional 3 20 in debt is created and thrown atop the heap i shouldn t need to say it but i will anyway this is unsustainable as economist martin murenbeeld writes in his most recent gold monitor newsletter rising global debt levels is one of our most important medium long term factors in the gold outlook that s because debt inhibits growth murenbeeld says and high debt levels will when central banks are committed to targeting maximum employment and stable inflation limit central banks policy options to loose or very loose all this will be very positive for gold of course he adds 7 trillion in unfunded u s pension liabilities here in the u s national debt hit an unimaginable 23 trillion on october 31 halloween day of all days that s roughly 107 percent of u s gross domestic product gdp or nearly double its share of the economy from 2000 this data comes from u s national debt clock which i highly recommend you visit if you haven t already done so it s an invaluable tool what i find particularly eye opening is the amount of unfunded public pension liabilities they re currently closing in on 7 trillion the equivalent of 20 700 per u s citizen an unfunded pension is any retirement plan for which sufficient assets have not been set aside and as murenbeeld points out such obligations can inhibit economic growth the greater they become the more tax revenues must go not toward infrastructure education and other public benefits but to fixed costs it should come as no surprise to you that the u s city facing the biggest shortfall at the moment is chicago illinois about a third of the windy city s budget is earmarked for pension payments alone and when you combine other obligations such as debt service and other postemployment benefits opebs fixed costs amount to 45 percent of expenditures back in july 2017 i discussed the illinois budget crisis at length and since then not much has improved despite state and city leaders best efforts in fiscal year 2019 illinois taxpayers contributed a record 10 billion toward the state s unfunded pension liabilities and yet it still wasn t enough to prevent them from growing from 131 billion in 2018 to 137 billion this year unfunded chicago pensions have also deepened further into deficit in the four years since former mayor rahm emanuel s series of painful tax hikes on everything from property to water services to 911 emergency lines according to a chicago tribune investigation city pension debt has ballooned to 7 billion since the new taxes went into effect in 2015 time to replace bonds wgc says maybe my reason for sharing this with you is that again higher debt levels have put tremendous pressure on the federal reserve and central banks in general to keep monetary policy loose or very loose in turn bond yields have been unremarkable lately to say the least case in point the nominal 10 year treasury yield was trading at just under 1 8 percent on friday which coincidentally is the current annual rate of u s inflation according to the department of labor s october report what this means is that the real yield on the 10 year t note is a big fat 0 percent and when this happens according to the world gold council wgc it may be time to replace bonds with gold re optimizing portfolio structures for lower future expected bond returns suggests investors should consider an additional 1 percent to 1 5 percent gold exposure in diversified portfolios the wgc writes in a report dated october 30 the london based group adds that extremely low or negative yielding bonds could weigh on the overall performance of investors portfolios which favors additional gold exposure gold is on sale creating room for further gains last week gold continued to trade below its 50 day and 100 day moving averages as investors seem to be waiting for the next catalyst whether that s fed policy movements in the u s dollar or developments in the u s china trade war in a note to investors ubs strategist joni teves says she sees the pause in gold prices as an opportunity for investors we think the ongoing consolidation in the market is healthy creating room for further gains and likely also easing some of the persistent concerns on positioning joni writes we would view this as an opportunity to gradually re engage at better levels especially as investors look to the year ahead with uncertainty likely to persist and rates likely to stay low she concludes by saying that gold could trade at 1 600 an ounce next year with a pit stop at 1 550 over the next three months thinking about buying the dip in gold watch my interview with kitco s daniela cambone by clicking here all opinions expressed and data provided are subject to

the relationship between saudi arabia and iran both oil rich states in the middle east has oscillated from co operation to conflict throughout history alongside a range of factors that shape their rivalry including sectarianism and nationalism has been the politics of oil oil is a strategic international commodity and its use as a political tool is widespread its role in the saudi iranian rivalry can t be understood without unpicking the international context and the power structures that govern the way countries interact with each other at the heart of this is the dominance of the us over this international system the dynamics between the us iran and saudi arabia over oil were laid bare in september 2019 after a series of drone attacks on saudi oil facilities the attacks caused the suspension of 5 7m barrels per day mbpd of crude oil production nearly half the saudi output the houthis a yemeni faction claimed responsibility however american and saudi government officials accused iran of committing these attacks in return the iranians blamed foreign forces in the region for the insecurity and told the us to leave the area while the saudi iranian oil rivalry is ostensibly the business of these two countries it has always had an international dimension overshadowed by the us read more saudi and iran how our two countries could make peace and bring stability to the middle east after the revolution the 1979 iranian revolution marked a turning point for the place oil played within the saudi iranian relationship before then both countries were important allies of the us a position which brought with it political and economic benefits particularly to their oil industries but the 1979 islamic revolution in iran paved the way for a separation of paths while saudi arabia remained a staunch ally of the us iran adopted a revolutionary and anti western foreign policy which prompted its isolation from an international system that was dominated by the us as a result ever since 1979 the iranian oil industry has been subject to american pressure through a range of economic sanctions and embargoes which has crippled iranian oil production iran has been unable to reach the level of oil production of over six mbpd that it had in the pre revolution years meanwhile saudi oil production reached over 12 mbpd in 2018 this led to the iranian oil industry being deprived of necessary foreign investment and technology transfer and it has fallen behind saudi aramco the kingdom s state owned oil company and other regional competitors saudi arabia has largely backed the us policy of isolating and sanctioning iran particularly the iranian oil industry which has as i ve argued elsewhere contributed to the ongoing tensions in the saudi iranian relationship as saudi aramaco prepares for an ipo in december that could make it the world s biggest publicly listed company iran is desperate to revitalise its own outmoded oil industry as iranian oil minister bijan zanganeh admitted in early 2019 many of iran s ageing oil facilities are in fact operating museums read more saudi aramco s 1 5 trillion ipo flies in the face of climate reality the us continues to have such an influence on middle eastern oil politics because of the way it has successfully pushed its own international agenda since 1945 after world war ii the us cemented its dominance over an international system built on the basis of liberal and capitalist principles while the us rewards its allies with economic and political benefits it punishes its challengers through a range of political and economic measures not least economic sanctions oil became a strategic international commodity in the post world war ii period and began to play a pivotal role in the way the us maintained its global dominance to do this the us aimed to open up and transnationalise oil rich economies in the global south such as saudi arabia and iran to both promote its national interests and solidify its privileged position within the current system accordingly the supply of middle eastern oil into international markets without disruption and at a reasonable price became an essential instrument for maintaining american dominance even though the us didn t need to import oil from the middle east a world of us dominance the political economist susan strange provided a theoretical framework back in 1987 to explain the structure of us dominance over the international system through four main dimensions production finance security and knowledge this is also a useful way to understand how the us shapes the international oil market and the saudi iranian rivalry by 2018 in the wake of a shale boom the us became the largest oil producing country in the world by reaching production of 15 mbpd financially oil has been priced and traded in us dollars in particular since the early 1970s when a series of negotiations and agreements linking the sale of oil to the us dollar were made between saudi arabia and the us this has increased global demand for us dollars and helped the us deal with its trade deficit and keep its interest rates low it has also helped the us to monitor the petroleum trade by controlling global bank transfers the us also stands as a main security provider to oil rich gulf monarchies with publicly acknowledged military bases in over 12 countries in the middle east additionally it has a supremacy over global knowledge most obviously through its continued domination and control of the sector s technological needs by leading global innovation and technological development in the shale revolution for example and having the highest budget for research and development the us largely controls global technology transfer this has also deprived iran of necessary technology capital and know how to modernise its ageing oil industry constraining production therefore despite the fact that the saudi iranian oil rivalry seems like a regional issue the role of american power in a globalised world has been key to shaping this regional political competition over oil sukru cildir phd candidate lancaster university this article is

ukraine won appeal in gas transit dispute with gazprom the cabinet began to pay off insurance arrears while the hryvnia renewed its four year high twice a week these are the main economic developments of the outgoing week the last week of november was marked by another energy victory over russia ukraine has won an appeal against gazprom on the russian monopoly s first claim to the stockholm arbitration award which in may 2017 ruled in favor of the ukrainian side to have gazprom pay compensation for insufficient gas transit volumes complete victory ukraine is winning again we have won the appeal on the first complaint of gazprom against the decision of the stockholm arbitration executive director of njsc naftogaz of ukraine yuriy vitrenko wrote on facebook the court ruling confirms the cancellation by the stockholm arbitration of gazprom s take or pay claim which frees ukraine from the obligation to pay 80 billion to the russian monopoly the tribunal also ruled that naftogaz has the right to market adjustment of the price formula in addition the ban on gas re export which was part of the contract has been lifted видео дня also according to vitrenko gazprom must compensate naftogaz all court fees which amount to eur 1 million and uah 1 65 million the award cannot be challenged in essence but despite this fact it is too early for ukraine to relax because so far the court has rejected only one appeal of the russians to only one decision made in stockholm and in february and autumn of 2020 hearings will be held on two other complaints of gazprom oral hearings in the case of gazprom s application for appeal of the second arbitral award final in the gas sale and purchase case should be considered in february 2020 hearings on the appeal of the third decision under the transit contract are scheduled for next fall said naftogaz ceo andriy kobolyev he noted that the arbitration awards remain valid and are enforceable despite the appeal process it is worth noting that the ukrainian side did not just sit and wait for the end of litigation but feeling the sweet taste of victory went on the offensive on friday came the report that naftogaz filed a suit with the court in latvia to recognize and enforce the stockholm arbitration award in the gas transit dispute of february 28 2018 as well as to take interim measures such actions are connected with the recovery of 2 6 billion from gazprom a court hearing in this case is scheduled for late april 2020 debt collapse in the past week the government finally embarked on a solution to the problems with insurance payment debts the cabinet of ministers allocated an additional uah 1 4 billion to pay off sick leave pregnancy and childbirth leave as well as burial payments over 2019 the awkward situation regarding insurance payments has been lasting from last week then the social insurance fund announced the suspension of payments to insured persons citing budget exhaustion a few days later the situation grew more tense one of the first ones to raise the alarm was liudmyla denisova the ukrainian parliament commissioner for human rights she stated that the arrears on sick leaves for employees has reached uah 1 billion denisova called on the chairman of the board of the social insurance fund volodymyr saienko and minister of social policy yulia sokolovska to immediately amend the fund s budget the government heard the ombudsperson s words and besides providing additional funds the prime minister promised to change in the coming week the leadership of the social insurance fund in addition to the delay in insurance payments problems also affected salaries in particular some teachers and doctors have not been paid since september in the past week the issue has become extremely heated president volodymyr zelensky intervened asking the government to pay off arrears as soon as possible the cabinet of ministers responded with lightning speed the very next day more than uah 171 million was redistributed to teachers salaries and uah 326 million to doctors in addition the ministry of health assured that from next year there will be no wage arrears for ukrainian healthcare personnel this according to the ministry s plan should be facilitated by an amended mechanism for the payment of medical subventions now the amount of funds allocated will depend on the number of medical services provided in turn the ministry of education and science assured that it is working hard to prevent arrears next year the actual number of students at schools will be taken into account in the educational subvention for the first time simply put they used to pay wages by the number of students at schools which is much lower than realistic but in fact this means that teachers have under received money in recent years finally we re fixing this problem and add uah 2 2 billion in order to take into account the number of students that is realistic the ministry assured another important decision by the cabinet was an independent audit of the pension fund honcharuk noted that the audit will allow spending less money on the fund administration as early as next year and thus more money will go to ukrainians at the same time the prime minister did not indicate the deadlines for the audit we need to clearly understand what s happening with the pension fund there is reason to believe that a significant part of the funds is being used inefficiently honcharuk emphasized the government also approved a draft law on the translation of work books into digital format workers will not have to live through the soviet practice of collecting a bunch of paperwork to confirm their seniority the prime minister said at the same time pensions and social benefits will gradually be assigned automatically without unnecessary bureaucracy or visits to the pension fund new hryvnia records in the past week the ukrainian national currency broke another record twice updating its four year high on tuesday the national bank set the official rate at uah 24 05 per dollar the next day the hryvnia updated its record the official dollar rate dipped even more and reached the level of uah 23 98 per dollar the strengthening of the national currency experts say is due to the favorable macro financial situation in the country and the state of the balance of payments from the beginning of the month there was a predominance of currency supply on the interbank market against the background of the usual activity of exporters who don t risk staying in the dollar amid such a trend non residents who took part in the acquisition of long term government bonds including 4 year issued in november continued to provide key sales along with some state owned companies that successfully placed eurobonds senior analyst at raiffeisen bank aval mykhailo rebryk said in a comment to unian the demand for currency he says was fueled by active purchases by the national bank which bought about 817 million on the interbank market at the same time rebryk warns of a possible devaluation pressure in december we cannot rule out possible episodes of the hryvnia s temporary weakening provoked by news on imf developments destructive action by oligarchs pressure on the nbu street rallies over donbas and the growing volatility of global financial markets in general according to analysts at raiffeisen bank aval the hryvnia in december may slide to about uah 25 5 per dollar also in the past week the national bank announced the introduction of a number of new banknotes and coins viktor zaivenko chief of the nbu money management department says uah 5 coins will be put into circulation on december 20 to gradually replace corresponding banknotes in addition from this date updated uah 50 notes will emerge next year from february 25 the national bank will issue updated uah 200 notes and in the second quarter of 2020 we will see uah 10 coins the nbu notes that a periodic change in the design of banknotes is associated with minimizing the risks of fraud by fraudsters and replacing banknotes with coins will allow the state to save about a billion hryvnias since the life expectancy of coins is about 20 25 years while the corresponding banknotes can circulate on average one to two years also this week the ministry of finance noted the growing budget deficit over the 10 months it has increased fivefold to uah 30 billion the ministry of finance said bond sale brought uah2 4 billion to the state budget the state statistics service reported that foreign direct investment in ukraine economy for the first half of the year grew by 1 8 million up to 34 7 billion most of the increase 1 14 billion was due to the exchange rate difference amid hryvnia strengthening next week the country will continue to monitor government negotiations with the imf consultations are currently underway in washington and their results are expected to be announced in the near future meanwhile people s deputies will convene in the verkhovna rada to adopt more laws important for the state oleksandr kunytsky

australia s banking system and share market was thrown into turmoil this week by the forced resignation of brian hartzer the ceo of westpac the country s oldest bank and one of the big four that dominate the local lending market and stock exchange hartzer s fall comes on top of the liberal national coalition government s 2017 19 royal commission inquiry it confirmed in case after case that the banks and other major finance houses had long been guilty of defrauding customers of millions of dollars including by charging fees for no services and taking money off the dead despite this systemic criminality undertaken in order to boost profits to record levels no bank chief has been placed on trial instead the profiteering has resumed in new forms overall profits have been dented seriously however by record low interest rates a real estate property plunge and new tech based competitors there also has been some divestiture of the banks most lucrative and notorious operations such as those offering loss making financial advice and deceptive insurance policies this latest scandal does not directly involve cheating customers rather it centres on allegations leveled against westpac management by the australian transaction reports and analysis centre austrac the official money tracking agency whose far reaching surveillance and transaction tracking powers were extended in 2006 in the name of combatting terrorism nominally hartzer was compelled to quit by large superannuation funds and institutional shareholders after austrac unveiled about 23 million charges of breaching money laundering laws for five days hartzer refused to quit telling his senior executives on monday morning the allegations were not an enron or lehman brothers referring to the scandal triggered financial collapses in 2001 and 2008 however the bank s board axed him on monday night after the allegations contributed to a fall in westpac share prices by around 10 percent causing losses totalling almost 10 billion austrac and the corporate media placed the spotlight on accusations that 12 of the transactions were reputedly associated with allowing customers to finance child sexual exploitation activity the crusade was joined by government figures from prime minister scott morrison down and matched by labor party leaders in particular home affairs minister peter dutton who heads the huge police intelligence and border protection apparatus told parliament westpac banking bosses through their negligence have given a free pass to paedophiles and there is a price to pay for that and that price will be paid these dozen transactions however were only the tip of an iceberg whose transactions go far beyond allowing alleged paedophiles to transfer cash across national borders according to westpac chairman lindsay maxsted who has now been forced to retire early the bank did report to austrac its failure to identify 19 5 million international funds transfer instructions over a five year period nevertheless maxsted claimed westpac knew nothing about the child exploitation links until an austrac investigation was completed this month much of the media coverage has focused on the fact that hartzer despite presiding over a mountain of alleged illegal transactions is being permitted to depart largely scot free hartzer will remain westpac ceo until december 2 and be paid his fixed salary of 2 7 million in lieu of 12 months notice he will forgo up to 22 million in short term and long term bonuses but will take with him a parcel of fully paid westpac shares worth 1 6 million hartzer s payout typifies the obscene salaries incentive packages and golden handshakes handed out to top corporate executives and the wealthy elite in contrast to the low pay real wage cuts and sackings inflicted on workers hartzer should have little difficulty in managing he currently lives in a 12 million plus modern mansion in sydney s wealthiest harbourside suburb vaucluse and has a 7 million historic weekend house on pittwater a northern sydney bay hartzer was not ousted over concerns for social equality or justice however nor were the other bank chiefs who have departed since the start of the royal commission closer attention needs to be paid to the underlying forces at work in particular in the case of westpac like the privatised commonwealth bank of australia cba the country s largest bank the allegations relate to violating transaction controls cba ceo ian narev resigned in 2017 after austrac charged cba with almost 54 000 breaches of money laundering laws austrac has charged westpac with some 23 million breaches of the anti money laundering and counter terrorism financing act 2006 which requires westpac to send reports to austrac these transactions totalled 11 billion over five years other charges allege a failure to monitor money movements in and out of australia and a failure to conduct due diligence on customers sending money to countries known for child exploitation risks twelve itemised cases of alleged paedophile activity have been referred to the australian federal police at the heart of the scandal is a remittance service called litepay which westpac launched in 2016 allowing customers to send payments of less than 3 000 to various overseas countries like other banks westpac moved into this profitable trade after kicking rival transfer services off its banking system cynically westpac cited concerns about money laundering and terrorism financing to justify its move westpac was following the lead of its three big four rivals collectively they have reduced the number of firms registered and active in australia s remittance industry from around 800 to 30 such activities permit the banks to share in the multi billion dollar annual global money moving trade that facilitates transfers to tax havens related criminal syndicates drug cartels and in some instances favoured terrorist groups the strike against westpac appears to be related to the rising economic and military tensions produced by the trump administration and its predecessors in their efforts to halt the relative decline of the united states s post world war ii dominance and prevent the rise of potential challengers including china according to the australian broadcasting corporation s ian verrender there are implications here for national and global security westpac had left the door wide open for undetected transactions it had relationships with 16 separate foreign banks in a scheme known as correspondent banking that delivered open access to our banking system with no oversight this could facilitate sanctions busting transactions cutting across crippling restrictions imposed by the us and its allies westpac helped foreign banks open accounts in sanctioned countries such as iraq lebanon ukraine zimbabwe or the democratic republic of the congo verrender reported austrac operates as part of a global tracking network which has been under review by a financial action taskforce initiated by the g7 major world economies that review currently suspended had been expected to criticise australia for delays in extending austrac to cover real estate agents lawyers and accountants at present austrac regulates over 15 000 financial entities including banks credit unions remittance service providers and casinos a spokeswoman for the agency said it obtains data from organisations and operations that attract large amounts of cash or money transfers from gaming gambling and sailing clubs to golf clubs and banks for now the westpac affair has alarmed the finance industry there is speculation in ruling class circles that austrac will impose a fine exceeding 1 billion on westpac according to financial commentators any fine over 1 5 billion could cause problems for the bank in maintaining the capital balances required by government regulators representing the largest corporations operating in the country business council of australia chief executive jennifer westacott said the upheaval would clear the air around westpac but she warned against a new round of bank bashing saying it could restrict the flow of credit to businesses and individuals politically as westacott s concern reflects the scandal adds to the growing popular hostility toward the banks and the financial elite as well as the political establishment that has protected and facilitated their profiteering operations for decades
argentina must repay us 5 billion by the end of 2019 it doesn t have much to work with while the country s foreign reserves total a still somewhat robust us 43 billion that figure shrinks markedly once untouchable assets such as dollar deposits of everyday argentines and a credit line from china are stripped out analysts surveyed by bloomberg news estimate that the amount that policy makers can actually freely spend is no more than us 12 5 billion one of the analysts siobhan morden of amherst pierpont securities puts the figure at as little as us 6 5 billion if you run out of money you run out of money morden who runs the firm s latin america fixed income strategy from new york said in an interview there s serious risk of a hard default next year bond investors are largely prepared for that moment having already driven down the price of some of the government s foreign bonds to less than 40 cents on the dollar but the dire foreign reserves situation indicates the default could come sooner than some expect perhaps shortly after president elect alberto fernández takes office in december morden anticipates argentina will manage to muddle through the end of 2019 though that will come thanks to capital controls that were first imposed after the august presidential primary victory by fernández and his running mate former president cristina fernández de kirchner total reserves have dwindled by about a third from us 66 billion since that vote sent the frente de todos leader a populist with broad promises to improve life for argentines on a path to the presidency the central bank has managed to rebuild reserves by more than us 1 billion by imposing even tighter controls on dollar purchases after fernández s election in october argentina s central bank doesn t publish official data on net reserves so estimates on how much it has left vary net reserves may be closer to us 10 billion including treasury deposits at the central bank and liquid reserves according to ezequiel zambaglione head of strategy at balanz capital valores in buenos aires bank of america strategist sebastian rondeau in new york puts the figure as high as us 12 5 billion while martin castellano at washington s institute of international finance estimates the figure at us 11 2 billion the central bank declined to comment on net reserves interest payments on foreign currency debt total us 3 5 billion through the end of 2019 in addition argentina owes another us 1 5 billion of peso debt finance minister hernán lacunza told el cronista that the nation would meet its financing

by natalia gurushina economist emerging markets fixed income vaneck global china s industrial profits looked very weak in october but there was huge divergence between trade related companies and those that benefit from domestic stimulus argentina s president elect said that he does not need more money from the imf china s industrial profits scared the life out of everybody this morning dropping by 9 9 year on year in october details however show a more nuanced picture sectors that were hit the hardest were mostly trade related nothing surprising here by contrast infrastructure related companies did extremely well stimulus anyone companies that operate in consumer related sectors also showed okay results so while we remain very concerned about a combined negative impact of lower producer prices and still high financing costs on chinese companies especially private and while the outcome of phase 1 of the trade talks can be a game changer the drip stimulus is bringing results and we expect to see more of it in the coming weeks argentina does not need more money from the imf what yes according to president elect alberto fernandez argentina needs more time to develop rather than additional financing from the imf one potential implication is that the incoming administration will be less inclined to tighten the fiscal belt while still mulling things over with the imf even though time is not quite on argentina s side next year s payments to the imf are quite small and this gives the new administration some breathing space while it negotiates with debt holders especially as the central bank is no longer losing the reserves the u s economic exceptionalism was on full display this morning following an upside revision of q3 gdp growth to a solid 2 1 quarter on quarter and stronger than expected capital and durable goods orders for october these last point to a big jump in business equipment demand usually associated with a stronger growth outlook if anything this should further dampen the residual expectations of the federal reserve s rate cut in january please note emerging markets debt daily will not be published november 28 29 we look forward

monthly furniture insights report from smith leonard furniture world news desk on 11 27 2019 monthly results new orders according to our recent survey of residential furniture manufacturers and distributors new orders increased nicely in september up 7 over september 2018 september 2018 orders were up 9 over september 2017 so the comparison to september 2018 was to very good results the last three months have been interesting though as july orders were up 6 over july 2018 then august orders fell 3 from august 2018 the september results left us at new orders being down 1 year to date for september new orders increased over last september for 64 of the participants but new orders year to date were down for 70 of the participants through august new orders year to date were down 2 once again the results for the month continued the choppy business conditions that have been described through a great part of this year shipments and backlogs shipments in september were up 6 over september 2018 but only 55 of the participants reported increased shipments for the month shipments in september were up 7 over august the increase in september brought year to date shipments back to even with last year still some 58 of the participants reported decreased shipments compared to last year as with orders the choppy order rates have affected shipments so participants continue to be up and down with no consistency to the business conditions with orders in dollars exceeding shipment dollars backlogs increased 7 over august backlogs were 5 higher than september a year ago august backlogs were 3 higher than august 2018 receivables and inventories receivable levels in september were even with september 2018 with shipments up 6 over last year we would have expected some increase but with year to date shipments flat the receivable levels make sense it was good to see them back in line after a couple of months of unusual increases reported inventories were 12 higher than september a year ago and even with august levels in august inventories were 14 higher than august 2018 so at least the inventories have leveled off in spite of appearing to be a bit high based on current business conditions factory and warehouse employees and payroll the number of factory and warehouse employees in september was about equal to that of august the number in september was 5 lower than september 2018 down from a 4 decrease noted last month factory and warehouse payrolls were down 1 from september 2018 year to date it appears that the personnel situation is pretty much in line considering current business conditions national consumer confidence the conference board consumer confidence index decreased in november following a slight decline in october the index now stands at 125 5 1985 100 down from 126 1 in october the present situation index based on consumers assessment of current business and labor market conditions decreased from 173 5 to 166 9 the expectations index based on consumers short term outlook for income business and labor market conditions increased from 94 5 last month to 97 9 this month consumer confidence declined for a fourth consecutive month driven by a softening in consumers assessment of current business and employment conditions said lynn franco senior director of economic indicators at the conference board the decline in the present situation index suggests that economic growth in the final quarter of 2019 will remain weak however consumers short term expectations improved modestly and growth in early 2020 is likely to remain at around 2 overall confidence levels are still high and should support solid spending during this holiday season consumers appraisal of current day conditions was less favorable in november the percentage of consumers claiming business conditions are good rose slightly from 39 7 to 40 2 but those claiming business conditions are bad also increased from 11 0 to 13 8 consumers assessment of the job market was less favorable than last month those saying jobs are plentiful decreased from 47 7 to 44 8 while those claiming jobs are hard to get increased from 11 6 to 12 7 consumers were moderately more optimistic about the short term outlook the percentage of consumers expecting business conditions will improve over the next six months decreased slightly from 18 7 to 17 2 while those expecting business conditions will worsen increased slightly from 11 5 to 12 1 consumers outlook for the labor market was mixed the proportion expecting more jobs in the months ahead decreased from 16 9 to 15 7 but those anticipating fewer jobs also decreased from 18 0 to 13 2 regarding their short term income prospects the percentage of consumers expecting an improvement edged up from 21 4 to 21 8 while the proportion expecting a decrease declined from 6 9 to 6 2 leading economic indicators the conference board leading economic index lei for the u s declined 0 1 in october to 111 7 2016 100 following a 0 2 decline in both september and august the u s lei declined for a third consecutive month and its six month growth rate turned negative for the first time since may 2016 the decline was driven by weaknesses in new orders for manufacturing average weekly hours and unemployment insurance claims said ataman ozyildirim senior director of economic research at the conference board the major difference this month is the softening in the labor market whereas conditions in manufacturing remain weak and show no signs of improvement yet taken together the lei suggests that the economy will end the year on a weak note at just below 2 growth the conference board coincident economic index cei for the u s was unchanged in october remaining at 106 5 2016 100 following a 0 1 increase in september and a 0 3 increase in august the conference board lagging economic index lag for the u s increased 0 1 in october to 108 1 2016 100 following a 0 1 increase in september and a 0 6 decline in august gross domestic product real gross domestic product gdp increased at an annual rate of 1 9 in the third quarter of 2019 according to the advance estimate released by the bureau of economic analysis in the second quarter real gdp increased 2 0 the increase in real gdp in the third quarter reflected positive contributions from personal consumption expenditures pce federal government spending residential fixed investment state and local government spending and exports that were partly offset by negative contributions from nonresidential fixed investment and private inventory investment imports which are a subtraction in the calculation of gdp increased the deceleration in real gdp in the third quarter reflected decelerations in pce federal government spending and state and local government spending and a larger decrease in nonresidential fixed investment these movements were partly offset by a smaller decrease in private inventory investment and upturns in exports and in residential fixed investment housing existing home sales existing home sales rose in october a slight recovery from the declines seen in september according to the national association of realtors nar the four major u s regions were split last month with the midwest and the south seeing growth and the northeast and the west both reporting a drop in sales total existing home sales completed transactions that include single family homes townhomes condominiums and co ops increased 1 9 from september to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5 46 million in october despite lingering regional variances overall sales were up 4 6 from a year ago 5 22 million in october 2018 single family home sales were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4 87 million in october down from 4 77

a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 590 000 units in october about even with the previous month and 1 7 lower than a year ago the median existing condo price was 248 500 in october which was an increase of 5 6 from a year ago lawrence yun nar s chief economist said this sales increase is encouraging and he expects added growth in the coming months historically low interest rates continuing job expansion higher weekly earnings and low mortgage rates are undoubtedly contributing to these higher numbers said yun we will likely continue to see sales climb as long as potential buyers are presented with an adequate supply of inventory the median existing home price for all housing types in october was 270 900 up 6 2 from october 2018 255 100 as prices rose in all regions october s price increase marks 92 straight months of year over year gains total housing inventory at the end of october sat at 1 77 million units down approximately 2 7 from september and 4 3 from one year ago 1 85 million unsold inventory sits at a 3 9 month supply at the current sales pace down from 4 1 months in september and from the 4 3 month figure recorded in october 2018 the issuance of more housing permits is a very positive sign and a good step toward more inventory said yun citing the latest data for housing starts in order to better counter and even slow the increase in housing prices home builders will have to bring additional homes on the market properties typically remained on the market for 36 days in october up from 32 days in september and consistent with october 2018 numbers forty six percent of homes sold in october 2019 were on the market for less than a month first time buyers were responsible for 31 of sales in october down from 33 in september and identical to the 31 recorded in october2018 nar s 2019 profile of home buyers and sellers released in late 2019 revealed that the annual share of first time buyers was 33 mortgage rates were trending downward since july

drinking places social assistance and financial activities within manufacturing employment in motor vehicles and parts decreased due to strike activity federal government employment was down reflecting a drop in the number of temporary jobs for the 2020 census both the unemployment rate at 3 6 and the number of unemployed persons at 5 9 million changed little in october the number of long term unemployed those jobless for 27 weeks or more was essentially unchanged at 1 3 million in october and accounted for 21 5 of the unemployed executive summary the results of our surveys of residential furniture manufacturers and distributors have been interesting all year we started the year off with strong orders in january which followed a nice year of growth in 2018 but then february started a string of reduced orders compared to the previous years for five straight months we then saw a pickup in july only to see orders drop 3 in august now we get the september results which showed a 7 increase over september 2018 and remember that september 2018 orders were 9 higher than september 2017 still proving that the term choppy when describing orders continue to be a fair term to use even with orders up 7 orders were only up for 64 of the participants in the month the september results brought year to date orders to a 1 decline compared to last year some 70 of the participants reported a decline in orders year to date shipments in september were up 6 over september 2018 but only 55 of the participants reported increased shipments the increase in september pulled the year to date shipments up from the negative to at least even with last year still some 58 reported lower shipments year to date backlogs increased as the dollar amount of new orders exceeded the dollars shipped backlogs were up 7 over august and 5 higher than september a year ago receivable levels remained in line about even with last year and in line with shipments year to date inventories remained high but dropped to a 12 increase over september 2018 down from a 14 increase reported last month factory and warehouse payrolls and employment remained in line with current business conditions with the number of employees down 5 from last year national consumer confidence the conference board consumer confidence index declined slightly in november after slight declines for the last three months the present situation index declined but the expectations index actually increased the report noted that economic growth for the fourth quarter of 2019 will likely remain weak and that growth in 2020 is likely to remain around 2 consumers were moderately optimistic about the short term outlook those expecting business conditions to improve over the next six months declined slightly and the labor market outlook was mixed but the short term income prospects were favorable the report also noted that overall confidence levels are still high and should support solid spending during the holiday season housing existing home sales rebounded slightly in october after falling in september overall sales were up 4 6 from a year ago single family sales were down slightly but remained 5 4 ahead of october a year ago sales were up nicely from a year ago in all regions up a range of 5 7 to 7 8 although compared to september sales were down slightly in the northeast and west sales of new single family houses were down slightly in october compared to september but up 31 6 from october 2018 all four regions were up significantly from last year but october 2018 sales were down 12 from october 2017 so the comparisons of 2019 to 2018 was to some weak numbers for 2018 housing starts in october were up 3 8 above september 2019 and 8 5 above october 2018 single family starts were down slightly in the midwest and west and down significantly in the northeast starts were up 25 8 in the south other advance estimates of u s retail and food services sales for october increased 0 3 from september and were 3 1 above october 2018 sales at furniture and home furnishings stores were up 0 9 over october 2018 sales at these stores were up 0 1 year to date the consumer price index rose 0 4 in october after being unchanged in september over the last twelve months the all items index increased 1 8 the primary reason for the october increase was that the energy index increased 2 7 after recent monthly declines total non farm employment rose by 128 000 in october the unemployment rate was not changed at 3 6 employment gains were noted in food services and drinking places social assistance and financial activities the latest estimate for gdp growth in the third quarter showed growth of 1 9 after growing at a 2 0 rate in the second quarter thoughts the september results were better than we expected overall but certainly not for all even with the september increase the year to date decrease of 1 in new orders seems to reflect the kind of year it has been we continue to think that the overall economy is good and all the economic factors that support the industry are in good shape in fact retail overall has performed at a better pace but we almost always go back to the fact that most furniture purchases are deferable most of our furniture at home does not have to be replaced immediately so usually housing moves are the reason to buy on a more immediate needs basis so with overall housing results decent but not great that leaves consumers more in the need for replacement items which can be deferred why then are they deferred just listen to the news and hear how bad things supposedly are we know the stock market and overall economy is in pretty good shape but if those positives are even mentioned they are followed by it won t last and bad things are coming those along with all the presidential race information just makes people a bit nervous that said even if 2019 continues at the 2018 pace we have had several years in a row of decent growth so all is not bad it is just not as good as we all want it to be so really it is a time to look for new ideas and products to help you with market share those ideas then convert to retailers and designers being able to show consumers more things they have to have or want to have enough to make them want to buy so let s be thankful for the business we all have happy thanksgiving

u s highlights a quiet holiday shortened week featured data that painted a picture of an economy that has slowed but not stalled revisions to q2 gdp did little to change the picture of the economy durable goods orders were a bright spot but the fed s manufacturing surveys continue to point to a lack of confidence on investment spending the beige book echoed this two speed view of struggles in the factory sector and health elsewhere the consumer remains an area of strength with spending on track to put in a solid performance in q4 helped by healthy advances in wages and salaries and benign inflation canadian highlights the main event this week was friday s third quarter gdp report economic activity rose 1 3 a deceleration from the prior quarter that masked more encouraging details early indicators for the final quarter of 2019 suggest another modest expansion is in store falling confidence and disruptions in several key sectors will act as headwinds to expansion the bank of canada will be content to hold its key policy rate unchanged on wednesday as recent economic trends remain effectively unbroken u s something to be thankful for a relatively quiet holiday shortened week featured data that painted a picture of an economy that has slowed but not stalled revisions to q3 economic growth were uneventful headline gdp growth was revised up from 1 9 annualized to 2 1 largely owing to a build up in inventories rising inventories are not typically a sign of economic strength so we don t view that slight upward boost as changing the picture in a meaningful way final domestic demand was 2 in q3 after averaging 2 7 in the first half of the year and 3 in 2018 that is the narrative right there the economy has slowed from a robust pace to a moderate pace very close to what we consider its underlying trend chart 1 the fed s latest beige book indicated that this tempo has likely continued this quarter it characterized economic activity as progressing at a modest pace through most districts unchanged relative to the prior report consumer related sectors including residential construction are doing well while ongoing struggles in the manufacturing sector continued durable goods orders for october painted a slightly better picture nondefense capital goods orders ex aircraft a key signpost to business investment had a solid gain for the first time in a few months it wasn t enough to change our view of manufacturing weakness but it did support an upgrade to expectations for equipment spending in q4 overall we expect business investment to advance roughly 2 4 ending two quarters of contraction however this does not entirely lift the damper uncertainty is having on investment looking at the regional fed manufacturing surveys the capital expenditures components on the whole weakened further in november so we don t believe business spending or the manufacturing sector is out of the woods yet on the plus side the october personal spending data suggests that the consumer is looking solid at the start of the fourth quarter barring a confidence sapping event we expect consumer spending to come in around 2 4 in line with our september forecast the gray cloud in the october data was a drop in real personal disposable income however that seems to have been due to a decline in farm incomes after a sizeable boost from government payouts to compensate farmers for tariff related damages wages and salaries still rose 0 4 on the month and was up 4 9 versus a year ago nominal terms a pretty healthy pace particularly when overlaid on the benign inflation backdrop the fed s preferred inflation measure the core pce deflator rose only 0 1 in october chart 2 the dallas fed s trimmed mean which strips out price volatility more broadly than food and energy has been steady at the fed s 2 target for a few months there s little on the inflation front to spook the fed to either cut or raise interest rates any time soon early in the week chair powell highlighted the benefits of extending the current economic cycle mainly that lower income households have not yet regained the wealth lost in the great recession strong labor markets are finally starting to spark healthy wage gains for lower income workers which spreads the gains from a strong economy more broadly amid all the trade gloom and uncertainty that is something to be thankful for canada solid end to a quiet week it was a relatively quiet week in financial markets as u s traders took their thanksgiving break the tsx looked set to end the week a tiny bit higher at the time of writing while the loonie sat close to where it started the week there was a bit more excitement on the politics front this week saw some signs of progress towards getting the canada u s mexico cusma trade deal officially on the books deputy pm freeland and her mexican counterpart were in washington this week reportedly to assess potential labour related tweaks to the agreement the path to full ratification of this deal has been a bumpy one getting it officially on the books would finally remove at least one source of uncertainty for manufacturers and exporters turning to the economic data this week s calendar was dominated by friday s third quarter gdp release the report was a pleasant surprise at 1 3 quarterly annualized growth the headline came in a bit ahead of our expectations and the details were even better chart 1 final domestic demand rose a robust 3 2 as almost every major category rose this quarter also brought statistics canada s major revisions where they incorporate important but lagged data such as tax returns these revisions suggested a more resilient economy than thought among the positive revisions were slightly stronger business investment notably on non residential structures and a higher household savings rate than previously reported looking ahead to the close of the year early signs point to a similar headline performance although perhaps with softer details small business confidence dropped markedly in november chart 2 driven lower by alberta and saskatchewan the early read suggests that another quarter of lukewarm overall activity is likely reinforcing this view are a number of one off surprises affecting key sectors the u s gm strike affected their canadian operations and should show up as a headwind to the manufacturing sector early in the quarter more recently the now resolved labour disruption at cn rail was thankfully shorter than we anticipated however with eight days of disruption in an industry where opportunities for catch up growth are limited there are only so many trains cars lines we still expect a modest 0 1 percentage point drag on the quarter as a result this brings us to the next big event this coming wednesday s bank of canada interest rate decision holding the overnight interest rate at 1 75 is pretty much a foregone conclusion why the bank has already pencilled in a soft end to 2019 forecasting 1 3 growth in both q3 and q4 in their october monetary policy report and will likely be pleasantly surprised by the details of the gdp data especially the strength in business investment what s more recent speeches have emphasized the financial stability risks in the canadian economy the bar to easing is clearly higher than in the past but it is not stratospheric should consumer spending or housing take a tumble or financial conditions tighten rapidly the narrative would quickly change but with the final rate decision of 2019 right around the corner that will have to be a 2020 story u s upcoming key economic

rising to 49 2 from 48 3 given recent optimism on trade discussions and the firming of some regional surveys including chicago and philadelphia on the contrary and largely reflecting a recent

consensus na the international trade deficit is forecast to widen to 2 0bn in october owing to a sizeable drag from motor vehicle exports the uaw strike and ensuring parts shortage weighed heavily on canadian vehicle production and preliminary figures show a pullback in line with the 6 m m drop in us auto imports this should contribute to a broader decline in export activity with forestry products expected to edge lower in response to reduced activity at lumbermills while lower oil prices will also act as a headwind to nominal exports imports should see a more modest decline consistent with softer us exports and sluggish domestic demand canadian employment november release date december 6 2019 previous 2k unemployment rate 5 5 td forecast 10k unemployment rate 5 6 consensus na td looks for the labour market to underwhelm with a 10k decline in employment for november driven by a unwind of election related hiring after public administration employment rose by 20k in october financial sector employment currently running at 5 5 y y also looks prime for some giveback after a 17k increase last month while unseasonably cool weather will weigh on construction hiring on the other end of the spectrum manufacturing employment should rebound from a 23k drop after the resolved uaw strike allowed canadian workers to return to the job however this could be partially offset by the scheduled winddown of gm s oshawa plant should our forecast prove accurate the 6m trend would slip from 22k to 16k the softest pace since mid 2018 with declines in four of those six months this would push the unemployment rate back to 5 6 assuming modest labour force growth while muted base effects should see wage growth hold at 4 4 y y

but is it a question of age and stamina to carry on alone that has made john think of hanging his boots and saying itâ s time for young blood to take his virile place or is it the shock defeat that has given his ego a battering too severe to withstand for there is no big generation gap between this 79 year old former minister and the newly elected 70 year old president or the newly appointed 74 year old prime minister and the 77 year old state minister of defence now is there and see how remarkably well they are doing no complaints of aches and pains and no grumblings about age catching up now is there power is not only a great aphrodisiac but also seems to be the elixir of youth he said â i have been in parliament for 41 years and i feel that the time is ripe for me to retire from politics contesting for an election is no easy task because now you have to contest for the whole district i have done it about four or five times and i am now fagged out firstly enormous sums of money is needed to contest an election today and it is quite tiring an exercise so if there is any younger person ready to step into my shoes iâ m quite ready to let him this is not something that we should cling to for life there comes a time when we must let go â on thursday he spoke to the media on why it is necessary for him to call it a day and make way for a younger person who can perform better than him after sajith premadasaâ s presidential defeat gone limp seems to be amaratungaâ s once stiff resolve to never go down without a fight but to keep his spirit raised even beyond the climactic hour but age seems to have taken its toll and big john seems to have finally come to terms with life and realized that â the younger rises when the old doth fallâ
back in 2004 thomas frank s book what s the matter with kansas elevated the state as the textbook case of how the republican party has been able to leverage a platform of conservative social values to sway the electorate to vote against its economic interests railing against abortion affirmative action big government elitism political correctness and the like republicans surfed the wave of voters cultural outrage to election victories and then performed the bait and switch as frank tells the story these officials instead of delivering on these platforms engaged in unbridled deregulation and tax cuts gutting the public sphere on which people depended such as the educational system and concentrating wealth in a fewer and fewer hands at the people s expense in 2018 kansas voters suddenly got woke deciding they were mad as hell and not going to take it anymore they elected democrats laura kelly as governor and sharice davids to the house of representatives they felt the reality of republican governor sam brownback s kansas where it became apparent that lo and behold massive tax cuts did not pay for themselves much less increase state revenues but rather resulted in severe austerity conditions for example the school year was shortened due to revenue shortfalls attributable to his criminally huge corporate tax cuts exposing that these republican fiscal and tax policies were not benefiting the economic health of the state or creating a higher quality of life brownback s cuts to education were so egregious that they were deemed unconstitutional by the state s supreme court bobby jindal wreaked similar havoc in louisiana back in 2016 granting massive tax cuts to the wealthy and corporations leaving the state in economic chaos and facing massive cuts to education and basic social services republican governor of illinois bruce rauner followed the same playbook razing the state s public sphere in the name of restoring economic health by lowering taxes and destroying unions to get more stories like this subscribe to our newsletter the daily as i wrote back then voters paying attention should have seen what the gop had in store for them should a republican win the presidency in 2016 and trump has indeed realized this vision lavishing exorbitant tax cuts to the wealthiest among us and to corporations resulting in the accelerating deterioration of the economy as well as gutting the public sphere his budget cut proposals as well as the policies of his education secretary betsy devos continue to assault funding for public education making quality public education including higher education more expensive and less accessible both davids and kelly campaigned strongly on the need to support public education in the wake of brownback s devastation of public schools the people responded democrat andy beshear just recently defeated always trumper incumbent governor matt bevin largely by many accounts because of his support for teachers and public education while bevin ran on a platform that refused to increase education budgets while he also outright slandered and insulted teachers these models of democrats flipping staunchly red states blue need to be heeded on the national stage by those seeking the democratic nomination to run for president let s remember what happened in kansas in particular remember that bernie sanders and alexandria ocasio cortez supported davids opponent brent welder in the democratic primary because he championed medicare for all while davids did not davids a graduate of cornell law school instead emphasized the importance of the quality public education she received and the accessibility of a quality community college that helped her fulfill her dreams her platform while simply stated promised transformation of great magnitude people understood because they had seen and experienced the conditions of a vibrant and meaningful public sphere that supported their lives and to which all fairly contributed to make possible and they had seen it taken away from them to provide tax cuts for the wealthy so conservative kansas voters elected a native american lesbian candidate to the house of representatives kelly similarly had a record of trumpeting the value of the public sphere and of public service in addition to other offices she had been director of the kansas recreation and park association for 19 years an honest to god real life leslie knope committed to public service and to a public sphere parks schools services that make people s lives better and which we all pay for and share a recent study showed that the vast majority of americans do not realize that states have engaged in a substantial disinvestment in public education particularly public higher education in real dollars states collectively cut spending on higher education by 16 percent between 2008 and 2017 with 8 students cutting funding by 30 percent or more these cuts account for the extra inflationary rise in tuitions at state institutions putting greater burdens on students and families and ballooning student loan debts based on election results in kentucky and kansas those seeking the democratic candidacy for president might be well served to tell this story about an issue the vast majority of americans care about the sounds of trump s silence on public education have been audible to the point of being deafening indeed when in 2018 teachers from west virginia arizona kentucky oklahoma and colorado effectively engaged in mass strikes the likes of which our nation has not witnessed since the 1930s trump said not a word to acknowledge or in any way address both the lagging teacher salaries in those states or the woefully low levels of funding for public education which was also a major impetus behind the teachers mass actions this year has witnessed massive teachers strikes already in denver los angeles and oakland for similar reasons trump s proposed budget for 2020 however loudly announced his administration s objective to undermine public education especially public higher education calling for a deep and brutal cut of 7 1 billion dollars the budget will not be enacted but nonetheless reveals trump s priorities and overall thinking about what constitutes effective and responsible fiscal behavior in terms of what we spend and don t what we view as investment and how best to grow the economy kentucky and kansas show voters in red states don t share these priorities democrats need to listen

a few blocks from grosvenor square in mayfair 46 park lane resembles a private club with wood paneled walls and an ornate fireplace dating back to britain s victorian era but down a flight of stairs is one of the most secure rooms in london built by ibv international vaults the steel walled stronghold is scheduled to open next month and will cater to billionaires looking for a place to stash their most prized possessions we re getting calls every week about a room available for 2 5 million pounds a year said sean hoey managing director of ibv london referring to an apartment size space the firm which also has 550 safe deposit boxes on site and room for about 450 more is betting on london s reputation as a safe haven even with brexit advertisement this will be ibv s sixth location and it s hardly the only such firm fielding queries from the wealthy from london to switzerland to parts of the u s the rich are looking to store precious metals cash and cryptocurrency for some it s the threat of a global recession others are avoiding bank deposits as negative interest rates force lenders to charge for holding cash many are concerned about natural disasters hedge fund titan ray dalio captured the anxiety last month when he warned the global economy is under threat from an explosive mix of ineffective monetary policy a widening wealth gap and climate change a majority of wealthy investors are stockpiling cash in anticipation of a sharp market drop before the end of next year according to a survey of clients from ubs global wealth management we ve seen extraordinary demand for safe deposit boxes ever since we started offering them in 2015 and that demand has really gone up since the late summer said ludwig karl a spokesman for swiss gold safe ltd which operates high security alpine vaults most people say they are planning for difficult economic circumstances it s a similar story for sincona trading ag a precious metals dealer with more than 1 000 safe deposit boxes for rent in zurich switzerland it had scores of empty boxes three years ago but now it s renting about five a day said benoit schoeni a managing director there has been an extreme demand he said it won t take too long until we re full up safe deposit boxes can range from a few centimeters in height to the size of a kitchen cabinet another option are free ports warehouses in tax free zones such as singapore geneva and delaware favored for storing art but which typically limit the amount of time that pieces can be held advertisement there are more than 25 million safe deposit boxes by some estimates in the u s alone they can be used for the mundane to the exotic a private collector held the crown of the andes made with 5 3 pounds of gold and more than 400 emeralds in a citibank box before its sale four years ago to the metropolitan museum of art still for many banks they re no longer a core offering the amount of space they require is one deterrent that s especially the case in london home to the world s largest population of wealthy individuals according to real estate broker knight frank in the city center few places have secure storage facilities as large as ibv s on park lane where customers can also purchase gold coins from across the globe in the u s safe deposit boxes also have largely fallen out of favor as banks close branches and opt not to install them in new ones demand has waned in recent years according to jpmorgan chase co and bank of america corp the nation s two largest lenders much of the decline can be attributed to clients opting to store documents online especially younger clients said bank of america spokesman don vecchiarello but there s revived interest as fears of weather disasters and wildfires have prompted more people to secure their valuables said jerry pluard founder of safe deposit box insurance coverage the boxes are also an option for cannabis businesses that are locked out of the u s banking system because marijuana remains illegal at the federal level he said advertisement some swiss firms are also seeing demand driven by central bank policy negative interest rates have left switzerland s banks caught between the prospect of losing money to hold client deposits and imposing fees that could chase customers away ubs group ag the world s biggest wealth manager and rival credit suisse group ag announced plans this year to expand measures for charging rich clients for holding excess cash to some these extra costs have made the safe deposit box a viable alternative a spokeswoman for ubs s switzerland bank which operates almost 250 000 safe deposit boxes nationwide said demand from clients has declined in recent years the storage cost for cash is cheaper than negative interest rates swiss gold safe s karl said the firm offers six box sizes with the largest renting for 4 039 swiss francs a year cash storage has become a strong business for us some bankers said the desire for safe deposit boxes makes little sense to avoid charges on their accounts the wealthy can spread their cash across multiple banks clients also need to buy insurance in case something happens to the money such as a fire safe deposit box firms sometimes subsidize that extra cost with ibv london offering 100 000 pounds of complimentary insurance for each hired container the proliferation of nonbanks providing safe deposit boxes has prompted some swiss lawmakers to question whether they re providing a safe haven for wrongdoing such as money laundering noting they don t face the same level of scrutiny and regulatory oversight as traditional banks storing large sums of cash in safe deposit boxes demands a checklist of tasks those include arranging transport of the money and keeping detailed records of its location to avoid raising suspicions over money laundering if the cash ever returns to a bank account moreover failing to strictly adhere to a safe deposit firm s protocols may result in being rejected as a customer advertisement the even bigger issue is getting the cash back into your account said felix brill chief investment officer of liechtenstein based vp bank which manages about 50 billion of assets and offers some safe deposit boxes still no one likes to pay negative interest rates everyone looks for alternatives safe deposit boxes aren t always a fail safe in 2015 burglars drilled through the wall of an underground vault in london s hatton garden diamond district making off with 20 million of jewelry a year earlier a customer of a wells fargo co branch in highland park n j lost millions of dollars of rare watches that had been stored in a safe deposit box the new york times reported in july ironically heists and scandals can boost other firms offering safe deposit boxes as the rich hunt even more secure places to stash their prized possessions christopher barrow chief executive of london based metropolitan safe deposits said his company spent more than 3 million to build a facility that opened this year in southwest london hatton garden was a classic case said barrow whose firm has more than 15 000 safe deposit boxes in central london alone there was a flight to quality on the back of it
don t miss out on the headlines from world followed categories will be added to my news a series of protests have been escalating across latin america in recent months millions of people have taken to the streets to rail against their governments economic inequality political corruption and an array of other issues prompting mass transit breakdowns and a brutal response from police earlier this month some media outlets began using the term latin american spring comparing these protests to the arab spring uprising that began in 2011 the guardian described it as a howl of rage while bloomberg said latin america is in revolt as waves of protest can be felt across the region from venezuela down to chile here s your guide to what s going on why are latin americans protesting protests in latin america are getting worse as citizens stand up to political corruption and a lack of delivery on economic promises the protests in several countries have been sparked largely by frustration with corruption economic inequality and governments that are perceived to be imposing austerity measures without regard for the daily hardship of many citizens in bolivia protesters first took to the streets over a disputed election that former president evo morales said he had won mr morales later resigned after an international audit found irregularities in the vote and he lost support of the military venezuela once one of latin america s most prosperous nations the oil rich country has plummeted into crisis under its socialist president while venezuela has the world s largest proven oil reserves a fall in prices coupled with corruption and mismanagement under two decades of socialist rule have left the country in chaos most migrants say they are fleeing venezuela s imploding economy mr maduro regularly dismisses the migration figures as fake news created to justify foreign intervention in venezuela s affairs he also urged his country s people to stop cleaning toilets abroad and return home organised protests have taken place since january this year as a co ordinated effort to drive mr maduro out of the top job he was re elected in may in a vote that dozens of foreign governments described as rigged but he insists the election was free and fair and says the situation was the result of an economic war led by the opposition and business leaders who are arbitrarily raising prices venezuela has been in turmoil for the whole year chile in recent years chile has been considered relatively stable but in october this year that all changed it all started over a fair hike for public transport young chileans began protesting on october 18 last month after ticket prices went up 30 pesos or about 3 per cent students called for mass fare evasions and protests using the hashtag evasionmasiva which led to thousands of people swarming metro stations across the country and avoiding payments this quickly escalated into broader demonstrations at the end of october more than a million people marched through the streets of chile s capital santiago the country has now entered its sixth consecutive week of protests marking the worst crisis in three decades of chilean democracy with over two dozen people dead furious chileans have been protesting social and economic inequality and against an entrenched political elite that comes from a small number of the wealthiest families in the country among other issues chile has been marred by protests since october colombia over the past week hundreds of thousands of colombians have taken to the streets in protest against president iván duque and his right wing government the protests were triggered by a rumoured proposal to cut pensions though the government never formally confirmed this it marked one of the largest mass demonstrations the country has seen in recent years criticising the government s lack of action on economic inequality and corruption various groups of protesters came together environmental and animal rights groups women s rights groups and people from a vast array of industries protesting economic inequality the protests started out peaceful but before nightfall police began firing tear gas three people died amid social unrest according to official government figures the government assigned soldiers to monitor the streets protesters say they have been motivated by recent events in ecuador and chile where weeks of sustained demonstrations forced the governments of those countries to change some of their economic policies over the past week hundreds of thousands of colombians have taken to the streets in protest against president iván duque and his right wing government ecuador in early october massive anti government protests took place in ecuador prompting a violent response from police that marked some of the worst unrest the country has seen in more than a decade protests began on october 3 after president lenin moreno cut petrol subsidies that had been in place in the country for 40 years in a move which saw the price of diesel and petrol spike overnight transportation unions organised a national strike blocking roads and highways which brought the country to a standstill mass protests followed with thousands from various unions and human rights organisations joining forces to demand the government reverse its reforms and cuts haiti haitians have been protesting almost every day since early september calling for the resignation of president jovenel moïse and protesting against corruption inflation and the scarcity of basic goods just last week at least four people were shot and wounded during a protest in the country s capital including a local journalist as several hundred people marched through affluent neighbourhoods mr moïse has rejected repeated calls to resign the country is more than divided the country is torn apart he said in a recent speech we ask for unity between the rich and the poor between those of the top and the bottom between the people with black skin and light skin between rural and urban if we were united as one we would not see exploitation of a small group while the majority stand in misery poverty and insecurity this is not what our ancestors wanted protests have been going on non stop in haiti for months how long will the protests last according to the latin america risk report the situation in latin american is only set to worsen in 2020 anger at the political systems isn t going away and in many ways governments are trapped there will be more protests and they ll be more violent in 2020 said the newsletter s author james bosworth mr bosworth warned the protests will most likely continue and expand around the region noting protesters will be emboldened by the success in neighbouring countries he notes that most of the protesting countries haven t finished yet and that one of the model countries of the region chile has now too succumbed to protest having seen protests begin there are strong reasons to believe they will continue and expand around the region says bosworth many countries seem to be on edge waiting for a catalyst to light the fire and as protesters have seen success in neighbouring countries they have been emboldened to call for similar protests in their own countries originally published as why protests have been intensifying across latin america
madrid pablo iglesias and his podemos party burst onto the spanish political scene in 2015 by winning more than one fifth of the vote in their first national election igniting dreams of overtaking the socialists as the largest left wing party and reshaping the government instead after his meteoric rise mr iglesias faced internal party tensions and endured the same kind of criticism of his leadership and lifestyle that he had long thrown at a political establishment he called the caste support for his party has fallen sharply yet mr iglesias 41 now looks likely to get his first chance to at least share power under a deal that would see him take the post of deputy prime minister and his party become the junior partne r in a government headed by the more moderate socialist leader prime minister pedro sánchez with sharp rivalries and policy differences it is an uneasy alliance and the road ahead for mr iglesias could be every bit as rocky as the last few years have been but if mr sánchez can win parliamentary approval for his proposed coalition it would make spain one of the few european countries and easily the largest where far left ministers form part of government

struggle from haiti ecuador and peru to chile until one month ago an oasis of neoliberal governance people are taking to the streets in protest their anger is directed not only against their governments but even more so against a system that causes unspeakable hardship for most while creating obscene profits for a few people have had it with the rampant inequality and with barely being able to survive in countries that according to all economic indicators are seemingly doing fine these protests pose a formidable challenge to the decade of neo conservative and neoliberal dominance in the region the governments of jair bolsonaro in brazil the de facto president and putschist jeanine añez in bolivia lenin moreno in ecuador sebastián piñera in chile and iván duque in colombia are all part of this new technocratic and neoliberal far right that flirts with the dictatorial penchants of the old far right racism misogyny homophobia religious fundamentalism class supremacy a foaming at mouth anti socialist rhetoric and a venal attitude towards res publica are traits they have in common they are part of a club that exchanges advisers in an aggressive crusade against populism and squarely subordinated to the dictates of the usa presidency incapable of original ideas they repeat the same blabber day and night property patriarchal family religion fatherland and other mumbo jumbo iván duque incompetent in chief there are signs however that the tables are turning across the region there is a surge in anti neoliberal protests cornering these authoritarian puppets even though the far right in bolivia and venezuela maintains its offensive capacity emboldened by their patrons in europe and the us it has certainly lost the momentum now it is the colombian government s turn to face the anger of the people authoritarian repressive venal and most of all incompetent president iván duque has managed in just one year to become one of the most if not the most unpopular presidents in colombian history rejected by 70 percent of the population it is an incredible feat in a country whose history is awash with presidents who have had set the unpopularity bar pretty high duque was elected in early 2018 as the heir to former president alvaro uribe another nasty far right figure surrounded by scandal his campaign relied on fear of venezuela of the marginalized and of the left he gathered the support of the most conservative and reactionary elements of a society intoxicated with anti venezuela and anti socialist propaganda once in power he has been a quarrelsome bully who attacks venezuela the same week of the frustrated aid convoy s shenanigans in february the colombian government denied humanitarian aid to afro colombians suffering from floods in the impoverished chocó region he unilaterally terminated the peace negotiations with the eln the second largest guerrilla group in colombia and he has systematically undermined the peace agreement with the former farc ep guerrillas he is reigniting armed conflict through military operations against insurgents with disastrous humanitarian consequences murdered children and economic incentives for soldiers to kill as many guerrillas as possible these decisions led to the resignation of his minister of defense on top of that he has come back to the old policy of criminalization of the cocaleros coca leaf farmers in spite of the unfulfilled promises of alternatives to illicit crops in the 2016 peace agreement all of this is happening in the midst of high unemployment rates the skyrocketing cost of living and murders of social leaders members of opposition parties and demobilized guerrillas after just one year duque s record is nothing short of appalling and naturally the people have had enough 21n fury and repression a national civic strike paro cívico was called for november 21 to protest against some of duque s policies such as proposed labor reforms that would reduce the already unsustainable minimum income and privatize the pension system a civic strike is a form of protest in a country where most of the population does not have formal employment and therefore cannot engage in collective action at the workplace everyone comes out to the streets to protest in any way they can workers go on strike students do not attend classes people in marginalized communities block the roads etc the comité nacional de paro national committee for the civic strike an umbrella organization of indigenous agrarian civic and labor organizations made the call in october to protest corruption the cost of living and the revenue reform with broad public support they called for the defense of the right to social protest an end to repression and militarization and action against unemployment which borders on 11 percent without accounting for sub employment and the informal economy that together make up for over 50 percent of the labor force remarkably most of the left wing parties in colombia including the farc party have taken a lukewarm stance towards the strike probably being too busy with the past elections in october they have failed to grasp the significance of this post electoral movement brewing on the streets before the strike even started the authorities arrested and raided organizers homes oblivious of the depths of popular anger and indignation duque accused boogeymen of organizing the protest from international anarchists to the são paulo forum a demobilized farc ep guerrilla explained to roar people are really fed up of it all students and workers can t stand this any longer but the government can t say anymore look it s the guerrillas the narco terrorists infiltrating these protests they are afraid so they are making up new boogeymen to repress discredit and dismiss the protesters the government closed the borders militarized the big towns and threatened the organizers they even banned a document published by a student collective that gave tips on preventing abuses by the esmad the colombian riot police soon after the president clumsily acknowledged that protesters may have a point or two but this was too little too late by then his cocktail of repressive measures and arrogance had already incensed much of the population duque then blatantly lied denying he ever planned a pension system reform or a reduction of the minimum wage at this stage however the die was cast despite the terror tactics used by the government and the atmosphere of fear it created hundreds of thousands if not millions from across the country came out to protest not just for specific demands but even more so because they are fed up with the neoliberal capitalist system and colombia s ruling cliques profiting from it unlike protests in the previous decade which were mainly dominated by rural unrest and agitation the civic national strike was a predominantly urban phenomenon albeit with the participation of several agrarian organizations as expected repression came swiftly the joint action of the esmad and the military left three dead in cauca valley on november 21 plus hundreds arrested and injured across the country confrontations in the city of cali were particularly fierce in response neighborhoods of la macarena and candelaria in bogotá started spontaneous cacerolazos pot banging protests which spread all over the city and to the rest of the country the next day demonstrations and blockades continued and the esmad clashed with protestors in the working class quarters of the main towns pro government activists started a social network campaign to cause panic claiming that vandals were attacking private houses to discourage people from joining the protests and painting those who did join as vigilantes the government s response was a full militarization of the capital tanks and about 4 000 soldiers patrolled the streets of bogotá declaring a curfew from 9pm to 6am on friday night people disobeyed the curfew en masse and came out at night for more cacerolazos and to dance in the streets but the repression continued particularly in working class quarters however gilberto martínez member of the executive board of the cut colombia central unitaria de trabajadores the country s largest trade union explained to roar people are no longer afraid so people face and respond to aggression people faced the esmad they came together on the streets escalating rural protests inasmuch as there is a tendency to rightly view the recent events in colombia in the context of the global struggles against the cost of living corruption and neoliberal austerity of the last decade these struggles are also part of an internal cycle of protest in colombia that started in 2008 that year sugar cane cutters in southwestern colombia went on a three month strike followed by mass mobilization of indigenous communities known as minga collective effort in various indigenous languages since then protests and popular mobilizations have been on the rise particularly in rural regions urban protest has been limited to the huge student demonstrations of 2011 and the heroic but isolated struggles of various trade unions that are often attacked by hit men and death squads accounting for colombia s status as world leader in the murder of trade unionists led by agrarian unions and indigenous communities rural colombia experienced a period of popular mass mobilization opposing the militarization of the countryside confronting unsuccessfully various free trade agreements with the us and the eu and most importantly opposing the implementation of megaprojects in the agricultural and mining sectors it was this resistance best exemplified in the struggles of the tolima communities against gold mining giant anglo gold ashanti which connected peasants with urban masses through the environmental movement escalating rural protest coupled with increasingly effective insurgent attacks against the military particularly by the farc ep provided the backdrop for the launch of the peace negotiations between this rebel movement and the colombian government in late 2012 alas its transformative potential was squandered by isolating the population from the negotiations that took place in cuba by not insisting on broader popular participation and by limiting its scope to issues that were in the constitution anyway such as the government insisting that the economic model was not to be touched and the farc ep negotiating team accepting this ultimately the government s reluctance to implement any substantial change combined with a guerrilla movement which by and large saw mass participation in the dialogues as a threat to their ownership of the process resulted in a restricted non transformative peace agreement in 2016 in 2013 a series of rural protests started by coffee farmers in march and followed by mobilizations of cocaleros in the border region with venezuela in june led to a mass agrarian strike against the free trade agreement with the usa signed the previous year this rural protest brought millions out to the streets and gathered unprecedented support in urban centers after some 25 people died and many hundreds were arrested and injured the government agreed to negotiate with the agrarian unions separately by economic activity and region thus the collective power that had been built up over the course of a month of protests was successfully fragmented and contained the traditional left and their movements possibly alarmed at the independence of the movement opted to turn away from sustained protest discrediting direct action as undermining the santos government and therefore the peace process instead they focused on a futile electoral strategy which rendered the poorest of results the following year they did not understand that the anger in the streets is seldom channeled through the ballot box to a degree the peace process which had been described as an attempt at pacification by left wing critics plus the electoralist strategy of the left curbed the 2008 2013 tendency to the escalation of social protest but this was to be only temporary what now learning the lessons of a long history of struggle the current protests are the biggest since september 1977 when a civic strike against the high costs of living militarization and repression and depressed salaries was violently repressed by the state the 1978 security statute significantly empowered the military and authorized martial courts for the opposition afterwards para state mechanisms of repressions i e death squads proliferated and the hideous practice of forced disappearance commenced one sector of the left thought that an urban insurrection would merge imminently with the rural guerrilla movement an interpretation that although it proved to be wrong was not completely baseless in light of the events in nicaragua guerrilla cells multiplied as the security statute and the wholesale repression following the 1977 civic strike moved many left wing militants to join armed struggle as they saw the space for democratic political opposition shrinking it is a well known pattern in colombia that popular mobilization leads to state repression and repression leads to a growth in number and size of guerrilla movements urban centers remained however by and large a difficult nut to crack for guerrillas the traditional left wing regarded the events as an opportunity to gather votes and as a sign of the people moving towards the left however they too would be disappointed after their poor electoral performance in 1978 where to now as the number of guerrillas who reject the 2016 farc ep agreement with the government continues to grow it is clear that under the current conditions and given the government s unwillingness to fulfill its duties as outlined in the peace agreement there is a very real threat of renewed armed struggle in the countryside however the urban centers have a completely different dynamic and the insurrectionary logic is not likely to bring about the changes expected by the vast majority of the population likewise people in colombia do not necessarily express their anger and frustration through the ballot box therefore the conclusions from 1977 of both the insurrectionary left and of the traditional left are not applicable to the present although it would be extremely unwise to dismiss the power of the far right of uribismo it is clear that whatever legitimacy it had has been nullified in the eyes of most people but if a progressive alternative does not fill this vacuum the doors will be opened for an authoritarian solution to the crisis of hegemony just as it happened in 1977 78 in this respect martínez of the cut stated that we are trying to keep up with permanent actions this 21st was a magnificent display of fighting spirit there were cacerolazos all across the country so repression will likely get worse because we have a far right government but people are not taking it anymore but without a clear direction people don t know where to go what s going to happen and we need to be prepared given the past experience it would also be unwise to rely on the ballot box for an appropriate response to this crisis the fighting spirit of the people needs to be organized independently around their most immediate demands committees for pensioners for the youth for women for the myriad of demands they need to be organized to exercise pressure and engage in direct action what was fought out on the streets needs to be won on the streets they also need to act as one and no particular sector should engage separately in negotiations as happened in 2014 unity is key the labor movement needs to be strong and lead by example vis à vis the scale of the moral crisis of the political establishment there is a need for the people to constitute power from below talking to roar an activist from the working class quarters of cali remarked that things are heating up people now believe that this can actually change but we need to be firm and demand that duque resigns at once we do not have nothing to negotiate with him why should we he never keeps his promises he will only use negotiations as a diversion so people sign up agreement they will never fulfill this government has to fall this warning becomes relevant now that the government is calling for a national dialogue in all likelihood to wear down the movement agrarian activist from putumayo explained we have always held that this is a mafia state but then whenever we are called to sit down with them for a coffee we run to their presence and thus we legitimate it we need to be more coherent than that martínez of the cut also emphasized on tuesday 26 the executive committee of the civic strike will reach a decision on the proposal the government is talking of a national agreement with the demagogues not really with the people s organizations we don t need any more promises they know our demands social welfare labor rights dialogue for the government is a way to end up imposing their own views we should not be naive about this the latest colombian crisis is far from resolved the challenge for the popular sectors consist of keeping the momentum turning anger into organization slogans into concrete proposals to be fought and won on the streets and to remain united and avoid fragmentation at the same time pointless negotiations designed as strategies of attrition need to be avoided and the same goes for provocations that try to put segments of the people against one another a wave of agrarian unrest is in the making for next year when it will hopefully merge with this new generation of urban rebels who learned their lessons the hard way then the chance to give a mortal blow to the far right will be at hand if colombia s oligarchy really thinks this is just a passing mood to be smashed through deception and repression they have another thing coming josé antonio gutiérrez d 26 november 2019 related link a specter is haunting latin america the specter of class struggle from haiti ecuador and peru to chile until one month ago an oasis of neoliberal governance people are taking to the streets in protest their anger is directed not only against their governments but even more so against a system that causes unspeakable hardship for most while creating obscene profits for a few people have had it with the rampant inequality and with barely being able to survive in countries that according to all economic indicators are seemingly doing fine these protests pose a formidable challenge to the decade of neo conservative and neoliberal dominance in the region the governments of jair bolsonaro in brazil thepresident andjeanine añez in bolivia lenin moreno in ecuador sebastián piñera in chile and iván duque in colombia are all part of this new technocratic and neoliberal far right that flirts with the dictatorial penchants of the old far right racism misogyny homophobia religious fundamentalism class supremacy a foaming at mouth anti socialist rhetoric and a venal attitude towardsare traits they have in common they are part of a club that exchanges advisers in an aggressive crusade against populism and squarely subordinated to the dictates of the usa presidency incapable of original ideas they repeat the same blabber day and night property patriarchal family religion fatherland and other mumbo jumbo there are signs however that the tables are turning across the region there is a surge in anti neoliberal protests cornering these authoritarian puppets even though the far right in bolivia and venezuela maintains its offensive capacity emboldened by their patrons in europe and the us it has certainly lost the momentum now it is the colombian government s turn to face the anger of the people authoritarian repressive venal and most of all incompetent president iván duque has managed in just one year to become one of the most if not the most unpopular presidents in colombian history rejected by 70 percent of the population it is an incredible feat in a country whose history is awash with presidents who have had set the unpopularity bar pretty high duque was elected in early 2018 as the heir to former president alvaro uribe another nasty far right figure surrounded by scandal his campaign relied on fear of venezuela of the marginalized and of the left he gathered the support of the most conservative and reactionary elements of a society intoxicated with anti venezuela and anti socialist propaganda once in power he has been a quarrelsome bully who attacks venezuela the same week of the frustrated aid convoy s shenanigans in february the colombian government denied humanitarian aid to afro colombians suffering from floods in the impoverished chocó region he unilaterally terminated the peace negotiations with the eln the second largest guerrilla group in colombia and he has systematically undermined the peace agreement with the former farc ep guerrillas he is reigniting armed conflict through military operations against insurgents with disastrous humanitarian consequences murdered children and economic incentives for soldiers to kill as many guerrillas as possible these decisions led to the resignation of his minister of defense on top of that he has come back to the old policy of criminalization of the cocaleros coca leaf farmers in spite of the unfulfilled promises of alternatives to illicit crops in the 2016 peace agreement all of this is happening in the midst of high unemployment rates the skyrocketing cost of living and murders of social leaders members of opposition parties and demobilized guerrillas after just one year duque s record is nothing short of appalling and naturally the people have had enough a national civic strike paro cívico was called for november 21 to protest against some of duque s policies such as proposed labor reforms that would reduce the already unsustainable minimum income and privatize the pension system a civic strike is a form of protest in a country where most of the population does not have formal employment and therefore cannot engage in collective action at the workplace everyone comes out to the streets to protest in any way they can workers go on strike students do not attend classes people in marginalized communities block the roads etc the comité nacional de paro national committee for the civic strike an umbrella organization of indigenous agrarian civic and labor organizations made the call in october to protest corruption the cost of living and the revenue reform with broad public support they called for the defense of the right to social protest an end to repression and militarization and action against unemployment which borders on 11 percent without accounting for sub

elevator pitch hong kong listed samsonite international s a otcpk smsof otcpk smsey is the world s largest travel luggage manufacturer distributor and retailer with a range of travel products sold globally under various brands like samsonite tumi american tourister speck high sierra gregory lipault kamiliant hartmann and ebags recent financial results in 3q2019 have been negatively impacted by weakness in the u s and hong kong while u s tariffs on china sourced products have hurt its profitability which is partially offset by the company s cost saving initiatives in fy2020 samsonite international s profitability should see a slight improvement due to increased sourcing of u s products outside of china and continued store rationalization in the medium to long term acquisitions and e commerce are key growth drivers for the company samsonite international trades at 13 4 times consensus forward fy2020 p e which represents a discount to the stock s historical five year average forward p e of approximately 19 times samsonite also offers a consensus forward fy2020 dividend yield of 3 9 this is an update of my initiation article on the company published on september 6 2019 samsonite international s share price has increased by approximately 15 from hk 14 82 as of september 4 2019 to hk 17 12 as of november 27 2019 i retain my neutral rating on the stock as samsonite international is a consumer cyclical whose product demand is correlated with global travel demand and economic growth given uncertainties associated with the global economy and u s china trade tensions i don t find the stock s valuation sufficiently attractive to compensate for such risks even at current levels i e forward p e at a discount to historical average readers are advised to trade in samsonite s shares listed on the hong kong stock exchange with the ticker 1910 hk where average daily trading value for the past three months exceeds 9 million and market capitalization is above 3 billion investors can invest in key asian stock markets either using u s brokers with international coverage such as interactive brokers ibkr fidelity charles schwab schw or local brokers operating in their respective domestic markets weakness in u s and hong kong responsible for yoy revenue decline in 3q2019 samsonite international s 3q2019 net sales were down 2 5 yoy in u s dollar terms or 0 7 yoy on a constant currency basis at 921 5 million the company s weak performance in the u s and hong kong were key factors for its yoy revenue decline the u s revenue decreased 7 5 and 6 2 yoy in 3q2019 and 9m2019 respectively due to three key reasons firstly samsonite international s stores in u s gateway cities such as new york florida and california suffered from a decline in foreign tourists particularly visitors from china the strong u s dollar relative to the chinese yuan and u s china trade tensions are likely why chinese tourists have been more reluctant to visit the u s the same store sales growth for the company s stores in u s gateway cities was 12 8 yoy in 9m2019 due to a significant reduction in inbound traffic secondly samsonite international s u s wholesale revenue including online retailers like amazon amzn and department stores was down 7 3 yoy year to date as of end september 2019 largely due to a 10 tariff imposed on china sourced luggage products sold in the u s in september 2018 and a further 15 tariff implemented in june 2019 wholesale clients have become more cautious on the outlook for u s domestic consumption and they have reduced their purchasing budgets for future orders thirdly ebags a leading online retailer of bags and other travel accessories acquired by samsonite international in 2017 was a drag on the company s u s sales samsonite international s 9m2019 u s sales were down 6 2 yoy if ebags were excluded its u s sales would have declined by a lower 4 0 yoy this was due to samsonite international s actions to reduce the sales of lower margin third party brands on its ebags e commerce website to improve profitability similar to many online retailers ebags had been mainly focused on revenue growth by adding products and brands to its platform in an indiscriminate manner at the expense of profitability prior to samsonite international s acquisition ebags remains loss making and the company is taking actions to completely realign ebags product and brand mix with an aim of making ebags profitable by fy2020 hong kong was samsonite international s weakest market in 3q2019 as sales from the market declined 39 2 yoy constant currency basis to 13 6 million the ongoing social unrest in hong kong has resulted in a sharp decline in tourist arrivals which in turn led to low retail traffic and reduced store opening hours overnight visitor arrivals to hong kong fell by 5 3 45 9 and 41 6 yoy in july august and september 2019 respectively more importantly the weakness in hong kong could have a more significant impact on samsonite international s operating profit versus the company s top line because hong kong is largely a direct to consumer market with revenue primarily driven by samsonite and tumi stores located physically in the market a higher fixed cost structure in hong kong implies that samsonite international s hong kong business suffers from the negative effects of operating leverage which magnifies the impact of a decline in revenue on operating profit other markets that were detractors for samsonite international in 3q2019 included south korea and chile whose respective sales were down 14 1 and 3 1 yoy on a constant currency basis to 45 2 million and 10 8 million primarily due to weak domestic consumer sentiment excluding the four markets u s hong kong south korea and chile samsonite international s 3q2019 revenue on a constant currency basis would have been up 7 2 yoy increasing sourcing outside china to mitigate negative impact of tariffs on gross margin samsonite international s gross margin declined by 171 basis points from 57 4 in 3q2018 to 55 7 in 3q2019 primarily due to a cumulative 25 10 with effect from september 2018 and a further 15 with effect from june 2019 tariff imposed on china sourced luggage products sold in the u s in response samsonite international had raised u s wholesale prices by 12 which was insufficient to offset the impact of the tariffs the company has no plans for further price increases at the moment as it monitors consumer feedback to increased product prices during the holiday shopping season towards the end of the year the company is responding to gross margin pressure from u s tariffs on chinese products by shifting the sourcing of u s products from china to other asian countries in 3q2018 samsonite international sourced 82 3 of its u s products from china the proportion of china sourced u s products had declined to 67 6 in 3q2019 ahead of its original 75 target by end 2019 samsonite s positive progress with respect to accelerated product sourcing outside of china was achieved in multiple ways the company worked with existing suppliers in expanding capacity outside china and also engaged new suppliers in india and southeast asia samsonite also leveraged on its global scale and shifted some of the non chinese production capacity originally meant for europe and asia to the u s looking ahead samsonite international is targeting to further reduce the proportion of china sourced u s products to 50 55 by end of fy2020 which should see the company s overall gross margin showing a yoy improvement starting from 2q2020 1q2020 is not a good comparison as the second round of tariffs came into effect in 2q2019 the company is not likely to decrease the proportion of china sourced u s products below 50 unless u s china trade relationships further deteriorate this is because china is still a cheaper excluding impact of tariffs sourcing destination vis a vis southeast asia and india as existing chinese factories are supported by a well established supply chain of raw material and component suppliers and benefit from higher labor productivity at the time of writing it was reported that u s and china are coming close to a phase one trade deal however given u s china trade talks having been ongoing for more than a year i won t pin too much hopes on a successful trade deal more importantly existing tariffs might not be lifted as part of the trade deal in other words samsonite international s gross margin improvement will be heavily dependent on the company successfully shifting more of its u s product sourcing outside of china cost saving initiatives helped to narrow ebitda margin decline as highlighted earlier samsonite international s gross margin declined by 171 basis points yoy to 55 7 in 3q2019 but the company s ebitda margin adjusted for implementation of new international financial reporting standard ifrs 16 to be comparable decreased by a lower 130 basis points to 14 5 for 3q2019 furthermore samsonite international s yoy ebitda margin decline of 130 basis points was narrower than ebitda margin compression of 300 basis points and 150 basis points yoy in 1q2019 and 2q2019 respectively this is because samsonite international s cost saving initiatives such as store rationalization and reduction in advertising and spending have worked samsonite international has shut down six stores in 9m2019 with an additional four stores expected to be closed in 4q2019 and 1q2020 the company is also actively exploring rent reductions with landlords in various markets the ease of store rationalization and rent reduction negotiations varies from market to market at the extreme u s is the most difficult market for samsonite international to rationalize stores and achieve rent reductions because lease terms in the u s can be as long as 10 years but samsonite international continues to negotiate with landlords on rental concessions or early termination for certain underperforming stores on the other hand the hong kong market benefits from shorter average lease terms of three years the norm which implies that roughly one third of the leases for its hong kong stores are renewed every year the company is the most active in exploring store rationalization and rent reduction negotiations in europe because this is the market where the company has been most aggressively expanding its store footprint in the past which implies a relatively higher proportion of underperforming stores compared to other markets samsonite international s advertising spend as a percentage of revenue has been reduced from 6 1 in 9m2018 to 5 5 in 9m2019 on a constant currency basis advertising spend was cut by 16 8 million over this period the company is targeting a 5 7 5 8 advertising spend as a percentage of revenue for fy2020 which will be closer to its normalized 6 advertising spend ratio historically as it seeks to allocate some of the cost savings derived from

samsonite international samsonite has historically been a serial acquirer with m a being a key contributor to its top line growth past acquisitions included high sierra and hartmann in 2012 gregory lipault and speck in 2014 chic accent and rolling luggage in 2015 tumi in 2016 and ebags in 2017 the company has put a temporary hold on new acquisitions as it focuses on improving profitability and balance sheet strength but it continues to be on the lookout for new acquisition opportunities samsonite international highlighted at its recent 3q2019 results briefing that this business has further m a opportunities so acquisitions in the medium to long term could help to accelerate its revenue growth the company s e commerce revenues are growing approximately 20 every year and e commerce sales accounted for 15 4 of its 9m2019 revenue going forward e commerce s revenue contribution should continue to grow every year given that samsonite international s overall direct to consumer business including both brick and mortar and e commerce has a higher profit margin than its wholesale business the company could potentially expand its profit margins over time with a larger revenue contribution from e commerce if it manages digital advertising spend ebags has a higher advertising spend to revenue ratio of 10 compared with 5 6 for the overall company and intense competition in

in an interview with jamaran iranian economist saeed laylaz described the recent hike in the fuel price in iran as a pricing reform but also leveled heavy criticism at the management strategies of the government the following is the text of his interview q mr laylaz you had already announced that you were one of the architects of the fuel consumption management plan laylaz that s right i was a strong supporter of an increase in the price of energy carriers not gasoline alone but the plan that i had put forward in early 1397 march 2018 at the outset of new sanctions had three parts the first part entailed reform policies including a rise in the price of energy carriers the second part involved policies to offer support and compensation in the face of such price reform to double or triple the subsidies and to guarantee a daily supply of 2 000 calories with the distribution of coupons among all 83 million people in iran thirdly under no circumstance should a patient be deprived of medicine or treatment we must also make the public transportation almost free and guarantee free education up to the degree of diploma the principle of my theory in theoretical or ideological terms is that i believe that no revolution or unrest would take place without three or four deciles of a society those three deciles include the lowest income population also without the three or four middle deciles there would be no stability and without the one or two top deciles no progress would be made after all let s see which issues in iran do not have domestic roots for instance we face an environmental crisis do iraq afghanistan pakistan saudi arabia and turkey not face it we have a gap between the rich and the poor do not the other regional countries have it all are the same if i m not mistaken the volume of liquidity in iran stood at 200 billion tomans at the time of the 1979 revolution it now stands at above 2 200 trillion tomans it s incredible how high it is it has risen by around 10 000 times within 40 years this would create inflation inflation is the root cause of all problems on the other hand we were plagued by organized corruption in iran over the past 15 years i believe that all of our problems have internal roots trump or friendship with or hostility towards the united states would not determine iran s issues and problems hard work in countries like malaysia south korea china and japan has nothing to do with friendship with or hostility against the us what does it have to do with the united states if the input of resources in iran is 100 and the output is 40 we must combat domestic corruption and the genuine combat is as follows tackling corruption should not be confined to a specific party the advertisement should be proportional to combatting corruption you must eliminate the grounds for corruption which means economic liberalization wherever there is economic rent and privilege there would be embezzlement the basic principle of combatting corruption is democracy why are the reformists generally healthier than non reformists in financial issues why was seyyed mohammad khatami s administration the best healthiest and the most well functioning administration in the history of iran after the revolution because that administration was the target of the heaviest propaganda and political criticism and the tiniest case of corruption in it was being exaggerated ten times stronger do you believe that mr trump has determined such four dimension situation please specify the role of the united states in such state of corruption you can mention a hundred other basic issues of iran and i ll prove that the sanctions have had not the merest impact on those matters we have overcome and bypassed most of the harmful effects of the sanctions and are doing our job the issue of sanctions is not a long term issue the supreme leader himself has announced that sanctions would last for two or three years i suppose that we may get somewhere within the next six or seven months because americans have also many restrictions in this approach however we just wrangled with each other inside the country during the two or three years when we were not slapped with sanctions are sanctions to blame everybody could have been given the opportunity to work and have imported technologies iran will grow beyond the size of a regional power if it gets out of this crisis iran s current problem is the crisis of incompetence it will be fixed if someone makes that competent an era will come that iran s economic growth would become a two digit number this however would not happen overnight a scientific process is underway in historical terms a napoleon bonaparte will emerge in iran and will carry out the process of transition to a pragmatic government whose pillars are based on iranian nationalism but would be muslim this would happen in the form of a transformation not a revolution i considered the very same developments in the past recent decade as a step in this path but what is the objective meaning of such deficient scheme passed by mr rouhani i invite my principlist friends to exercise such reasoning we would get 30 000 billion tomans from the top social classes of iran every year and inject it into the poorest classes of the society this would increase the gini coefficient in iran overnight so why shouldn t we do that didn t we experience a reform of fuel price during mr khatami s term didn t we have fuel price reform at the beginning of mr rouhani s administration didn t it take place to the highest degree during martyr rajaee s administration from who or where did it meet opposition i do not see gasoline as the primary and final purpose behind the protests by any means when the reforms that should have been implemented step by step are not carried out they turn into a painful surgery every reform is painful the more it is delayed the worse it would become everywhere in the world either in the poor or rich countries where there is no oil the government revenues for running the society are based upon the taxation of alcoholic beverages tobacco and fuel all governments in the world levy very high taxes on these three items to generate revenue we are not allowed to have alcoholic beverages for religious reasons although it is said that alcohol consumption in our country is not lower than the other countries the government in iran has deprived itself of such taxation and this has increased the per capita consumption of alcohol in iran that s because premium pure and original alcohol reaches the consumers in iran at a lower cost than europe because they levy tax on liquor there in europe but not in here moreover we are technically unable to levy a tax on tobacco in addition we cannot increase the fuel price for social reasons the price of gasoline in our country should not be lower than such a limit that smuggling gasoline out of the country would be economically feasible in that case those income resources must be spent on the people which is exactly the example of social justice i wonder why the opponents oppose this plan q why doesn t the income of people rise with a hike in the fuel prices because a series of charts have made a comparison between iran and the other countries laylaz such comparisons are so weird according to the scheme introduced by mr rouhani a four member family for instance would receive at least 200 000 tomans in cash handout well such sum of money is equivalent to the difference in the cost of 100 liters of gasoline with new prices another 60 liters is also received under the rationing system making a total of 160 liters per month accordingly the families would by no means be affected by the rise in the gasoline price the administration has given every family the freedom of choice with such scheme the true winners in this scheme would be the seven lowest deciles of the society because it is totally clear that we get 30 000 billion tomans from the main consumers of gasoline in the country and give it to the poorest social classes q don t you think that the administration would enlarge liquidity with this plan laylaz the rise of liquidity has nothing to do with this issue under such scheme the administration gets money from one person and gives it to another individual since the scheme has not created any new liquidity in the society it would not lead to inflation either
imagine that you could travel back in time to 1975 snatch a random new yorker off the street and set him loose in the city today the new york he knew was a place in steep economic decline people jobs and industry were fleeing to the suburbs grimy dangerous and violent new york teetered on the brink of bankruptcy what would that same new yorker make of the city today he wouldn t have any trouble finding his way around the bronx would still be up the battery down and lady liberty would continue to preside over the harbor most of the city s great landmarks the empire state and chrysler buildings rockefeller and lincoln centers would look much as they did the streets would still be clogged with traffic he could take the same subways across manhattan and out to the edges of brooklyn queens and the bronx the path train to new jersey and new jersey transit and metro north into the outer suburbs
richmond va in mid 2016 even with unemployment falling and the economy growing modestly james bullard head of the st louis federal reserve bank was concerned months earlier with bullard s support the fed had raised rates for the first time in seven years panicky financial markets responded by sending stocks tumbling the fed delayed plans for further rate hikes through it all there was still no sign of higher inflation the supposed bogeyman that had led the fed to raise rates in the first place we were expecting inflation to pick up bullard acknowledged in an interview this month we had the idea that we should be pre emptive and prevent that from happening but a lot of those predictions didn t come true so that made me think that we didn t have the right framework bullard decided to develop a new framework which he announced in june 2016 it was based on a notion that bullard was among the first fed officials to fully recognize that the u s economy was stuck in a rut with low growth and low worker productivity and wouldn t likely spark high inflation even if unemployment kept falling it s a notion that members of the fed s rate setting committee including chairman jerome powell have come to collectively embrace it helps explain why powell has made clear as recently as this week that he sees no need to raise rates anytime soon despite an unemployment rate near a 50 year low bullard s framework flew in the face of a long standing belief among economists that as unemployment falls steadily employers will keep raising wages and high inflation will follow casting aside such traditional economic models bullard felt that the economy could keep growing and employers could keep hiring without igniting inflation he argued that the fed would probably need to raise rates only once more to a range of just 0 5 percent to 0 75 percent advertisement that view highly unusual three years ago transformed bullard from a centrist member of the fed s policymaking committee to one of the more dovish doves typically worry less about inflation and more about sustaining growth and employment hawks generally favor higher rates to control inflation most fed policymakers at that time worried that the unemployment rate 5 percent in december 2015 was low enough that it would likely accelerate wages and inflation they wanted to lift the fed s benchmark short term rate closer to its historical norms after seven years of holding it at zero the consensus then was that a rate as high as 3 5 percent would still be neutral that is it would neither support nor restrain growth and yet since late last year the fed has shifted much closer to bullard s position powell has engineered three rate cuts since july to a range of just 1 5 percent to 1 75 percent these cuts followed four rate hikes last year to a large extent the u turn reflected worries among fed policymakers that president trump s trade war with china was weakening the economy and that this threat would worsen over time the rate cuts were intended to offset that drag but powell has also indicated that the policy switch occurred in part because the fed has abandoned or revamped models that correlated low unemployment with high inflation most economists agree that this correlation has largely disappeared at least for now online retail and price conscious consumers have made it harder for many companies to charge more and with labor unions a diminished force workers can t push for higher pay so easily there was a tight connection between unemployment and inflation powell told congress this month that is no longer the case and really hasn t been the case for some time advertisement key fed officials have also suggested that the neutral rate which the fed thought was as high as 3 percent late last year could be as low as 1 percent that s what bullard was saying way before said kathy bostjancic an economist at oxford economics he was kind of a thought leader on the fed many economists foresee another rate cut in 2020 if so that would mean borrowing costs like mortgage rates would likely stay low for months or even years this would help support consumer and business spending as well as the economy it would also mean though that savers would earn little return on their bank accounts and other fixed income investments we just don t live in an inflationary world anymore said j w mason an economist and fellow at the roosevelt institute rather the economy is more likely to face chronic ongoing weak demand from consumers mason said that s why the last three

of the great recession after serving as an economist at the st louis fed since 1990 he is the third longest serving of the 12 regional bank presidents behind charles evans of the chicago fed and eric rosengren of the boston fed back in 2012 bullard had embraced a hawkish position and opposed chairman ben bernanke s decision to launch a third round of fed treasury purchases to try to lower longer term rates and spur growth bullard said he wanted to wait until the direction of the economy became clearer yet the next year he opposed bernanke s timing for winding down those purchases citing a more dovish concern about still low inflation one economic consulting firm cited bullard as one of the most market moving fed officials typically second only to the chairman because he was seen as a bellwether on the committee i try not to be dogmatic bullard said in the interview unlike all 16 other fed policymakers bullard doesn t forecast a long term target for the fed s benchmark rate he thinks it s too hard to predict the economy that far ahead advertisement since 2016 with his new framework in hand bullard has stuck mostly to a dovish stance he warned in 2017 that continued fed hikes could cause short term rates to exceed long term rates an odd phenomenon known as a yield curve inversion and usually a precursor of a recession the yield curve did invert in march this year though it reversed last month last year bullard wasn t a voting member of the fed s rate setting committee when it raised rates four times but he said he accepted the first three and argued only against the fourth in december that hike along with signals that the fed would raise rates twice more in 2020 and continue reducing its treasury bond holdings sent the markets into a tailspin the fed has seen more inflation out there in the future than the market has basically over the last 10 years bullard said we kept predicting that inflation was just around the corner and therefore we have to get rates higher that has turned out to be wrong and markets had it right some other fed officials have been pushing in the same direction including neel kashkari of the minneapolis fed who is

popular discontent is fueling protest and paralysis across latin america if east asia isn t careful it could be next in ecuador protests against anti austerity measures including the reduction of fuel subsidies forced president lenín moreno to declare a state of emergency in chile it was a modest increase in santiago s metro fares that triggered large scale demonstrations which soon evolved to take aim at inequality and weaknesses in the education and pension systems in argentina the people expressed their economic frustrations at the ballot box electing the peronist presidential candidate alberto fernández in bolivia the electoral route was compromised president evo morales violated the constitution by standing for a fourth term declared victory despite widespread concerns about fraud and then resigned after weeks of protests while the details vary there is a common thread in all of these movements the belief that governments are not working for ordinary people as daron acemoglu and james a robinson have observed the extractive institutions on which many latin american economies depend protect the interests of the rich and elites across the region inequality has been skyrocketing and there is little reason to expect political power structures favoring those same privileged people to address it after years of economic stagnation and even crisis the public s patience has worn thin to be sure many latin american leaders have in recent decades risen to power on the promise of leveling the playing field and their interventions including income redistribution fiscal and monetary expansion protectionism discriminatory regulation and capital controls did bring some short term benefits particularly to the poor but such measures were often plagued by populism and ultimately did more harm than good relying on commodity revenues to fund their social programs these leaders failed to diversify their economies or improve economic fundamentals excessive fiscal and monetary expansion made these economies unstable current account deficits grew resulting in frequent foreign exchange crises the combination of social polarization inadequate institutions and weak economic fundamentals has made it difficult for even reform minded governments to escape the trap of short termism and lay the groundwork for long term development in this context neoliberal reforms such as the rapid economic opening and financial liberalization promoted by the international monetary fund made economies even more vulnerable to external shocks venezuela is a case in point from 1999 to 2013 the populist hugo chávez used the country s oil revenues bolstered by rising global commodity prices to finance large scale welfare programs rather than investment in new industries his handpicked successor nicolás maduro attempted to follow in his footsteps but when global oil prices plummeted in 2014 the fiscal deficit soared the subsequent monetary expansion fueled hyperinflation making it impossible for millions of venezuelans to afford basic goods such as food and medicine venezuela is now mired in a humanitarian crisis that has already driven more than four million people to flee the country a similar story has unfolded in argentina where it was the peronist president cristina fernández de kirchner who upon taking office in 2007 used commodity revenues to expand welfare spending and public sector employment thereby increasing the economy s vulnerability to external shocks when mauricio macri took over in 2015 the economy was in dire straits with limited access to international capital markets yet voters resisted the needed reforms owing to their short term costs macri failed to overcome that resistance and it is far from clear that fernández whose vice president is none other than kirchner will do any better east asian economies avoided many of these mistakes over the last half century implementing carefully designed economic development plans that fostered export competitiveness and technological progress throughout this process strong and inclusive institutions ensured the effective functioning of markets supported sound macroeconomic management and upheld the rule of law as a result east asian economies achieved growth with equity which lifted them from middle to high income status in 1970 per capita incomes in hong kong singapore south korea and taiwan were lower than those in argentina and venezuela today they are much higher but east asia must not underestimate its potential for political crisis in recent decades the region s long term growth potential has declined and income distribution has worsened trends that populations blame at least partly on their political leaders not surprisingly populism is on the rise in south korea president moon jae in s administration has pursued policies that include sharp increases in the minimum wage and social welfare spending as latin america s experience has starkly demonstrated while fiscal transfers may help to bolster a sluggish economy and strengthen the social safety net a rapid increase in unproductive spending could weaken economic fundamentals in the longer term the situation in hong kong which has been roiled by nearly six months of increasingly violent protests is somewhat different there the target of protesters ire is china s central government which they argue is violating the one country two systems framework that defines the city s relationship with the mainland but key sources of popular frustration such as soaring property prices which exacerbate inequality are familiar to avoid latin america style political crises east asian governments must ensure that their economic policies support equitable growth their priorities should include boosting productivity strengthening export competitiveness encouraging technological progress nurturing domestic demand and service industries building robust social safety nets and implementing redistributive tax and transfer policies fiscal sustainability is also crucial while economic stagnation demands fiscal expansion governments must spend wisely that means investing in long term growth potential by say deepening human capital and strengthening social infrastructure rather than committing to unsustainable hikes in welfare spending finally east asia must make sure that it holds its political leaders accountable to that end countries should continue to fortify their institutions including an independent judiciary protect free and independent media and nurture a vibrant civil society east asia has a long tradition of forward thinking policymaking at a time of growing economic political and social challenges upholding that tradition has never been more

continue or view more offers article content alberta is worse off today than it was 30 years ago despite the considerable efforts of such exceptional leaders as peter lougheed preston manning ralph klein and others alberta is more vulnerable to destructive federal policies than we were in the 1980s here s the balance sheet article content lougheed s greatest achievement was the addition of section 92a to the 1982 constitution act section 92a affirms and protects all provinces rights to develop their own natural resources for alberta this meant primarily oil and gas and was intended to prevent a repeat of pierre trudeau s national energy program but today his son s carbon tax and bill c 69 the no pipelines ever law are nep 2 0 they make section 92a almost meaningless this stranding of alberta s oil is aggravated by the liberals tanker ban off the north coast of b c bill c 48 of course there is no similar ban on oil tankers in the st lawrence river bringing opec oil to refineries in quebec lougheed also was familiar with the centralist bias of the supreme court of canada he understood that the adoption of the 1982 charter of rights amplified this risk as a precaution lougheed insisted on the addition of the section 33 notwithstanding power to protect alberta and other provinces from policy vetoes by judges appointed unilaterally by the prime minister today the notwithstanding power is in disrepute and disuse noon news roundup your weekday lunchtime roundup of curated links news highlights analysis and features there was an error please provide a valid email

has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content lougheed was also the strongest advocate for the new constitutional amending formula that treated all provinces equally and gave no special veto to quebec this was a major victory for all the western provinces in 1996 liberal prime minister jean chretien gave the veto power back to quebec via ordinary legislation a final lougheed achievement was his insistence on limiting the scope of section 35 to existing aboriginal rights he successfully demanded the insertion of existing to prevent it from becoming a blank cheque for judicial policy making the supreme court subsequently ignored the framers intent and invented the duty to consult words found nowhere in the constitution the result is that canadian pipeline policy is now made mainly by unelected unaccountable judges alberta s economic collapse has been exacerbated by ottawa s abdication of federal responsibility for interprovincial pipelines in the 1980s it was unthinkable that a province could block the construction of an interprovincial pipeline that had been approved by the federal government now it s happened twice energy east by quebec and trans mountain by british columbia nothing falls more clearly under federal jurisdiction but in this fall s election campaign justin trudeau pandered to quebec voters with the promise that he would fight premiers kenney and ford and the energy companies that support them advertisement 4 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content equalization and other federal transfer programs continue to drain billions of dollars a year out of alberta over 300 billion since 2000 meanwhile quebec continues to see its share of equalization dollars increase from less than 3 billion a year in the early 1980s to over 13 billion a year today or 66 cents of every dollar ottawa sends out while shocking these numbers are not that surprising the liberal party can and does form majority governments without electing any mps from alberta or saskatchewan but winning a big chunk of quebec s 78 mps is key to the liberals strategy to build a majority government indeed in 2015 trudeau was the first liberal leader to win a majority of quebec s seats since his father did it in 1980 that hasn t changed what has changed is the federal civil service that administers all these programs when pierre trudeau introduced bilingualism it was sold as only a language proficiency test but in practice it has meant that a disproportionate number of federal bureaucrats especially in the upper levels are quebec francophones the result administrative decisions in ottawa are made through an ideological lens that is sympathetic to quebec s concerns and interests advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content in the 1980s preston manning helped to form the new reform party under the banner the west wants in during the 1990s manning and the reformers did well they swept the mulroney conservatives off the electoral map in 1993 and in 1997 formed the official opposition in parliament fiscal reform balanced budgets and triple e senate reform all seemed within reach today federal deficits and debt are at record levels the project of an elected senate is dead killed by an arbitrary 2014 supreme court ruling and a new liberal government that was only too happy to let it die in the early 2000s foreign capital investment poured into alberta conocophillips marathon apache and chevron all made major new investments but it wasn t just american energy companies new investors included shell bp and centrica from the u k total from france statoil now equinor from norway and a host of smaller companies from south korea china and japan today they are almost all gone since 2015 there has been a 50 billion exodus of foreign capital add the equity sell off of canadian oil and gas companies and the loss soars past 100 billion as noted this collapse has been driven by policy not oil prices where alberta used to rank near the top in terms of energy sector competitiveness we now rank 16th in a recent survey of 20 north american states and provinces the problem regulatory uncertainty lack of pipeline access and taxes advertisement 6 story continues below

from its new name tc energy and is re allocating its investments to texas and mexico encana which began as alberta energy corp and grew to the highest valued canadian owned energy company in the world has changed its name to ovintiv and slinked away to denver the bottom line is clear the political strategies of my generation of albertans have not worked to improve alberta s position within confederation it would be a disservice to our children s generation to say otherwise today we are even more vulnerable to the liberals tried and true strategy of pillaging alberta s economy to buy

by graham peebles what is yours is mine what is mine is my own graham peebles highlights the injustices and hardships caused to ordinary ethiopians by their government s policy of giving away agricultural land to foreign cash crop investors and land speculators it is a colonial phenomenon appropriate land for the needs of the colonists and to hell with the indigenous people might is right be it military or economic the power of the dollar rules supreme in a world built upon the acquisition of the material the perpetuation of desire and the entrapment of the human spirit africa has for long been the object of western domination control and usury this was so under the british the french and the portuguese of old now the new rulers of the world large corporations from america china japan the middle east india and europe are engaged in extensive land acquisitions in the developing countries the vast majority of available land is in sub saharan africa where according to a report by the united nations permanent forum on indigenous issues 80 per cent that is potentially available for expanded rain fed crop production is thought to be huge industrial agricultural centres are being created producing crops for the investors home market meanwhile indigenous people subsistence farmers and pastoralists are forced off the land the natural environment is levelled the land is purged of wildlife and small rural communities that have lived worked and cared for the land for centuries are destroyed the numbers of people potentially affected by the land grab and its impact on the environment is staggering the un report states by 2020 135 million people may be driven from their land as a result of soil degradation with 60 million in sub saharan africa alone this contemporary land grab has come about as a result of food shortages the financial meltdown in 2008 and in light of the united nations world population forecast of 9 2 billion people by 2050 it is also the result of three main consequent pressures 1 food insecurity especially in the middle east and on the asian continent 2 growing worldwide demand for agro fuels and 3 the rise in investment in land and soft commodities such as coffee cocoa sugar corn wheat soya and fruit often investors are simply speculators seeking to make a fast or indeed slow buck by land banking sitting on the asset waiting and watching for the price to inflate then selling according to a report by the oakland institute along with hedge funds and speculators some public universities and pension funds are among those in on the land rush eyeing returns of 20 to as much as 40 per cent land not as home but as a chip to be thrown upon the international gambling table of commercialization ethiopia for sale everything has a price this applies even to the people and land of a country sold into destitution by governments motivated by distorted notions of development at bargain basement prices and with 99 year leases in some cases the land is literally given away as the oakland institute report states in mali one investment group was able to secure one million hectares of fertile land for a 50 year term for free elsewhere two dollars per hectare roughly equal to two olympic size athletic grounds is the going rate according to a report in the guardian newspaper the lowest prices are in africa where says the world bank at least 35 million hectares of land has been bought or leased other groups including friends of the earth say the figure is higher the ethiopian government through the agricultural investment support directorate is at the forefront of this african land sale crops common to the area such as maize sesame and sorghum as well as wheat and rice are grown for export to saudi arabia india and china rather than for the benefit of ethiopians the oakland institute research shows that at least 3 619 509 hectares of land an area just smaller than belgium have been transferred to investors although the actual number may be higher the government claims that the land available for lease is unused and surplus to requirement but this is disingenuous nonsense large areas of land are in fact already cultivated by smallholder subsistence farmers and pastoralists using land for grazing all of which are unceremoniously evicted villages are destroyed and indigenous people expelled from their homeland and forced into large scale village programmes level growing field along with the land grab goes the appropriation of water sources investors are allowed to do what they will with the land they lease including diverting rivers digging canals from existing water sources building dams and drilling bore holes the oakland institute report quotes the saudi star company as saying that water will be biggest issue and numerous plans are being established including the construction of 30 kilometres of cement lined canals and another dam on the alwero river in gambella where unbelievably a third of the region is available for foreign take up the government in 2011 offered more than 2 500 square kilometres 1 000 sq miles of virgin fertile land to bangalore based food company karuturi global to lease for 50 years for the equivalent of 1 16 us dollars per hectare compared to the average price of 340 dollars per hectare in the punjab district of india it is no wonder that the chief executive of karuturi described the incentives available to the floriculture industry in ethiopia as mouthwatering including low air freight rates on the state owned ethiopian airlines tax holidays and no customs duties up to 60 000 workers will be employed by karuturi which is paying local people less than one dollar a day well below what the world bank regards as extreme poverty unstable supply of staples around five million people in ethiopia rely on food aid and live with constant food insecurity that will only increase under the land grab bonanza according to the oakland institute s report commercial investment will increase rates of food insecurity in the vicinity of the land investments this will be compounded by the transfer of vast areas of land used for the cultivation of traditional staples such as teff to other crops a matter that is responsible for the price of teff quadrupling in the last four years according to a friends of the earth international report the result has often been people forced off land they have traditionally farmed for generations more rural poverty and greater risk of food shortages food security will be realized when local smallholders are encouraged to farm their land and given financial support machinery and the necessary technology as the charity oxfam reports small scale producers particularly women can indeed play a crucial role in poverty reduction and food security but to do so they need investment in infrastructure markets processing storage extension and research in other words keep development small for of and close to the people in need and see them flourish land rights human cost environmental damage the land rights of the indigenous people of ethiopia are somewhat ambiguous as a legacy of the socialist dictatorship of the 1970s and 1980s the government technically owns all land however there is protection in law for indigenous people article 40 3 of the ethiopian constitution states land is a common property of the nations nationalities and peoples of ethiopia and shall not be subject to sale or to other means of exchange paragraph 4 of the same article of the constitution says that ethiopian peasants have the right to obtain land without payment and the protection against eviction from their possession in regard to pastoralists affected by the land sell off paragraph 5 says that ethiopian pastoralists have the right to free land for grazing and cultivation as well as the right not to be displaced from their own lands the un declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples which ethiopia signed in 2007 states article 26 1 indigenous peoples have the right to the lands territories and resources which they have traditionally owned occupied or otherwise used or acquired paragraph 2 states indigenous peoples have the right to own use develop and control the lands territories and resources that they possess by reason of traditional ownership or other traditional occupation or use as well as those which they have otherwise acquired the declaration also outlines compensation measures for landowners article 28 1 states indigenous peoples have the right to redress by means that can include restitution or when this is not possible just fair and equitable compensation for the lands territories and resources which they have traditionally owned or otherwise occupied or used and which have been confiscated taken occupied used or damaged without their free prior and informed consent paragraph 2 of the same article says unless otherwise freely agreed upon by the peoples concerned compensation shall take the form of lands territories and resources equal in quality size and legal status or of monetary compensation or other appropriate redress the law it would appear is clear but what is needed is for the international community in particular the donor countries to demand that the ruling ethiopian people s democratic revolutionary front eprdf implement and respect it land and people the ethiopian people are not being consulted or democratically included in the decisions to transform their homeland this contravenes the ethiopian constitution which states article 92 3 people have the right to full consultation and to the expression of views in the planning and implementations of environmental policies and projects that affect them directly these are hollow words to those being evicted from their land like omot ochan a villager from the anuak tribe whose family has lived in the forest near the baro river in gambella for 10 generations speaking to the guardian he insisted that the saudi star company had no right to be in his forest the company had not even told the villagers that it was going to dig a canal across their land nobody came to tell us what was happening he said adding this land belonged to our father all round here is ours for two days walk well that was the case until the government leased some 10 000 hectares to the ethiopian born saudi oil millionaire sheikh al amoudi to grow rice for his saudi star company omot continued two years ago the company began chopping down the forest and the bees went away the bees need thick forest we used to sell honey we used to hunt with dogs too but after the farm came the animals here disappeared now we only have fish to sell with the company draining the wetlands the fish will probably be gone soon too sheikh al amoudi plans to export over a million tonnes of rice a year to saudi arabia to ease relations with the regime of meles zenawi and as the guardian states to smooth the wheels of commerce al amoudi has recruited one of meles s former ministers haile assegdie as chief executive of saudi star traditional land rights for people who have lived on the land in gamabella and elsewhere for centuries are being ignored and in a country where all manner of human rights are routinely violated legally binding compensations are not being paid government drafted lease agreements with investors state that the meles regime will hand over the land free of any encumbrances i e people and property in fact anyone living or using the land to graze their livestock or pastoralists according to the independent newspaper ethiopia is forcing tens of thousands of people off their land so it can lease it to foreign investors leaving former landowners destitute and in some cases starving this it would appear is seen as a price worth paying by the ethiopian government and those multinationals appropriating the land

crude oil saw little price change until friday opening at 57 83 on monday trading up to 58 72 on wednesday and opening at 58 24 on friday but news reports of indications that opec members and allied

restraining volatility the overall range was 1 3234 to 1 3318 but 26 points of that was a brief thursday descent in the asian market and supporting the dollar canada was the seemingly permanent anticipation of a successful conclusion to the us china trade talks president trump signed two bills passed overwhelmingly by the us congress supporting the hong kong democracy movement i signed these bills out of respect for president xi china and the people of hong kong said trump in a white house statement beijing objected forcefully to the implied criticism but the impact on the trade

restricted trading range of the week there has been little change in the overall technical outlook the macro situation remains a contest between the good and likely improving us and canadian economies and the potentially greater boost for the us from the china trade agreement the 21 day 100 day and 200 day moving averages continue to indicate short term upward momentum in dollar canada strongest in the short end the relative strength index rsi is still above neutral though the sideways movement this week has reduced its overbought position from early in the week the upward channel initiated in late october is intact though the lower border was penetrated by thursday s brief foray lower support and resistance levels for the usd cad have been static for two weeks the main support is at 1 3050 with a band below ending at 1 3018 the low back to october 2018 below that the currency pair encounters another band at 1 2900 1 2880 the extent of a series of lows late in august to mid october 2018 above current levels the first obstacle is the 1 3330 1 3350 strip containing the tops in the second half of the year it is somewhat stronger for having rejected a minor attempted breach two weeks ago between 1 3450 and 1 3475 is a band that was the upper limit for a majority of the sessions from late april to early august though pierced numerous times during that period the closes above that band were limited to the very beginning and the very end of the period and the final collapse on august third marked a substantial downward move the next minor resistance is at 1 3525 the substantive high in may the two and a half year top in december 2018 at 1 3685 was largely a function of december s limited liquidity and would not make for a serious pause likewise the brief high at 1 3800 in june 2017 and the spike to above 1 4600 in january 2016 are both too long ago and too short to provide reference technical support and resistance lines are primarily indicators of gathered historical price

donald trump xi jinping file daniel moss tribune news service for all the fears that the us and china are unwinding the economic ties that drove decades of global prosperity it s striking how much recent optimism depends upon the two countries just months ago all the talk was about recession stocks were tanking and tariffs flew back and forth across the pacific now the s p 500 is reaching record highs global growth outlooks have steadied and pessimism among manufacturers appears to be abating expectations for a worldwide economic recovery soared in november compared with the previous month according to a survey of fund managers by bank of america corp the bulls are back its strategists wrote what changed two things first the world s most important central bank delivered and we re starting to see the results the federal reserve eased more aggressively than anyone dared hope at the dawn of 2019 initially there was some skepticism that chairman jerome powell could pull off what he called a mid cycle adjustment that is cutting rates enough to stave off the worst recession fears but not so much as to stoke asset bubbles yet markets appear satiated and us employment housing retail and consumer sentiment indicators have stabilised all this was done against the backdrop of slow steady easing in china where the central bank started cutting reserve requirements well before the fed moved and trimmed borrowing costs further as the year wore on another factor is the prospect of trade detente between washington and beijing officials say they are discussing a phase one deal that would have both sides making concessions on agriculture intellectual property and technology while few expect a comprehensive pact to cease economic hostilities confidence that some kind of agreement will be reached underpins the mildly positive case for the economy after all few things are as important to global growth as how the world s two biggest economies interact with each other to be sure nobody is talking about a boom prospects for 2020 are looking decent because of reduced negatives rather than increased positives rates were too high and had been lifted too quickly especially considering the fact that inflation hasn t come close to most major central banks 2 target the fed s key gauge of inflation rose a microscopic 1 3 in september and china s factory gate prices are falling which exports lower prices to the rest of the world unlike the synchronised upswing that characterised 2017 a sort of synchronised stability might best describe 2020 the organization for economic cooperation and development last week said global growth is stuck at 2 9 this year and next the expansion will pick up to a hardly inspiring 3 in 2021 recent market ebullience speaks to how desperate investors have become for not utterly terrible news china meanwhile hasn t delivered as much easing as many market participants would like the cut in the benchmark rate that some predicted earlier this year hasn t arrived beijing seems intent on minding its own garden keeping the expansion from slowing too much and watching leverage trade optimists may be ripe for disappointment as well presidents donald trump and xi jinping came close to deal earlier in the year only to see relations sour and tariffs increase china says it s cautiously optimistic but the lack of a deadline and trump s predilection to blow up diplomacy on twitter makes this a dicey bet not to mention the contours of any agreement could shift quickly as the 2020 election draws closer
the angeles cafe is just a small example of the opportunities opening up for australian businesses in south east asia to be both the region s food bowl and the supplier of higher end food and beverage products to an area with a huge and growing population and a rising middle class regional free trade deals with the asean bloc with individual countries including china japan south korea thailand malaysia and singapore the soon to be ratified deal with indonesia and the still to be finalised regional comprehensive economic partnership all help from cakes to big volume beef and lamb exports to beer and malt extracts used for cereal and confectionery australian produce and products are increasingly finding their way into asian markets everyone it seems wants a piece of the pastry economist tim harcourt is in no doubt that we are moving from a mining boom to a dining boom most of it is based on the growing middle class in asean improving living standards and to some extent a reduction in tariffs he says there s beef and the high end of the meat industry cereals and then in tech there are companies that provide technology and training in china india and in asean australia can t feed the region but it can improve capacity harcourt an economist and author based at the university of new south wales disputes the characterisation of australia as china s quarry and japan s beach we actually have 53 000 exporters ten thousand australian companies export goods to china alone a growing population like our produce australian cattle command a premium price in asian markets credit james alcock at the other end of the scale to the carlton cafe is the consolidated pastoral company cpc a 600 million beef cattle behemoth that has 300 000 head of cattle over 3 2 million hectares across western australia the northern territory and queensland cpc is the largest private cattle company in australia and currently in the middle of a management buyout from its majority european owners it also owns two feed lots on indonesia s island of sumatra to which it sends about 60 000 live cattle per year that accounts for about 60 per cent of the company s revenue with the balance coming from boxed beef sold into the north american japanese and south korean markets it s difficult to walk into a supermarket in jakarta or other south east asian capitals and miss the prominent signs advertising australian beef for sale it s a synonym for quality cpc s troy setter has heard the line about a shift from a mining to dining boom for years it s hardly news to the chief executive of a company that has been operating in indonesia for 20 years and he s a little cautious in embracing it we are certainly seeing a couple of things he says first there is a growing population in asia who like our produce and really good produce at that and second average incomes are increasing significantly and once you step up in income you step up in calorie consumption and higher quality calorie consumption we market meat that comes from cpc into indonesia as safe nutritious trustworthy and reliable setter estimates that in an average supermarket in jakarta 15 per cent of the meat comes from cpc jakarta is home to some 10 million people and the greater metropolitan region to about 30 million throughout the region australian beef is sold for everything from 40 burgers and 100 wagyu steaks to leaner more fat free beef used in traditional stir fry cooking setter says the indonesia australia free trade deal which both governments hope to ratify by the of the year will mean cheaper beef for indonesian consumers greater regulatory certainty for his company and confidence to invest in new areas such as horticultural products that s because the tariffs on australian beef and lamb will be slashed to zero or near zero longer term quotas on cattle exports will be locked in and in the horticultural sector tariffs will fall significantly from 25 to 10 per cent on mandarins potatoes and carrots for example though tonnage limits will still apply indonesia s farmers are still so protected by tariffs that a single ordinary australian cauliflower can cost as much as 50 at a higher end supermarket in jakarta we have to export to grow coopers exports more than just beer to south east asia south australia s coopers beer is now a welcome sight in supermarkets and bottle shops in south east asian capitals the company turned over 237 million in sales of all products in 2017 18 and is one of many companies selling into asian markets exports made up just 2 per cent of coopers total beer sales but beer sales are only a small part of the company s export story bulk malt extracts used as an ingredient in cereal and confectionery by major international manufacturers such as kellogg s and mars in countries like thailand is a lower margin higher volume product sold out of australia the third leg is home brew kits coopers sells half its kits to overseas markets and is the largest retailer of such products in the world the company s export manager scott harris says 2 per cent of beer sales is still a lot believe me and that the country s primary markets have been new zealand the united states and the united kingdom but that s starting to change because we have such a large share of domestic markets for bulk extracts and home brew we have to export to grow he says now asia is growing for us china japan korea and parts of mainland europe we are also sold in thailand singapore vietnam and malaysia harris says free trade deals aren t the be all and end all for a company like coopers but they do allow the company to get its products into new markets with less red tape and at a lower price with beer importers they tend to import from all around the world so they might compare coopers with another product from another market with no free trade agreement so they might think they will go with coopers because of the fta but for all the talk of a dining boom and the benefits of regional and bilateral free trade deals it s important to keep things in perspective loading according to the australian bureau of agricultural and resource economics in 2008 09 australia s total merchandise exports which includes all resources and other products were worth 298 billion of which 40 5 billion consisted of agricultural products ten years later total merchandise exports totalled 379 billion while agricultural exports had risen to 50 7 billion in other words the overall contribution of agriculture fisheries and forestry to australia s gdp has declined proportionally relative to mining even as the whole dollar figures have risen
thetriumph of injustice by economists emmanuel saez and gabriel zucman 2019 w w norton documents how governments have systematically allowed the wealthy to dodge taxes and then cut corporate tax rates in the name of closing tax loopholes helping to fuel runaway inequality saez and zucman are world renowned experts in the economics of social inequality in recent years they have turned their attention to documenting the prevalence of tax evasion by the super rich the results of this research are condensed into a 232 page volume the two economists demonstrate that for the first time in modern us history the very rich in 2018 paid a lower percentage of their income in taxes than the average worker and that the us tax system far from being progressive as commonly claimed is regressive the second half of the book consists of policy proposals saez and zucman advocate a form of capitalist reformism similar to that of bernie sanders and elizabeth warren who consulted the two economists in formulating portions of her program we do not share the view of saez and zucman that social inequality can be fought outside of a struggle against the capitalist social order but their presentation of the growth of social inequality in the united states and the role that tax policy has played is vital and should be widely read the book begins with a description of the scale of social inequality in the united states in 1980 the top 1 percent earned a bit more than 10 percent of the nation s income before government taxes and transfers while the bottom 50 percent share was around 20 percent today it s almost the opposite the top 1 percent captures more than 20 percent of national income and the working class barely 12 percent in other words the 1 percent earns almost twice as much income as the entire working class population a group fifty times larger demographically and the increase in the share of the pie going to 2 4 million adults has been similar in magnitude to the loss suffered by more than 100 million americans the book proceeds to describe the incomes of the various sections of american society let s start with the working class the 122 million adults in the lower half of the income pyramid for them the average income is 18 500 before taxes and transfers in 2019 yes you are reading this correctly half of the us adult population lives on an annual income of 18 500 this contrasts sharply with the lives of the affluent upper middle class those in the 90th to 91st percentile with an average income of 220 000 and everything that goes with it spacious suburban houses expensive private schools for their children well funded pensions and good health insurance they are not struggling at the top are the 2 4 million wealthiest people in the united states part of the top 1 percent whose members make 1 5 million in income a year on average saez and zucman argue that this level of social inequality is the outcome of deliberate policy choices on the part of lawmakers they describe how for decades successive administrations have slashed taxes on the wealthy and corporations leading to a massive increase in social inequality they note that confiscatory taxes levied on the very wealthy under the new deal helped rein in the social inequality of the 1920s leading to a more equitable distribution of wealth in the middle of the 20th century from 1930 to 1980 the top marginal income tax rate in the united states averaged 78 percent this top rate reached as much as 91 percent from 1951 to 1963 large bequests were taxed at quasi confiscatory rates during the middle of the twentieth century with rates nearing 80 percent from 1941 to 1976 for the wealthiest americans they continue in 1970 the richest americans paid all taxes included more than 50 percent of their income in taxes twice as much as working class individuals in 2018 following the trump tax reform and for the first time in the last hundred years billionaires have paid less than steel workers schoolteachers and retirees in fact the wealthy have seen their taxes rolled back to levels last seen in the 1910s when the government was only a quarter of the size it is today they argue that more and more the capitalist class is being exempted from taxation the explosive cocktail that is undermining america s system of taxation is simple capital income in varying degrees is becoming tax free such a social order has much in common with the tax collection practices of the french monarchy which are described in detail french kings pampered the affluent and bludgeoned the populace france had an income tax taille whose main claim to fame was that it exempted almost all privileged groups the aristocracy the clergy judges professors doctors the residents of big cities including paris and of course the tax collectors themselves known as the fermiers généraux tax farmers the most destitute members of society at the same time were heavily hit by salt duties the dreaded gabelle and sprawling levies entrées and octrois on the commodities entering the cities including food beverages and building materials the perpetual lowering of taxes on the wealthy has had a symbiotic relationship with the systematic toleration of tax evasion by the rich on the part of the us government which is particularly evident in the effective elimination of the estate tax while estate and gift tax revenues amounted to 0 20 percent of household net wealth in the early 1970s since 2010 they have barely reached 0 03 percent 0 04 percent annually a reduction by a factor of more than five the authors provide further documentation of this collapse in enforcement in 1975 the irs audited 65 percent of the 29 000 largest estate tax returns filed in 1974 by 2018 only 8 6 percent of the 34 000 estate tax returns filed in 2017 were examined the capitulation has been so severe that if we take seriously the wealth reported on estate tax returns nowadays it looks like rich people are either almost nonexistent in america or that they never die saez and zucman document the extent to which us corporations dodge taxes by booking profits in offshore tax havens today close to 60 percent of the large and rising amount of profits made by us multinationals abroad are booked in low tax countries where exactly primarily in ireland and bermuda they explain how a massive industry exists to help companies evade taxes making clear that most of these tax dodges are illegal because us law prohibits any investment decision whose sole aim is to evade taxes for decades systematic tax evasion by major corporations was used as a pretext for lowering corporate tax rates in the name of supposedly closing loopholes the claim that closing loopholes would compensate for lost tax revenues resulting from lower corporate tax rates while supposedly accelerating economic growth has constituted the bipartisan consensus on tax policy and remains so to this day the authors write for the majority of the nation s political economic and intellectual elites slashing the corporate tax rate was the right thing to do during his presidency barack obama had advocated in favor of reducing it to 28 percent with a lower rate of 25 percent for manufacturers the capstone of this was trump s 2018 tax bill which slashed the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent this was part of an international process as trump s bill passed french president emmanuel macron vowed to cut the corporate tax from 33 percent to 25 percent between 2018 and 2022 the united kingdom was ahead of the curve it had started slashing its rate under labour prime minister gordon brown in 2008 and was aiming for 17 percent in 2020 on that issue the browns macrons and trumps of the world agree having presented this analysis saez and zucman explain what they propose to do about it they argue for increasing taxes on the wealthy including a tax on wealth increasing the top income tax bracket and raising the corporate tax rate while taxation would be used broadly to redistribute income to the level of inequality that existed in the 1930s the vast bulk of the cost of constructing a social welfare state would be borne by an effective tax increase on working people the majority of tax revenue would be raised with a flat national income tax affecting workers and capitalists alike this national income tax falling disproportionately on workers would then be used to finance a government run health insurance program public child care and free education the authors write the good news is that we can fix tax injustice right now there is nothing inherent in globalization that destroys our ability to tax big companies and the wealthy the choice is ours when it comes to the future of taxation everything is possible from the disappearance of the income tax a plausible outcome if the trend of the last four decades is sustained to levels of progressivity never seen before there is an infinity of possible futures ahead of us but this infinity of possible futures does not include the overthrow of capitalism saez and zucman argue on the basis of a premise which they never state much less seek to defend that private ownership of the means of production should be continued and maintained they want to treat the symptom inequality of the disease capitalism without attempting to argue against those who say that the symptom cannot be treated outside of eradicating the disease the word capitalism appears only twice throughout the book this is not surprising because the volume treats the capitalist socioeconomic order as effectively the fixed basis of analysis saez and zucman never attempt to answer the most important question what happens when the wealthy resist paying more in taxes what political means are required to end inequality the unstated premise is that this change can be carried out through the democratic party including candidates such as elizabeth warren and bernie sanders who advocate policies similar to those of the authors but since saez and zucman don t argue for this course of action they don t have to deal with the myriad problems that arise from it how will the democrats the party that first cut taxes on the rich under johnson and presided over the deregulation of wall street under clinton then bailed out the banks obama be made into the instrument of as the authors call it confiscatory taxation within the book s analytical framework if governments reduced taxes on the rich it was because opinions changed if opinions can be changed back then governments can undo the policies that led to the growth of inequality except there must have been some reason that opinions changed saez and zucman do not attempt to root the phenomenal processes they discuss in broader historical changes what after all is the relationship between the fact that the 20th century was viewed as the so called american century based on american global economic hegemony and the socially redistributive character of the new deal as well as the confiscatory tax policy of roosevelt and eisenhower leon trotsky did not beat around the bush when he declared america s wealth permits roosevelt his experiments the fact is that a return to the new deal is simply not possible the financial oligarchy would fight such a plan tooth and nail there is no wing of the ruling elite as there was in roosevelt s day which argues that us capitalism should reduce social inequality to head off revolution there is of course is an enormous constituency for social redistribution the working class but its struggles will be animated in the coming period not by a desire to put patches on capitalism but to do away with it altogether regardless of these criticisms wsws readers should read this book for its valuable documentation and analysis of social inequality and the explanation of the role that tax policy has played in its growth
almost 18 months since it began in earnest the us china trade war remains one of the biggest causes of uncertainty and sleepless nights for investors as they seek to navigate an environment of slowing growth and increasingly volatile markets according to analysts and investment strategists that may not change next year even if us president donald trump fails to secure re election to the white house analysts said advertisement advertisement belinda boa head of active investments for asia pacific and chief investment officer for emerging markets at blackrock said the world s biggest asset manager is being far more cautious as it looks ahead to next year and believes geopolitical risks including the trade war will be the key driver for the economy and markets in asia next year trade policy is and has been increasingly unpredictable and we ve seen a surge in trade protectionism boa said this deviates from decades of globalisation and of free trade we re moving in a very different direction of more than a dozen market strategists interviewed for this story a majority remained positive about equities generally including chinese stocks in 2020 given the low interest rate environment and an expected recovery in corporate earnings next year they warned however that returns could be modest or moderate saying the trade war and the us elections were among the biggest risks to markets next year when we think about how we live our lives whether it s how we educate our children whether it s how we travel whether it s how we do business this is a move away from globalisation and we don t think that it s going to stop boa said she said blackrock expects more modest returns for investors next year as the macroeconomic environment further weakens recession risks could also rise later in the year as the us china relationship and the american elections in 2020 create further uncertainty according to blackrock advertisement advertisement since july of last year the us has placed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of chinese goods as president trump tries to force beijing to change decades of industrial and trade policies it is one of the few areas that attracts bipartisan support in an increasingly polarised political environment in washington story continues president trump announced a substantial phase one deal between the countries in october but no agreement has been signed as sticking points remain over whether the us will rescind tariffs on chinese goods as well as purchases of american agricultural goods by china top negotiators from both countries spoke by phone this week to discuss their core concerns and try to keep communications open president trump also told reporters earlier this week the sides were in the final throes of negotiating a deal sparking optimism among investors but hong kong has become a potential flash point in the discussions after president trump signed into law on thursday legislation that could make the government subject to diplomatic action and economic sanctions brushing off warnings from beijing about interfering in its affairs if no agreement is reached further tariffs are set to go into place on december 15 the dispute between the world s two biggest economies has weighed on business investment and global commerce with trade contracting by 1 3 per cent in september the latest data available according to the cpb netherlands bureau for economic policy analysis advertisement advertisement pascal blanque group chief investment officer at asset manager amundi said the decline in trade is causing a major change in the structure of growth globally but does not point to a full blown recession next year particularly as the us and china appear to be moving closer to a partial trade deal shipping

is unlikely given the upcoming us elections in 2020 however the path for investors will not be linear advertisement advertisement in the short term market expectations for policy actions have gone too far and need to be adjusted the adjustment process will drive volatility in bonds with a bottoming out of core bond yields having already started and re rating in some expensive defensive sectors in equity timothy moe chief asia pacific regional equity strategist at goldman sachs said optimism in the market had been growing that a partial phase one deal can be reached rising from a 10 per cent to a 15 per cent chance in the summer and then climbing further to a 70 per cent chance recently the point here is that the market has already reflected optimism about a deal and therefore relative to the actual news flow the way the market is likely to respond to that news flow is arguably negatively skewed moe said in other words if we have good news the market probably is flat to up somewhat if we have bad news there s a lot of price gains to give back donald j trump realdonaldtrump november 17 2019 advertisement advertisement steven oh the global head of credit and fixed income at asset manager pinebridge investments said the most significant headwind to the global economy this year has been the escalation of the trade war as well as regional political risks such as the united kingdom s move to exit the european union political risks will linger next year and have the potential to quickly shift investor sentiment oh said rising discontent in developed countries stemming from income inequality is leading to more populist governments and nationalism which fuels protectionist policies that hinder global trade he said this is a trend that is unfortunately likely to continue irrespective of which parties emerge victorious mark haefele chief investment officer for ubs global wealth management and min lan tan head of its asia pacific chief investment office said an escalation of tariffs this year has caused heightened investor anxiety but the dispute is not likely to become a full on cold war the relationship between the us and china may never be the same patience for beijing to acquiesce to western rules has run out in the us and china is unlikely to jettison its governance model to appease the white house haefele and tan said in the firm s year ahead 2020 report advertisement advertisement a confrontational stance against china has gained bipartisan support in the us making it likely that the spat started by the trump administration will continue into the coming years regardless of the party in power likewise president xi s proclamations that china will not bow to foreign pressure have made it difficult for the central government to backtrack and agree to key us demands without losing face that said the ubs strategists said they expect more complicated issues between the two countries may be pushed down the road allowing gradual progress to be made over the course of 2020 and a de escalation of tariff issues eric moffett portfolio manager at t rowe price s asia opportunities strategy said he has been avoiding companies and sectors that can fall victim to us china issues because of the uncertainty it creates we have a very interesting internal debate here i think there is a bull case one could spin that a trade deal even a watered down one could be very good for markets if it involves those tariffs coming down moffett said conversely you could argue that some of the difficulties in the relationship may persist and so when i invest i try to invest away from that macro and in things that are not so sensitive to us china trade advertisement advertisement moffett noted that valuations of asian equities remain reasonable relative to the rest of the world and historic levels kevin anderson head of investments asia pacific at state street global advisers said the asset manager is having to make very careful decisions in today s markets but believes there are opportunities for investors as economic growth is expected to be resilient next year as central banks take more dovish policy stances at the end of 2019 we are in a late cycle we are beset by continuing political uncertainty and unconventional policy anderson said in short the waters that we have to navigate are getting choppier and more

gas tax collections by the state have barely increased over the past five years just 2 5 percent since fiscal year 2015 the first full year after lawmakers last increased the tax by 3 cents to 24 cents a gallon according to massachusetts tax collection data but as the massachusetts legislature prepares to debate a massive fix to the state s beleaguered transportation system one that could include a stiff increase in the gas tax they might take note that it may not be such a reliable source of revenue for much longer for public officials around the nation looking to fix beat up roads and bridges or buy new buses and subway cars it s one of the most reliable turns in the playbook raise the gas tax and watch the money flow in advertisement this despite a period of powerful economic growth in greater boston that added hundreds of thousands of more vehicles to the roads and saw the rise of uber and lyft from spunky upstarts to transportation powerhouses providing more than 80 million rides in a year as well as high speed delivery service from amazon and other retailers that have flooded streets with trucks get metro headlines the 10 top local news stories from metro boston and around new england delivered daily enter email sign up the main driver behind this trend is long developing improvements in fuel efficiency as more and more motorists get around to replacing older cars with hybrids and vehicles that get significantly higher gas mileage even supporters of a gas tax increase acknowledge that it simply isn t keeping pace with the growth in driving and may not be reliable over the long term the gas tax is not and should not be a sustainable revenue stream for supporting our ongoing investment in transportation infrastructure said james rooney president of the greater boston chamber of commerce which backs a 15 cent gas tax phased in over three years we re trying to reduce emissions and consumption of gasoline he said adding that at some point gasoline will fade away as a fuel source for vehicles advertisement given the state of traffic on pretty much any day of the week one would think the state would be rolling in money from the gas tax and true collections were at an all time high last fiscal year about 675 million but that s not much more than the 658 million the state collected between july 2014 and june 2015 meanwhile the rate of driving in massachusetts since around then has surged by at least 8 9 percent according to data the state reports to the federal government the erosion of gas tax collections is only going to accelerate with the emergence of electric cars they re still in their advent around massachusetts but while sales remain modest they are accelerating fast almost doubling in a single year to around 9 000 in 2018 according to the association of global automakers moreover officials in massachusetts have outlined a goal to end the sale of gas powered vehicles in the state by 2040 and auto manufacturers seem increasingly close to breaking into the mass market with new models of electric cars from the midpriced tesla sedan to ford s debut of a new electric mustang muscle car the electric cars are getting better there s more charging people are getting more comfortable with electric said craig carlson a boston based automotive consultant carlson predicted that by 2025 electric vehicles may be popular enough to be a drag on gas tax collections time wise that s not far away for a state legislature that has often let years go by between major transportation initiatives advertisement right now there aren t a lot of viable alternatives to the gas tax in use earlier this year the federal highway administration said it awarded seven states including new hampshire and california a total of 10 million to study other ways to raise money for road works most of these efforts revolve around charging motorists based on how much they drive rather than how much gas they buy oregon has a program that charges car owners by the mile currently 1 7 cents participants volunteer to be in the program and receive a credit on the fuel taxes they pay through the year utah is launching a pilot program that will waive annual registration fees for owners of electric and hybrid vehicles and instead charge them 1 5 cents for every mile they drive efforts to undertake similar experiments have waxed and waned in massachusetts even so local transit advocates and business leaders note that an increase in the gas tax would still raise gobs of money upfront crucial for a state with a public transit system that has a seemingly inexhaustible amount of repairs and upgrades to make other funding initiatives may be more productive in the long term they say but would not immediately generate the money they believe the roads and rails need right now most estimates show that every 1 cent increase to the gas tax would raise an additional 30 million in revenue advertisement yes the world is going to look different in 30 years said chris dempsey director of the nonprofit transportation for massachusetts but the reason to raise the gas tax isn t to face a 30 year issue it s to face an issue today a gas tax hike was widely expected to be a major component in a house of representatives initiative to generate new transportation revenue this fall but house leaders delayed action until at least this winter as members struggled to finalize a plan key lawmakers in the house were not available for comment last week the last gas tax increase in 2013 was the first adjustment in two decades at the time lawmakers also indexed the tax to the rate of inflation so it would rise automatically but voters repealed that aspect of the law a year later since then gas tax receipts have risen at less than the rate of inflation according to bureau of labor statistics massachusetts has the 31st highest gas tax in the country according to the tax foundation a washington d c tax policy nonprofit the falling value of the gas tax has also been a concern of those who study transportation at the federal level the national gas tax has remained at the same level since 1993 and economists have cited increasing fuel efficiency as a reason to explore other ways to fund roads such as through tolls or mileage based fees advertisement massachusetts lawmakers flirted with this concept in 2016 when they agreed to test a program that would charge drivers based on miles driven because of concerns that the gas tax may eventually become obsolete the measure was vetoed by governor charlie baker who said he could not support such a fee if it was in addition to the gas tax meanwhile some environmental advocates caution against assigning specific taxes or fees to electric vehicles too soon today the lower cost of operating an electric vehicle is a major factor for people in abandoning gas powered cars said staci rubin an attorney with the conservation law foundation we need to incentivize them she said if we re at a point in the future where we have widespread electric vehicles that s great and then we can rethink revenue while the gas tax would likely be part of a legislative package some business leaders have called on lawmakers to take a more comprehensive approach that at least acknowledges that gas taxes are likely to have less power over time at the chamber of commerce for example rooney wants the legislature to create a task force to study other forms of pricing the roads such as increased tolls or other technology to account for a future with fewer gas powered cars and to report back with a plan in a year that idea won more support from rooney s peers in the business community than a gas tax hike which has divided employer groups across the state associated industries of massachusetts for example has argued it would be unfair to lower income people or those with no alternatives to driving but according to a survey compiled by the chamber there is more support within the business community for studying alternative roadway pricing ideas a gas tax hike would likely be divisive among voters too as a recent poll by the massinc polling group found most voters would oppose a one time 15 cent increase though the poll found narrow support for three 5 cent increases phased in over time a majority of respondents also said they would oppose adding tolls to routes 95 or 93 and were closely divided over whether to charge higher tolls at peak periods with 46 percent in support and 47 percent opposed more popular ideas were to tap into real estate developers for money and apply higher fees to ride hailing trips but the overwhelming majority of those polled agreed on one thing 77 percent said the state needs more transportation revenue the baker administration has long argued that it does not need to increase taxes or fees to pay for transportation though it has implemented two mbta fare hikes within the last four years to help fill transit budget gaps baker has also said he opposes a gas tax hike but is supporting a new kind of fee on motor fuels this would be instituted by states in the northeast on wholesale fuel suppliers as way to put a price on carbon emissions from motor vehicles and ultimately reduce tailpipe emissions this too won wide support in the poll the governor has also largely opposed the idea of congestion pricing using tolls to discourage some driving in busy parts of boston while raising revenue to improve public transit however he has suggested the state will consider creating separate travel lanes on highways where commuters can pay higher tolls to bypass traffic in adjacent lanes adam vaccaro can be reached at adam vaccaro globe com follow him on twitter at adamtvaccaro

share pin 0 shares like like love haha wow sad angry 2 thyblackman com it s virtually undisputed that america faces a retirement problem if not crisis many americans lack sufficient savings to safeguard their retirement according to the st louis federal reserve and others a combination of low savings rates longer life expectancy and declining prevalence of corporate pensions are generating this crisis which is coming to a head with 10 000 baby boomers turning 65 every day an additional problem facing retirees is that their savings generate less income than in the past in 2000 the 10 year treasury yielded over 7 today it yields less than 2 a retiree today needs to have three times as much saved to generate the same interest income as 20 years ago or invest in riskier assets fortunately the federal government could take action to protect americans from low interest rates and boost retiree income at little to no cost by launching a new treasury bond program to combat the dearth of income the treasury should let every american citizen not foreign investors or corporations buy a perpetual bond with a yield of 5 to ensure this program helps those in the middle and working classes who are at the epicenter of the retirement crisis and to keep wealthy americans from receiving an excessive amount of risk free income there would be a cap on the amount of this bond anyone could own 50 000 at 18 100 000 at 30 150 000 at 40 200 000 at 50 and 250 000 at 60 this program would allow individuals to save for retirement and earn a reasonable return and then in retirement have a secure income a married couple with a 500 000 nest egg could lock in a guaranteed 25 000 income stream combined with the average social security benefit of 17 000 year they would have 42 000 in income before accounting for any other savings they may have enough for most to have a secure retirement with this 5 locked in for life retirees would never have to worry about federal reserve rate policy or treasury market gyrations on this portion of their savings this secure treasury bond program would clearly improve the living standard of retirees but what about the cost fortunately this program could be implemented at minimal if any the net cost to taxpayers first these perpetual bonds would replace existing treasury securities in circulation meaning even with a 1 trillion deficit the us treasury could fund entirely off this platform for some time assuming 50 of the 250 million americans over 18 participated with an average investment of 100 000 there would be 12 5 trillion of these securities paying 625 billion in interest assuming these perpetual bonds replace treasuries that would yield 2 the net cost is 375 billion per year 3 of 12 5 trillion however the true cost would be materially lower as noted above these bonds would be perpetual giving retirees guaranteed income for life but there is no set maturity these bonds could be structured to pay back upon death at about 80 in a sense retirees would trade off higher sustained income for the duration of their life with a lower estate value to pass on to their heirs assuming these bonds are held on average ten years the federal government would enjoy 250 billion of debt forgiveness per year on net this program would cost about 125 billion per year however some of this cost will be mitigated by higher interest income tax revenue in addition retirees with more income will be able to spend more while those preparing for retirement will be able to save less knowing they can earn 5 on 250 000 allowing them to spend more today these benefits should boost us economic activity thereby increasing tax revenue as such this program will likely cost taxpayers less than 50 billion per year or 1 2 of the federal budget a small price to protect the retirements of millions of middle class americans furthermore when the fed cuts interest rates that generally helps boost growth but the loss of income to savers does limit the growth benefit of lower rates by essentially segregating a pool of retirement savings from fed policy the central bank could more effectively implement interest policy to ensure full employment and stable prices helping americans feel secure in retirement should be a bipartisan policy particularly when the benefits flow mainly to middle and working class households and there is a minimal net cost to taxpayers that is why i call on president trump and congressional democrats to work together to create this 5 perpetual bond program president trump succeeded in the 2016 presidential election because his conservative populism and america first agenda appealed to many working and middle class americans who felt the political establishments of both parties had left them behind to succeed again in 2020 trump cannot merely point to successes in his first term he must also offer a positive vision of what policies he aims to implement in a second term a fiscally responsible way to help americans save for and enjoy retirement while maintaining an expansionary low interest rate environment would be a compelling part of a policy platform so if congressional democrats refuse to work with him to implement a proposal along the lines of a 5 perpetual bond program president trump should pledge to make it a first 100 day item of his second term and let democrats try to explain why going nowhere impeachment hearings were a better use of their time than securing millions of retirements written by scott ruesterholz official website
academics might be professionals in meeting expectations ok what do i mean by that it s ridiculous that professors are hailed as these keepers of originality and critical examination all i ever saw was meeting expectations in order to get good grades and graduate and then finding consensus in order to get published i mean i have heard a professor literally say he need ed to go back and look at the data in a different way because his current results would never get the funding he needed show me a professor always against the grain and ill show you an academic that never gets tenure here is the truth academics are just as likely to rely on emotion as everyone else is my fellow academics taken as a group are just as reluctant to engage in genuine reflection as the less highly educated person in the street academics have always been afflicted by unusually high levels of conformity to expectations one of the chief ways you prove yourself worthy of an academic life is by getting very good grades and you don t get very good grades without saying the sorts of things that your professors like to hear alan jacobs how to think

for a company like coopers but they do allow the company to get its products into new markets with less red tape and at a lower price with beer importers they tend to import from all around the world so they might compare coopers with another product from another market with no free trade agreement so they might think they will go with coopers because of the fta but for all the talk of a dining

declined proportionally relative to mining even as the whole dollar figures have risen

beer and malt extracts used for cereal and confectionery australian produce and products are increasingly finding their way into asian markets everyone it seems wants a piece of the pastry economist tim harcourt is in no doubt that we are moving from a mining boom to a dining boom most of it is based on the growing middle class in asean improving living standards and to some extent a reduction in

james alcock at the other end of the scale to the carlton cafe is the consolidated pastoral company cpc a 600 million beef cattle behemoth that has 300 000 head of cattle over 3 2 million hectares across western australia the northern territory and queensland cpc is the largest private cattle company in australia and currently in the middle of a management buyout from its majority european owners it also owns two feed lots on indonesia s island of sumatra to which it sends about 60 000 live cattle per year that accounts for about 60 per cent of the company s revenue with the balance

of a company that has been operating in indonesia for 20 years and he s a little cautious in embracing it we are certainly seeing a couple of things he says first there is a growing population in asia who like our produce and really good produce at that and second average incomes are increasing significantly and once you step up in income you step up in calorie consumption and higher quality calorie consumption we market meat that comes from cpc into indonesia as safe nutritious trustworthy and reliable setter estimates that in an average supermarket in jakarta 15 per cent of the meat

twenty years since the great seattle anti capitalist revolt this article is over 4 years 4 months old by charlie kimber downloading pdf please wait there was a heavy police presence at the protests twenty years ago demonstrations street occupations and riots at a meeting of the world trade organisation wto signalled the birth of a new opposition to the people at the top of the political and economic system the protests in seattle in the united states showed the bitter anger at the elite who ruled the world they popularised the phrase anti capitalism the economist bosses magazine wrote ten months later the protesters are right to say that the most urgent political moral and economic question of our time is third world poverty they are also right to say the wave of globalisation however powerful it may be can be turned back it is the fact that these two things are true which makes the protesters and crucially the current of opinion that sympathises with them so terribly dangerous activists had prepared the protests for months in advance the wto was chosen as a symbol of everything that was wrong with economic globalisation carried out in the interests of profit the wto s trade policies encouraged the destruction of the environment its leading members enforced ruinous debts on poorer countries it opened everything to the control of the multinationals seattle was the showdown with those who acted as the masters of the capitalist universe days before the main protests began over 2 500 people came to a teach in on globalisation the wto and the alternatives at 6 30am there were 150 people queuing for returned tickets and touts selling entry at inflated prices inside the meeting people listened intently to 40 speakers over a period of ten hours without a break the loudest applause was for speakers who tore into capitalism and called for a total rejection of the wto s priorities roamed the day before the wto was supposed to begin thousands of activists roamed the streets protesting about environmental destruction some of them dressed as sea turtles a species that was protected by a law that the wto threatened to abolish in the early evening 5 000 people made a human chain to end third world debt and marched to encircle the site of the wto s opening gala in driving rain they chanted we re all wet cancel the debt early the next morning as the conference was supposed to begin thousands of people took over key intersections around the convention centre with arms linked or locked on to each other and street furniture they blocked every road the gilded elite of the wto emerged from their hotels to find themselves unable to get through the morning session was cancelled protesters numbers grew as a march from the city s poorest areas arrived to reinforce the blockades students who had walked out from schools and colleges joined the actions enraged the police attacked protesters with tear gas and rubber bullets but the blockades held just as the attacks intensified around 25 000 trade unionists marched in from a rally that had been held on the outskirts of the city the union leaders plan was to stay separate from the radicals on the streets but first a few individuals and then thousands rushed to join them this was the moment when famously teamsters and turtles united the police swooped in with new determination firing percussion grenades and arresting scores of people but the protesters had won the wto was hugely disrupted the next day hundreds of national guard troops were deployed alongside more police to create a protest free zone in the city when trade unionists and others marched they were attacked rounded up and hundreds taken on buses to jail continued but protests continued at a lower level for two more days emphasising how the authorities had lost control it was a huge victory giving renewed hope to those who had despaired that the neoliberal juggernaut could be stopped it changed those who took part amber pattison who travelled 1 000 miles to seattle said i came here to protest about the killing of turtles i m going home determined to turn the whole world upside down socialist worker s editor chris harman wrote afterwards sometimes the symbolism of events gives them an importance out of all proportion to the numbers of people directly involved in them the demonstrations themselves were not particularly large but they signalled something of enormous importance almost exactly ten years earlier the fall of the berlin wall had been presented as the end of socialism leaving capitalism in apparently unchallenged control for the rest of humanity s existence seattle was the eruption of a new challenge and the protests represented a process of political generalisation it was the system that was now being targeted not just some specific injustice after seattle there were repeated mobilisations directed at various neoliberal gatherings these reached a climax at the g8 summit in genoa italy in july 2001 more than 300 000 people demonstrated after riot police murdered a young protester carlo giuliani the annual world social forum beginning in porto alegre brazil in january 2001 became a focus for organising debating and theorising movements grow from and in turn inspire new ways of expressing discontent anarchist chris dixon one of the seattle organisers wrote recently about how steelworkers and environmental group earth first came together the steelworkers were involved in a protracted fight with their employer kaiser aluminum which had locked them out in early 1999 kaiser was owned by maxxam and headed by infamous ceo charles hurwitz who also owned pacific lumber the company clear cutting old growth redwood forests in northern california earth first had been involved in direct action efforts to protect those forests since the 1980s identifying their common enemy the locked out steelworkers and the forest defenders began collaborating on protests and spending time together on picket lines and in tree sits the seattle revolt had deep roots the collapse of the russian and east european regimes at the end of the 1980s was followed by ruthless imposition of neoliberal economic and social shock therapy in large parts of the world important landmarks were the zapatista rising in chiapas mexico at the beginning of 1994 the french public sector strikes of 1995 and the 1998 mass movement in indonesia that brought down the dictator suharto who had ruled for 31 years new movements grow from and in turn inspire new ways of expressing discontent books such as 29 year old naomi klein s no logo written before and published just after the seattle protests were read and discussed by big audiences of activists it was translated into more than 30 languages with more than a million copies in print worldwide the rise of anti capitalism after seattle posed challenges for the left the first necessary step was to see the protest as immensely positive not everyone on the left managed this some condemned violence by protesters others wrongly saw the protests as mainly nationalist others were horrified by a new language affinity groups arrestables and non arrestables and much more and meetings where people communicated with hand signals the most ineffective approach was to seek to squeeze all the new energy into existing channels the best response was to recognise that we had much to learn we could not stand apart lecturing people and telling them they had simply to hitch their energy to our cherished projects it was necessary to stress the 80 percent we all agreed on not the 20 percent where we disagreed but socialists also had and have something to contribute above all we could bring an insistence that change was possible only on the basis of a workers revolution we could not accept as the french revolutionary daniel bensaid put it utopias based on the regulation of free markets keynesian utopias and above all neo libertarian utopias in which the world can be changed without taking power revolutionaries could raise key issues about the role of the working class the 9 11 attacks and the imperialist offensive of the war on terror marked the end of the phase triggered by seattle many of those involved especially in britain became part of the anti war movement that was less true in the us but the experience is crucial as today we take up again seattle s slogan another world is possible another world is necessary

arrived to reinforce the blockades students who had walked out from schools and colleges joined the actions enraged the police attacked protesters with tear gas and rubber bullets but the blockades held just as the attacks intensified around 25 000 trade unionists marched in from a rally that had been held on the outskirts of the city the union leaders plan was to stay separate from the radicals on the streets but first a few individuals and then thousands rushed to join them this was the moment when famously teamsters and turtles united the police swooped in with new determination firing percussion grenades and arresting scores of people but the protesters had won the wto was hugely disrupted the next day hundreds of national guard troops were deployed alongside more police to create a protest free zone in the city when trade unionists and others marched they were attacked rounded up and hundreds taken on buses to jail continued but protests continued at a lower level for two more days emphasising how the authorities had lost control it was a huge victory giving renewed hope to those who had despaired that the neoliberal juggernaut could be stopped it changed those who took part amber pattison who travelled 1 000 miles to seattle said i came here to protest about the killing of turtles i m going home determined to turn the whole world upside down socialist worker s editor chris harman wrote afterwards sometimes the symbolism of events gives them an importance out of all proportion to the numbers of people directly involved in them the demonstrations themselves were not particularly large but they signalled something of enormous importance almost exactly ten years earlier the fall of the berlin wall had been presented as the end of socialism leaving capitalism in apparently unchallenged control for the rest of humanity s existence seattle was the eruption of a new challenge and the protests represented a process of political generalisation it was the system that was now being targeted not just some specific injustice after seattle there were repeated mobilisations directed at various neoliberal gatherings these reached a climax at the g8 summit in genoa italy in july 2001 more than 300 000 people demonstrated after riot police murdered a young protester carlo giuliani the annual world social forum beginning in porto alegre brazil in january 2001 became a focus for organising debating and theorising movements grow from and in turn inspire new ways of expressing discontent anarchist chris dixon one of the seattle organisers wrote recently about how steelworkers and environmental group earth first came together the steelworkers were involved in a protracted fight with their employer kaiser aluminum which had locked them out in early 1999 kaiser was owned by maxxam and headed by infamous ceo charles hurwitz who also owned pacific lumber the company clear cutting old growth redwood forests in northern california earth first had been involved in direct action efforts to protect those forests since the 1980s identifying their common enemy the locked out steelworkers and the forest defenders began collaborating on protests and spending time together on picket lines and in tree sits the seattle revolt had deep roots the collapse of the russian and east european regimes at the end of the 1980s was followed by ruthless imposition of neoliberal economic and social shock therapy in large parts of the world important landmarks were the zapatista rising in chiapas mexico at the beginning of 1994 the french public sector strikes of 1995 and the 1998 mass movement in indonesia that brought down the dictator suharto who had ruled for 31 years new movements grow from and in turn inspire new ways of expressing discontent books such as 29 year old naomi klein s no logo written before and published just after the seattle protests were read and discussed by big audiences of activists it was translated into more than 30 languages with more than a million copies in print worldwide the rise of anti capitalism after seattle posed challenges for the left the first necessary step was to see the protest as immensely positive not everyone on the left managed this some condemned violence by protesters others wrongly saw the protests as mainly nationalist others were horrified by a new language affinity groups arrestables and non arrestables and much more and meetings where people communicated with hand signals the most ineffective approach was to seek to squeeze all the new energy into existing channels the best response was to recognise that we had much to learn we could not stand apart lecturing people and telling them they had simply to hitch their energy to our cherished projects it was necessary to stress the 80 percent we all agreed on not the 20 percent where we disagreed but socialists also had and have something to contribute above all we could bring an insistence that change was possible only on the basis of a workers revolution we could not accept as the french revolutionary daniel bensaid put it utopias based on the regulation of free markets keynesian utopias and above all neo libertarian utopias in which the world can be changed without taking power revolutionaries could raise key issues about the role of the working class the 9 11 attacks and the imperialist offensive of the war on terror marked the end of the phase triggered by seattle many of those involved especially in britain became part of the anti war movement that was less true in the us but the experience is crucial as today we take up again seattle s slogan another world is possible another world is necessary
cybercrime is flourishing in venezuela as the country s deepening economic and political crisis drives thousands into the underground criminal world according to a report released thursday by intsights a global threat intelligence company intsights analysts discovered large scale and sophisticated efforts to steal personal information from people in latin america who work for a variety of companies such as banks and retailers and then either sell that information online or use it to collect even more data the hackers are based in venezuela and neighboring countries like colombia where many venezuelan refugees have settled these information gathering operations are particularly lucrative for venezuelans as they are sold for cryptocurrency such as bitcoin a welcome alternative to the country s own currency which has endured rapid inflation and they re not subtle about it specific information about the operations like who the hackers are where they are located and even hackers phone numbers are surprisingly easy to find according to charity wright an analyst at intsights normally experienced hackers operating in countries such as russia china and vietnam hide by taking on alternate identities and profiles to throw people off they don t seem too concerned about hiding wright said i think it s because they don t sense law enforcement will do anything venezuelan opposition activists demonstrate against president nicolas maduro in caracas on july 6 2017 federico parra afp via getty images file venezuela s hyperinflation has caused a deterioration of the national currency and in turn many venezuelans have turned to cryptocurrencies the international monetary fund says inflation of the venezuelan bolivar the country s currency is expected to hit a startling 200 000 percent this year a cup of coffee that cost 150 bolivars in november 2018 now costs 18 000 bolivars according to bloomberg venezuela was once one of the wealthiest countries in latin america with the world s largest oil reserves and vast gold deposits but decades of corruption and mismanagement under socialist rule have led its economy to ruin in the past year protests have turned deadly after crackdowns by the government of president nicolás maduro the country has also endured sizable blackouts venezuela based cybercrime efforts span a variety of common digital misdeeds including large scale email phishing efforts and malware campaigns sensitive information collected through successful hacks is then sold on various public websites and on the dark web the report indicates victims don t receive much cooperation from the government when they file complaints because of the economic and political turmoil in the country as a result local law enforcement is turning a blind eye censorship in venezuela has caused hackers to openly use social media the government blocks many websites such as cnn and el nacional a popular national newspaper even the walkie talkie app zello which was popular among venezuelans during the protests has been blocked people have turned to virtual private networks vpns which help sidestep internet censorship and the tor browser a free and open source software that enables anonymous communication but even vpns and tor have been banned by venezuela s state owned internet provider cantv venezuelans now rely heavily on social media apps such as instagram snapchat facebook and twitter as well as the messaging app whatsapp for information because of the censorship cybercriminals have also turned to social media apps to collaborate and find work wright said many of the venezuelan cybercriminals intsights found appeared to use their own photos on social media and accurate descriptions of where they live making it easy to find out who they are cybercurrency makes cybercrime easier wright said for a long time bitcoin was used by people that were into technology she said cryptocurrencies have become a widely used form of payment in venezuela according to wright the venezuelan government created its own digital currency dubbed the petro in february 2018 more than 4 million venezuelans have fled the country in recent years to escape low wages a collapsing health care system the absence of basic services and the lack of security the majority are settling in neighboring colombia with limited work opportunities many venezuelans have turned to cybercrime as an alternative for making money the venezuelan underground has risen to the surface with the anarchy and chaos of the maduro regime said tom kellermann head of cybersecurity strategy for cloud computer company vmware and a global fellow for cyberpolicy at the wilson center while the most prolific cybercriminal underground in south america is in brazil considered one of the top four most sophisticated in the world venezuela s hacking community has become more brazen because of the chaos that is currently ongoing in the country according to kellermann the report has a bleak outlook for the future the maduro regime s priorities do not include protecting infrastructure or global enterprises at the moment the report states it says that even if corporations went directly to venezuelan opposition leader juan guaído recognized as the legitimate leader by the u s and about 50 other nations there is little that his government can do to control the cybercrime emerging from venezuela
earlier this year flamboyant israeli american entrepreneur adam neumann sold the word we to a corporate investor for 5 9 million dollars earlier this year flamboyant israeli american entrepreneur adam neumann sold the word we to a corporate investor for 5 9 million dollars he was shamed into giving it back not owing to that transaction s brashness but because it was just a cash in the crack of the couch throw in to the even larger fandangle several months earlier neuman was figger n on bigger n and bigger he did he bagged 4 4 billion of walking around money during a 12 minute stroll through his swanky digs with that same investor he had no clear business plan but the long haired dooby smoking frat boy levered his unbounded enthusiasm in a hand shook deal which the gullible japanese financier could afford to lose good thing he could afford it just a few weeks ago neumann was given 1 7 billion in exchange for his promise to stop coming to work in the morning if there are any kindly overseas investors reading this article i ve got a full sentence for sale for a meagre 1 000 000 what on earth was i thinking it s a bargain and can be re used in several different situations better still three full paragraphs from our rbc economics team to discuss the current state of markets in canada after keeping noticeably quiet in recent months the bank of canada gave us a bit more food for thought in its november statement trade tensions were a key theme with both governor poloz and senior deputy governor wilkins noting that the us china trade war could cost the global economy around 1 trillion in lost output by 2021 while that s taking a toll on canada s economy the impact to date hasn t been significant enough for the bank of canada to join its global counterparts in lowering rates one reason it has remained on the sidelines is household debt regarding october s steady rate decision wilkins reiterated that taking out insurance against downside risks wasn t worth the cost of adding to vulnerabilities around high household debt down the road that said the bank has opened the door to a rate cut and will continue to weigh the costs and benefits of such insurance in the coming months our forecast is for a 1 5 per cent annualized increase in q3 gdp just a touch stronger than the bank of canada s 1 3 per cent projection both would be down from average but choppy growth of 2 1 per cent over the first half of the year the negative impact of global trade tensions will be evident in soft business investment also weighed down by ongoing challenges in the energy sector and weaker exports we expect the two combined to shave about 3 4 of a per cent off growth in q3 that leaves households to do much of the heavy lifting with housing activity alone likely contributing 1 2 per cent to growth lower market interest rates reflecting global central bank easing have helped spur on demand with mortgage debt now rising at its fastest quarterly pace since 2017 hence the bank s fresh worries about household debt as the bank noted in october the household sector will be key in upcoming monetary policy decisions signs that trade tensions and slowing global growth are having an effect beyond business investment and exports could make a dose of insurance worth the cost even an increase in trade tensions or more pronounced slowing in exports and investment could nudge rates downward however ongoing resilience in consumer spending and a further acceleration in housing activity would reduce the need and raise the cost we see the potential for a rate cut early next year although not likely sooner mark ryan is an investment advisor with rbc dominion securities inc member canadian investor protection fund and these are ryan s views and not those of rbc dominion securities this article is for information purposes only please consult with a professional advisor before taking any action based on information in this article see ryan s website at
for the last two years the trade conflict between the united states and china has dominated the economic and financial market debate with good reason after threats and accusations that long predated the 2016 us presidential election rhetoric has given way to action over the past 17 months the world s two largest economies have become embroiled in the most serious tariff war since the early 1930s and the weaponization of us trade policy to target perceived company specific threats such as chinese telecommunications equipment giant huawei has broadened the front in this battle from the start it has been a political conflict fought with economic weapons and could remain so in the foreseeable future what that means of course is that the economic and financial market outlook basically hinges on the political dynamics between the us and china has white house had enough of trade war in that vein the so called phase one skinny trade deal announced with great fanfare on oct 11 may be an important political signal while the deal if ever consummated will have next to no material economic impact it provides a strong hint that the white house has finally had enough of this trade war consumed by domestic political concerns especially impeachment hearings against the us president and the looming 2020 election it is in the white house s interest to declare victory and attempt to capitalize on it to counter the domestic problems china for its part would also like nothing more than to end the trade war politics may be very different in china but the chinese leadership is not about to capitulate on its core principles of sovereignty and its aspirational mid century goals of national rejuvenation growth and development at the same time there can be no mistaking downward pressures on the economy but with chinese policymakers determined to stay the course of their three year deleveraging campaign an important reason for the current slowdown they should be all the more eager to address the trade related pressures brought about by the us triggered trade war consequently the political calculus of both countries is coming into closer alignment with each looking for an end to the conflict there is always a risk that other complications will arise but at least for the time being the politics of the trade war are now pointing more toward de escalation rather than a renewed ratcheting up of tensions deglobalization can be ruled out if that is the case and if a phase one accord is reached it behoves us to ponder what the world will look like after the trade war several possibilities are at the top of my list deglobalization decoupling and trade diversion deglobalization is unlikely like the first wave of globalization that ended ignominiously between world war i and the great depression the current wave has generated a mounting backlash populism is rearing its ugly head around the world and tensions over income and wealth inequality aggravated by fears that technological innovations such as artificial intelligence will undermine job security are dominating the political discourse yet the climactic event that underscored the demise of the first wave of globalization was a 60 percent collapse in world trade in the early 1930s notwithstanding the current political dysfunction the odds of a similar outcome today are extremely low global decoupling too is unlikely reflecting the explosive growth in global value chains gvcs over the past 25 years the world is woven together more tightly than ever before that has transformed global competition away from the country specific paradigm of the past to a far more fragmented competition between widely distributed platforms of inputs components designs and assembly functions a recent international monetary fund study found that gvcs accounted for fully 73 percent of the rapid growth in global trade that occurred over the 20 year period from 1993 to 2013 enabled by irreversible trends of plunging transportation costs and technological breakthroughs in logistics and sourcing the gvc linkages that have come to underpin global economic integration are at little risk of decoupling us trade deficit shows domestic savings low trade diversion is a different matter altogether as i have long argued bilateral trade conflicts even bilateral decoupling can do nothing to resolve multilateral imbalances putting pressure on one of many trading partners precisely what the us is doing when it squeezes china in an effort to reduce its merchandise trade deficits with 102 countries is likely to backfire that s because america s multilateral trade deficit reflects a profound shortfall of domestic savings that will only get worse as the federal budget deficit now veers out of control so without addressing this chronic savings problem targeting china will mean pushing the chinese piece of the multilateral deficit on to the us other trading partners such diversion will shift trade to higher cost foreign sourcing the functional equivalent of a tax hike on us consumers trade truce or not a protracted economic struggle between the us and china has already begun a cease fire in the current battle could end up being a politically expedient pause in what is likely to be a long conflict which should worry the us which is devoid of a long term strategic framework china is not

billionaires aren t necessarily bad people and most of them probably aren t however some are and my unscientific sense is that billionaires are more likely than the rest of us to exhibit bad judgement warped by runaway egos especially in the political sphere it s not hard to see why great wealth attracts people eager to tell an extremely rich man or woman but political egotism is mainly a male thing what he wants to hear in the political arena this means telling billionaires both that their lavish financial rewards are a mere fraction of the vast contribution they have made to society and that the public is clamouring for them to take their rightful role as leaders put it this way these days many political factions are accused with varying degrees of justice of living in some kind of bubble out of touch with american reality but few live as thoroughly in a bubble as the billionaire class and its hangers on and now the billionaires in the bubble find themselves in an environment in which concerns about soaring inequality about the extraordinary concentration of wealth in the hands of the few finally seem to be getting political traction and they re not handling it well disconnect with reality obviously i m going to get to michael bloomberg in a minute first however let me talk about the economics and politics of billionaires in general so do billionaires in general make vast contributions to society to make that case you don t just have to argue that they ve earned their wealth by doing productive things you have to argue that their wealth is just part of what they ve added to national income and that s a hard argument to make when you look at how most billionaires have made their money after all many of them struck it rich in finance and real estate no help whatsoever now not that long ago the world economy was brought to its knees by the collapse of a huge real estate bubble which destabilised a financial system that had been drastically weakened by innovations that supposedly made us richer and that certainly enriched some wheeler dealers but that had it turned out greatly increased the risk of crisis do you really want to make the case that financial industry billionaires have been great benefactors the next biggest group of billionaires by the way made their money in fashion and retailing technology comes in only fourth and as anyone following the news knows some serious questions exist about the extent to which big fortunes in tech are modern versions of the monopoly spoils grabbed by old fashioned robber barons doing just fine it s also worth noting that the us economy used to get along fine without nearly as many billionaires as it has now american economic history since world war ii falls fairly neatly into two halves a first era ending roughly in 1980 during which progressive taxation strong unions and social norms limited extreme wealth accumulation at the top and the era of soaring inequality since then did the new prosperity of plutocrats trickle down to the nation as a whole not according to any measure i know for example multifactor productivity the standard economic measure of technological progress don t ask has risen only half as much since the 1980 turning point as it did in the previous era what about politics many people on wall street and a significant part of the punditocracy are socially liberal but economically conservative or at least leaning that way that is they are for racial equality and lgbtq rights but against major tax increases on the wealthy and big expansion in social programmes and that s a perfectly coherent point of view inside the billionaire bubble however people also imagine that it s a view with broad popular appeal well it isn t most people including many self identified republicans want to see higher taxes on the rich and increased spending on social programmes however quite a few people combine these sentiments with racial hostility and social illiberalism which is why they seem to vote against their own economic interests as best we can tell the constituency for social liberalism plus fiscal conservatism comprises only a few per cent of the electorate when howard schultz remember him ran that combination up the flagpole to see if anyone saluted only about 4 per cent of voters approved and early indications don t show bloomberg doing much better even though as someone who successfully ran new york he has a much better case to offer i m not saying that the us public is necessarily ready for the likes of elizabeth warren or bernie sanders i worry in particular about the politics of medicare for all not because of the cost but because proposing the abolition of private insurance could unnerve tens of millions of middle class voters

this article is more than 4 years old associated press remember aesop s fable about the grasshopper and the ant while the ant worked hard to store food the grasshopper sang and played believing the current time of plenty would still be there in the future while our economy enjoys a year of low unemployment low energy prices slight inflation record setting stock markets and corresponding growth in retirement portfolios we may be tempted like the grasshopper to think this plentiful trend will continue forever but it won t even in times of plenty the thoughtful person and the ant should always have an eye on preparing for a not so plentiful future congress is behaving like the grasshopper now spending its time gleefully dancing and singing partisan political songs in the meantime the people wish they were preparing for a future to stave off any crisis over the past few months manufacturing numbers in some sectors have flattened out this is the time to be passing legislation to strengthen manufacturing watching any news however you would think the only thing that mattered inside the beltway is vicious partisan warfare the us canada mexico trade agreement usmca is now coming up on its one year anniversary but so far congress has failed to act on it the north america free trade agreement is over 25 years old and needs to be updated that is where congress should be working nafta was negotiated by president george hw bush and implemented by president bill clinton it received bipartisan support in the democratically controlled senate and house when passed in 1993 nafta has its share of supporters and detractors since supporters say it increased us trade created five million us jobs and increased wages other benefits included protection of intellectual property opening up mexico for us small business opportunities and several trillion dollars in increased us trade nafta detractors claim however manufacturing jobs were lost in the us particularly in the automotive industries us wages were stifled as companies threatened to move to mexico and immigration increased as mexican workers crossed the border in search of better usa wages at the time mexican workers were viewed as suppressing us wages as they were willing to take us jobs in construction manufacturing and agriculture at lower levels than us workers because even those lower wages were preferable to mexican wages while automotive sector jobs did grow in mexico many us automotive jobs were actually replaced by automation while imported parts from china grew in the quarter century since nafta the world has changed china now is the largest manufacturer in the world the lower costs of chinese made goods have made it necessary for many us companies to close domestic manufacturing further eroding us jobs european nations now are joining together to negotiate their own trade agreements with the increased clout of their multi country strength immigration from mexico and central america into the usa continues to rise as workers seek better paying jobs several areas of trade agreements are out of date including intellectual property protection tariffs and markets across the us mexico and canada keeping nafta as is does not meet the demands of the current global economy the usmca is a better fit to our current economy while further strengthening the trilateral clout of these three nations and solidifies our role as the world s largest economic partners usmca grows us jobs and increases us trade automotive sector jobs are predicted to increase between 28 000 and 76 000 a big driver of these auto sector jobs is the requirement for more domestic content 75 must be made in these three countries and factories must pay greater than 16 00 per hour to workers making 40 of the parts this is particularly good news for the many small business manufacturers in the us the boost in wages for mexican workers not only helps us jobs but specifically addresses the low wage problems in mexico otherwise driving their workers to seek jobs in the usa us agriculture is strengthened assuring substantial growth in farming exports particularly in dairy and continued strong markets in grains exports in other sectors will also increase from the us to canada and mexico by over 33 billion while imports from those countries to the us will rise at lower amounts usmca strengthens intellectual property and copyrights across the countries at a time when patent infringement continues to be a major threat from low wage economies in asia unlike nafta the usmca must be reviewed every six years further assuring that it can respond to new demands and unanticipated problems across many sectors support for usmca comes from one thousand agriculture groups women small business owners and hundreds of other trade organizations representing millions of workers and thousands of businesses the world economies are dramatically different since 1993 and it is essential for our trade agreements to be updated to meet those changes at a time when the us has seen unprecedented growth in jobs and the economy congress needs to do all it can to encourage continued growth that s their job failure to pass usmca could slow down growth threatening jobs and further incursion of cheap imported good from countries with low wages and poor environmental records inaction or dancing like the smug grasshopper is not an option while other nations are aggressively pursuing their own economic and job growth we must put policy above politics and no longer hold us workers hostage with delays in this agreement it is time for speaker pelosi to schedule a vote on the usmca american workers deserve a vote to protect their jobs to get that vote congress has to do their job they would do well to learn a lesson from the ant

quarter gold recovered was 5 327oz a 35 increase compared to 3 951oz recovered in the same quarter last year as a result of higher feed grade and an improvement in the recovery rate due to timing for shipment and refinery first quarter gold production was 4 852oz a 47 increase compared to 3 308oz in the corresponding period of the previous year the average mill feed grade increased to 0 99g t from

due to an increase in the amount of leachable sulphide materials being processed high sulphide ores consumed more chemicals such as cyanide lime and oxygen to achieve better recoveries the ores are also harder which consumes more wear parts in crushing and steel balls in grinding to achieve target grinding size for optimum leaching condition additionally there was a stockpile reduction of 271k tonnes of super low grade ore arising from an updated stockpile survey which added a further 5 oz to cash costs financial results and discussion for the first quarter of 2020 q1 the selinsing gold mine generated a gross margin of 2 65 million before non cash amortization and accretion a decrease of 3 compared to 2 72 million in the same quarter last year the decrease in gross margin reflected a decrease in the amount of gold sold but at a higher average realized gold price offset by higher processing costs due to harder rock being fed into the mill net income for the quarter was 0 21 million or nil per share compared to 1 06 million or nil per share in the same period last year gold sales generated 6 34 million for the quarter compared to 5 53 million in the same period last year the

despite less gold being sold in the first quarter corporate expenses for the first quarter of 0 66 million increased by 0 17 million or 36 compared to 0 49 million in the same quarter last year the

assistance from dr amanda buckingham new high grade down plunge targets were defined at both burnakura and gabanintha and existing down plunge targets were refined by pit mapping and 3d structural analysis advanced geophysical filtering of gravity magnetic and electromagnetic data was undertaken and illustrates some of the key structures controlling the location of gold mineralization at the camp to district scale potential of large granitoid hosted gold systems at lewis reward and mt bowie prospects was highlighted in the study as well as potential for polymetallic vms systems along strike of the culculli and austin systems at burnakura the 3d structural targeting study identified 3 high priority down plunge targets the noa and alliance mineralization has been identified as having potential as an underground target mineralization at noa is hosted and controlled by northerly plunging folds work is being undertaken to identify further northerly plunging folds for potential repeats of the noa line of mineralization an exploration plan has been developed for both regional and underground potential at gabanintha the review and study of historical drilling data continued and highlighted that the mineralization is open at depth the 3d structural targeting study identified 3 high priority down plunge targets at gabanintha with the most promising target down plunge of

of a natural gas pipeline as part of china russia gas pipeline project in heihe heilongjiang by muyu xu chen aizhu and olesya astakhova harbin china singapore moscow reuters across china s coal burning northeastern provinces pipelines are being laid contracts signed and coal fired boilers ripped out ahead of the arrival next week of the country s first piped natural gas from russia the power of siberia pipeline due to open on dec 2 will pipe natural gas around 3 000 km 1 865 miles from russia s siberian fields to the fading industrial region which has lagged the push to gas in china s south and east advertisement advertisement the pipeline which will deliver gas under a 30 year 400 billion 312 billion deal signed in 2014 has the potential to transform northeast china s energy landscape and even slow the country s surging imports of liquefied natural gas lng it will also make russia a key supplier to china to rival turkmenistan and australia boosting ties amid beijing s trade war with the united states more immediately it poses a challenge for the sole marketer of the gas china national petroleum corp cnpc or petrochina as it looks to drum up demand in the relatively sparsely populated region that has relied on coal for heating during sub zero winters the pipeline will emerge in heilongjiang which borders russia and feed on to jilin and liaoning china s top grain hub where rust belt industries have long been overshadowed elsewhere the region s industry and 68 million city dwellers consume just 14 billion cubic meters bcm of gas a year well below the 38 bcm the pipeline will deliver at full capacity by 2025 russia s gazprom has said it expects to supply 4 6 bcm in 2020 rising to 10 bcm in 2021 16 bcm in 2022 21 bcm in 2023 and 25 bcm in 2024 graphic map of the power of siberia gas pipeline through china with local power prices capped by authorities to support manufacturing and cheaper imported coal available via liaoning s dalian port cnpc faces a tough task to sell gas it will take a long time to nurture a market in the northeast where gas fired power generation barely exists and the industrial sector is weak said li yao chief executive of consultancy sia energy with no take or pay contracts in place domestically cnpc shoulders most of the marketing risk price taker loss maker neither petrochina nor gazprom has revealed the gas pricing terms but beijing based analysts said the price is linked to crude oil or a basket of competing fuels ling xiao a petrochina vice president in charge of gas marketing said last month siberian supplies would be priced slightly lower than piped imports from turkmenistan but the company will still be making a loss as the price exceeds that of domestic city gate benchmark rates several russian gas industry sources said the pricing could be revised down as volumes increase due to a fall in global oil prices from around 100 a barrel when the deal was signed to around 60 now however the pricing formula remains known by only a few due to its commercial sensitivity according to one source gazprom said it will not comment on pricing story continues petrochina declined to comment on the pipeline or its plans to boost gas take up however the company which supplies 70 of china s gas has been working for the past five years to put distribution infrastructure in place a 3 371 km 2 095 mile trunkline linking the arrival point in heihe to shanghai is being laid in phases and slated for completion by 2024 state media reported petrochina completed a 728 km 452 mile section to changling in jilin province in july and slashed construction time on a short leg that will ensure gas to parts of north china this winter a 1 100 km extension to yongqing in hebei province is due by end 2020 petrochina has also made its first foray into regional midstream delivery between national pipelines and city networks building part of a planned heilongjiang grid connecting a dozen key cities caixin reported in november and the firm plans 5 6 bcm of underground storage to be built in depleted gas wells in daqing liaohe and jilin to cope with the off season demand trough said ding guosheng a gas storage expert with the company closer ties the pipeline will cement china s spot as russia s top export market and give russia a potentially enormous new market outside europe russian president vladimir putin has said trade between the neighbours would reach a record 100 billion this year up from 87 billion in 2018 moscow sees that figure rising to 200 billion by 2024 thanks in part to gas russia is leveraging well on china s trade war in the aftermath of western sanctions russia has turned to china and won investment markets and technology said professor feng yujun director of russia and central asia research at fudan university as beijing battles air pollution analysts at ihs market say china s gas demand is poised to surge by half between 2018 and 2025 at which point siberian gas is slated to supply a tenth of china s total gas demand graphic russia trade balance with china hits 13 year high as crude shipments scale new record if the northeast region is unable to absorb the full 38 bcm gas by 2025 some fuel will be diverted to north china where it could likely compete on cost against imported lng said jenny yang of ihs markit retail jostling meanwhile city gas distributors in heilongjiang such as china gas holdings and hongkong and china gas co ltd that provide last mile connections to users are eyeing a potential boon china gas has over the past 10 years spent more than 10 billion yuan 1 4 billion winning distribution licenses and laying pipelines in northeast region frank li assistant to president of china gas holdings told reuters now it s time to reap the fruits in heilongjiang s capital harbin the firm together with petrochina s kunlun energy is converting hundreds of heating stations centres that pipe hot water to nearby residents from coal to gas recent heavy snow pushed temperatures below freezing but workers are still racing to get ready for russian gas the pipelines are all settled and we are just waiting to connect them into our

for the last two years the trade conflict between the united states and china has dominated the economic and financial market debate with good reason after threats and accusations that long predated the 2016 us presidential election rhetoric has given way to action over the past 17 months the world s two largest economies have become embroiled in the most serious tariff war since the early 1930s and the weaponization of us trade policy to target perceived company specific threats such as chinese telecommunications equipment giant huawei has broadened the front in this battle from the start it has been a political conflict fought with economic weapons and could remain so in the foreseeable future what that means of course is that the economic and financial market outlook basically hinges on the political dynamics between the us and china has white house had enough of trade war in that vein the so called phase one skinny trade deal announced with great fanfare on oct 11 may be an important political signal while the deal if ever consummated will have next to no material economic impact it provides a strong hint that the white house has finally had enough of this trade war consumed by domestic political concerns especially impeachment hearings against the us president and the looming 2020 election it is in the white house s interest to declare victory and attempt to capitalize on it to counter the domestic problems china for its part would also like nothing more than to end the trade war politics may be very different in china but the chinese leadership is not about to capitulate on its core principles of sovereignty and its aspirational mid century goals of national rejuvenation growth and development at the same time there can be no mistaking downward pressures on the economy but with chinese policymakers determined to stay the course of their three year deleveraging campaign an important reason for the current slowdown they should be all the more eager to address the trade related pressures brought about by the us triggered trade war consequently the political calculus of both countries is coming into closer alignment with each looking for an end to the conflict there is always a risk that other complications will arise but at least for the time being the politics of the trade war are now pointing more toward de escalation rather than a renewed ratcheting up of tensions deglobalization can be ruled out if that is the case and if a phase one accord is reached it behoves us to ponder what the world will look like after the trade war several possibilities are at the top of my list deglobalization decoupling and trade diversion deglobalization is unlikely like the first wave of globalization that ended ignominiously between world war i and the great depression the current wave has generated a mounting backlash populism is rearing its ugly head around the world and tensions over income and wealth inequality aggravated by fears that technological innovations such as artificial intelligence will undermine job security are dominating the political discourse yet the climactic event that underscored the demise of the first wave of globalization was a 60 percent collapse in world trade in the early 1930s notwithstanding the current political dysfunction the odds of a similar outcome today are extremely low global decoupling too is unlikely reflecting the explosive growth in global value chains gvcs over the past 25 years the world is woven together more tightly than ever before that has transformed global competition away from the country specific paradigm of the past to a far more fragmented competition between widely distributed platforms of inputs components designs and assembly functions a recent international monetary fund study found that gvcs accounted for fully 73 percent of the rapid growth in global trade that occurred over the 20 year period from 1993 to 2013 enabled by irreversible trends of plunging transportation costs and technological breakthroughs in logistics and sourcing the gvc linkages that have come to underpin global economic integration are at little risk of decoupling us trade deficit shows domestic savings low trade diversion is a different matter altogether as i have long argued bilateral trade conflicts even bilateral decoupling can do nothing to resolve multilateral imbalances putting pressure on one of many trading partners precisely what the us is doing when it squeezes china in an effort to reduce its merchandise trade deficits with 102 countries is likely to backfire that s because america s multilateral trade deficit reflects a profound shortfall of domestic savings that will only get worse as the federal budget deficit now veers out of control so without addressing this chronic savings problem targeting china will mean pushing the chinese piece of the multilateral deficit on to the us other trading partners such diversion will shift trade to higher cost foreign sourcing the functional equivalent of a tax hike on us consumers trade truce or not a protracted economic struggle between the us and china has already begun a cease fire in the current battle could end up being a politically expedient pause in what is likely to be a long conflict which should worry the us which is devoid of a long term strategic framework china is not

devinder sharma food and agriculture specialist a new york farmer who also works as a lawyer tweeted this the other day headed home i tried to work in the law office today but my head is full of the disasters i am seeing on the dairy farms and in rural areas even longtime farmers in my area are trying to sell land to save the rest of the farm where is this headed i don t know well if such a deepening farm crisis should dominate one of the most productive agricultural systems in the world it s time to pause and rethink the question that needs to be asked is whether the us agricultural policy is deliberately aimed at decimating the farm sector and in that sense whether indian agriculture too is intentionally or unintentionally moving in that direction to say that the landholdings in india are too small to be economically viable is understandable but why is it that even in the united states where the average farm size is 444 acres small family farms should be on the way out why is that in australia where the average farm size is 4 331 hectares should agriculture become unviable going by the economy of scale there seems to be no plausible reason why farmers in america and australia should be quitting farming if small holdings are unviable how come even large holdings are becoming uneconomical unless of course policymakers refuse to admit that farmers everywhere in the world not only in india are being denied realtime prices depriving them of their rightful income first of all let s be clear the us has always been for pushing small farmers out of agriculture even at a time when us agriculture is passing through turbulent times american agriculture secretary sonny perdue unabashedly acknowledges in america the big get bigger and the small go out this echoes what former us agriculture secretary earl butz who served under presidents richard nixon and gerald ford had famously said get big or get out this was followed by a cleverly drafted narrative of feeding the world pushing farmers to produce large surpluses that actually dipped prices such a deliberate policy has left us small farmers struggling many of them are going out of business and quitting agriculture in desperation the policy to get big serves as an invitation for an increasing corporate control over agriculture which is also becoming an unwritten policy for the developing world to follow in addition whether it is the world trade organisation wto or the regional comprehensive economic partnership rcep treaty trade policies have been very conveniently tweaked to provide an enabling environment for big agribusiness giants to step in as competitiveness has become the market mantra developing as well as least developing countries are being increasingly forced to open up for cheaper agricultural products thereby displacing millions of small farmers in the bargain to illustrate the biggest dairy farm in china is spread over 22 500 000 acres an area equal to that of portugal according to worldatlas com this farm houses around 1 00 000 cows the second biggest dairy farm spread over 11 000 000 acres is also in china the remaining eight of the top 10 big dairy farms are situated in australia which despite the size are under stress no wonder the push for seeking an unfettered access into india through the regional mega rcep treaty which india has for the time being rightly decided to stay out of considering that 10 million people are involved in dairying in india imagine the destruction of livelihoods from cheaper dairy imports from australia new zealand and china returning to agriculture rural america like rural india is faced with a severe agrarian crisis like in india where the average income of farming families in 17 states which is roughly half the country stands at a paltry rs 20 000 a year the us agriculture is not doing good either more than half of us farmers have a negative income according to the american farm bureau federation 91 per cent farmers and farm workers face distress besides affecting their mental health the severity of the crisis is such that 87 per cent farmers fear they will have to abandon farming accordingly farm debt in 2019 is expected to soar to 416 billion the highest since 1980 for several decades farm gate prices have remained frozen when adjusted for inflation the prevailing onion prices for instance are no different from the prices farmers received 30 years ago corn prices have remained static for almost five decades if such a worsening farm crisis is happening in a country which applies state of the art technology in agriculture and is often touted as an example to be followed by the rest of the world isn t it time to examine how inappropriate is the argument for pushing in more sophisticated technology often unwanted in indian agriculture no one is against technology but it has to be relevant depending on the needs and not pushed to benefit commercial interests if in a country which is completely high tech in agriculture the suicide rate in rural areas is 45 per cent higher than in urban areas isn t it time to redesign indian agriculture focusing more on sustaining small farms thereby reducing the rural to urban migration shouldn t the ministry of agriculture and farmers welfare therefore embark on a fresh strategy to bring in policies tuned in more to domestic needs and those that make farming environmentally sustainable and economically viable an oecd icrier organisation for economic cooperation and development indian council for research on international economic relations study has shown that indian farmers have been suffering a loss of 14 per cent every year in farm incomes for almost two decades between 2000 01 and 2016 17 this has largely benefited the consumers who paid 25 per cent less for all agricultural commodities every year in other words it is the farmers who have been subsidising the country all these years an outcome of the global economic design which aims to deliberately keep farm prices low farmers anger is brewing across the world as farm protests spill on to the streets in germany holland canada america and india the reason for growing farm anger was best summed up by ian mclachlan president of the national farmers federation of australia who while addressing a farmers rally some years back had said we re sick and tired of subsidising the rest of australia
yves here note that the deterioration in subprime loan repayments is at odds with cheery stories at bloomberg like even low earners have money to spend by wolf richter editor of wolf street originally published at wolf street this is the transcript from my podcast last sunday the wolf street report ok we ve got a situation in subprime consumer loans the delinquency rate on credit card loan balances at the nearly 5 000 smaller commercial banks in the united states this means all banks except the largest 100 is blowing out according to federal reserve data in the third quarter the delinquency rate at these banks rose to 6 25 that s higher even than during the peak of the financial crisis back in 2016 the credit card delinquency rate at these banks was in the 3 range it has more than doubled in two years credit card balances are considered delinquent when they re 30 days or more past due this delinquency rate means that out of the banks total credit card balances 6 25 are 30 days or more past due this is a disturbingly large rate but delinquencies are a flow balances are removed from the delinquency basket either when the customer cures the delinquency such as catching up with past due payments or when the bank charges off the delinquent balance against its loan loss reserves but as these delinquent balances were taken out of the delinquency basket even more new delinquencies fell into the basket and the delinquency rate rose subprime auto loans have also been blowing out in the third quarter the serious delinquency rate of the 1 3 trillion in auto loans has risen to 4 71 the highest since the worst months of the financial crisis when the auto industry collapsed and when the us was facing the worst unemployment crisis since the great depression in the third quarter about 21 of all subprime auto loans were seriously delinquent meaning 90 days past due then we got another glimpse of this upheaval in subprime with some of the specialized lenders that cater to them for example world acceptance corp which does small short term consumer installment loans and some larger medium term loans to people who need money desperately and have subprime credit ratings like most specialized subprime lenders world acceptance charges blistering interest rates but then it also has large default rates it reported disappointing results now two quarters in a row and its shares have plunged 45 over the past four months so what s going on here back in 2009 people were defaulting on their auto loans and credit cards and their installment loans because over 10 million people had lost their jobs this is not the case today back then new unemployment claims a sign of layoffs spiked to astronomical levels these days they ve been hovering near historic lows so today these people are working and they re falling behind on their debt service subprime doesn t mean poor or uneducated subprime means having a credit score below 620 for example a family of two working adults and two kids the household income is 200 000 they bought a house and stretch to make the mortgage payments they bought nice cars and have to make payments their kids cost all kinds of money and it adds up and they re spending every dime they make then one of the earners gets seriously sick and can t work for a few months and the deductible on their health insurance is 4 500 and soon their six credit cards are maxed out so they go through daily triage about what to pay mortgage payments auto loan payments minimum payments on their maxed out credit cards groceries clothes for the kids bills gas and so on and they fall behind and late fees are racking up and their credit score drops below 620 and they re subprime they can still borrow and they can still get more credit cards but now under the terms of being subprime so banks take risks on credit cards because credit cards are immensely profitable until they re not credit cards unlike auto loans or mortgages are unsecured loans and recovery when the loan goes sour is small the bank may sell the delinquent credit card account to a debt collector for cents on the dollar and that s all it may get the hope is that income from interest and fees from other subprime credit cards that are still current are making up for the credit losses the whole thing is structured that way so the banks take big credit card risks for big profits and when the losses pile up at least at first they re just part of the cost of doing business the calculus works out in good times and snaps back in bad times we can use the nearly 5 000 smaller banks with their credit card delinquency rate of 6 25 as a stand in measure for subprime here is why the largest 100 banks have a delinquency rate of just 2 56 which remains low by historical standards and is just a small fraction of the peak delinquency rate during the financial crisis they can offer the most sophisticated incentives and marketing to attract the prime rated customers overall they have most of the customers and most of the credit card balances and they get the lion s share of prime customers they also go after subprime but since they have the lion s share of prime customers the portion of subprime customers don t weigh heavily in the mix but smaller banks can t offer the same kinds of incentives and marketing and often miss out on prime customers so proportionately they end up taking more subprime customers including those that were turned down by the largest banks and in this way they become a measure of subprime credit card delinquencies but why are credit card loans and auto loans and other risky consumer loans now running into this kind of turmoil when they hadn t in 2016 there is no employment crisis we haven t seen millions of people getting laid off but there is something else going on here i can see two factors one factor in the subprime turmoil is greed people with a subprime credit score know their credit score they know they re having trouble borrowing they ve been turned down they can t buy a car and finance it at the ultralow interest rates they see in ads because they don t qualify same with credit cards they tried to get the 2 cash back credit card with no annual fees and 7 9 apr and got turned down they re now conditioned to take whatever they can get in other words for the industry they ve become sitting ducks lenders offer them credit cards with the highest interest rates and the biggest fees auto dealers make big fat profits off these folks and specialized subprime lenders charge them dizzying interest rates to finance these cars that s all they can get no one forces these people to take those loans and credit cards but they re trying to maintain their lifestyle however basic it may already be and they re trying to feed their kids and drive them to school and so they borrow at these high rates to make ends meet but the high interest rates increase the probability of default because these people who are already strung out will have even greater trouble making the payments that part is driven by the industry s greed aggressive subprime lending went into overdrive starting in 2014 and private equity firms piled into it and smaller banks went after it and it s now coming home to roost the other factor in the subprime turmoil may well be something else something that would impact people the most who are already strung out people who have jobs but they re living from paycheck to paycheck and not necessarily because they re splurging but because at their level of the economy prices of goods and services they need have risen sharply and outpaced their incomes and this can happen overnight this includes healthcare costs and it includes food costs and apartment rentals and cars have gotten a lot more expensive and the like but cars and apartments and cellphones have gotten a lot better too and these quality improvements are added to the price think of the move over the years from a four speed automatic transmission to an eight speed automatic or from two airbags to 10 airbags or from a basic cellphone to a smartphone but for figuring the inflation measure of the consumer price index the costs of these quality improvements are removed from the index this is the principle of hedonic quality adjustments inflation measures the loss of purchasing power of the dollar what the same thing costs over time but when quality improves such as in a car it s no longer the same thing and the costs of those quality improvements are removed from the inflation index so the cpi for new cars has been essentially flat since 1995 meaning no inflation for 20 years when in reality the actual prices have jumped for example the price of a new toyota camry jumped by 25 between 1995 and 2019 with used cars it s even worse the cpi for used cars has declined by 11 since 1995 but actual used car prices have soared since then this goes for many other products and services across the spectrum and then consumers even when their income rises faster than inflation as measured by cpi run into this problem where their income no longer suffices to buy these goods and services including used cars and health care or housing because actual prices of these goods and services have far outpaced both inflation as measured by cpi and wage increases this goes increment by increment what might have worked last year suddenly doesn t work anymore this year these consumers with jobs that have been living from paycheck to paycheck suddenly find themselves confronted with a 20 increase in health insurance premium or a 10 increase in rent or both and suddenly their whole fragile equation doesn t compute anymore from one day to the next and they fall behind as more consumers are getting caught up in it subprime starts to blow out even in what are considered the good times because actual prices have outrun these people s incomes and they re confronted with it such as with rent or healthcare

hindsight is the very finest of qualities mused a philosophical paschal donohoe this week when asked about comments from a former german official suggesting ireland was hit with unnecessarily harsh austerity measures a decade ago at berlin s behest prof christian kastrop a former aide to wolfgang schäuble germany s federal finance minister in the aftermath of the bailout said they could have been more generous towards ireland in many cases without overdoing things donohoe the minister for finance was in the german capital to meet current federal finance minister olaf scholz as well as schäuble now president of the bundestag and new ecb chief christine lagarde as part of a bridge building exercise ahead of brexit it s fair to say donohoe was generous in his reply to kastrop s comments there was a huge amount of learning to be had on obligations facing programme countries a decade ago read more one of the lessons i have learned is to do all you can to avoid being in a situation where you are locked out of financial markets and where your economic sovereignty is compromised when you become that vulnerable all choices open to you are bad on that note the head of the banking lobby this week said bankers should not be put on the bold step for expressing views on regulatory or economic policy if irish society is to avoid repeating the mistakes of the financial crisis brian hayes chief executive of the banking payments federation ireland was referring to the drowning out of contrarian voices we need to be mature about this he said we live in a free society we should not be afraid of contrarian views of course the country could well find itself up the creek once again with or without the same mistakes the irish fiscal advisory council ifac warned this week that up to 6 billion or 60 per cent of the government s corporation tax windfall may be temporary business tax receipts rose to a record 10 4 billion last year more than double the amount collected in 2014 the jump has been linked to the on shoring of assets here in the wake of a global clampdown on multinational tax avoidance separately eu ministers blocked attempts by the european commission to require multinational companies to publicly report their tax payments country by country something which could dissuade companies from shifting profits to low tax areas corporation tax was on the table again at the american chamber of commerce ireland s annual thanksgiving lunch where taoiseach leo varadkar said a global agreement on tax must respect ireland s 12 5 per cent rate varadkar warned that a major shakeup of the global tax system which currently allows companies book profits in low tax jurisdictions such as ireland to minimise their tax bills was inevitable intel clears planning hurdle chip manufacturer intel cleared a major hurdle in its proposed 3 6 billion investment at its leixlip campus this week which should pave the way for one of the largest single private investments in the history of the state the company which is looking to build a new manufacturing facility got the green light from an bord pleanála and while the ruling is open to judicial review it is now likely to go ahead thomas reid the farmer who successfully sued the state over an attempt to compulsorily purchase his land and serial litigator peter sweetman are both understood to be considering a judicial review of the decision it was a bad week for niall mcgarry the founder and majority shareholder of digital publisher maximum media after he confirmed he has stepped away from executive involvement in the irish side of the business mcgarry told the irish times he will focus instead on its business in the uk where it launched with its joe digital platform in 2015 he said he will work in conjunction with the existing management team in the uk mcgarry s decision came after media agency core pulled its campaigns with the publishing group over concerns that traffic numbers for a 2017 podcast were artificially boosted by a so called click farm mcgarry said that in light of the controversy this is what needed to happen he also said he believed that his personal brand was overshadowing the business it was also a bad week for a slightly bigger fish as businessman denis o brien faced questions over whether he will inject equity into digicel his telecoms business that operates in 32 markets under an expected debt restructuring next year o brien extracted at least 1 9 billion 1 7 billion of dividends from digicel between 2007 and 2014 but refused calls from digicel bondholders to commit cash to the group last year as it went about restructuring almost 3 billion of borrowings elsewhere stripe the fast growing online payments firm established by limerick brothers patrick and john collison saw revenues jump by nearly 80 per cent to 528 7 million 480 million at its dublin headquartered subsidiary last year climate impacting on business the impact of climate change on business and the economy could be seen again this week as economist colm mccarthy warned we could be facing a rise of up to 30 per cent in air fares that would be on the back of mooted eu tax increases such as a levy on jet fuel and the application of vat on airline tickets although no concrete proposals exist yet however mccarthy who is also a director of the state airports company daa told a tourism industry conference that the european commission wants to hit jet kerosene with a 33 cent a litre carbon tax the republic stopped taxing air travel in 2013 so customers would feel the full impact of vat should it be imposed most other eu states charge airline passengers in some way or other ryanair said it is opposed to any taxes given that it will spend 630 million this year on environmental taxes while the state said it would engage constructively in negotiations surrounding proposals finally convenience food giant greencore pledged to make 100 per cent of its packaging sustainable by 2025 in a bid to address its waste footprint the move would reduce its reliance on virgin plastic by several hundred tonnes a year

photo credit alamy stock photo as millennials approach their prime earning years they face unique financial challenges they are grappling with a combination of mounting student loan debt increased housing costs and lingering effects of the great recession despite higher levels of education millennials are more likely to have lower earnings fewer assets and less wealth than previous generations at the same age millennials recently surpassed baby boomers to become the country s largest generation and more of these financially burdened young adults are settling down to start families in fact over 17 million millennial women are now mothers and they currently account for the overwhelming majority of births in the u s given the typical full time millennial worker earns around 40 000 per year it s fitting that young millennial families increasingly seek alternatives to big city life leaving high priced coastal cities in favor of more affordable cities or suburbs of course while popular large cities come with steep price tags they also offer some of the best wages and job opportunities fortunately after taking cost of living into account a diverse set of metropolitan areas in terms of both location and size offer highly competitive salaries for young workers to identify the best paying cities for millennials researchers at fabric a brooklyn based startup helping families plan for their financial future analyzed the latest data from the u s census bureau only metropolitan areas with at least 100 000 people were included in order to make wages comparable across locations dollar amounts for each metro were adjusted up or down based on the relative cost of living in highly expensive cities such as san francisco earnings were adjusted down in more affordable cities like birmingham earnings were adjusted up across the entire u s the median annual earnings for full time millennial workers in 2018 was 40 000 so in the data below if adjusted earnings are above 40 000 then millennials in that city tend to experience above average purchasing power fabric s researchers started by identifying the small and midsize metros with the highest cost of living adjusted earnings for full time millennial workers then they crunched the numbers to identify the 15 best paying large metropolitan areas fabric included wage data for all workers population growth and median home prices from zillow they looked at population growth to see whether more affordable cities were growing at a faster rate than others and they looked at home prices as another measure of relative affordability here s what they found
for the last two years the trade conflict between the united states and china has dominated the economic and financial market debate with good reason after threats and accusations that long predated the 2016 us presidential election rhetoric has given way to action over the past 17 months the world s two largest economies have become embroiled in the most serious tariff war since the early 1930s and the weaponization of us trade policy to target perceived company specific threats such as chinese telecommunications equipment giant huawei has broadened the front in this battle from the start it has been a political conflict fought with economic weapons and could remain so in the foreseeable future what that means of course is that the economic and financial market outlook basically hinges on the political dynamics between the us and china has white house had enough of trade war in that vein the so called phase one skinny trade deal announced with great fanfare on oct 11 may be an important political signal while the deal if ever consummated will have next to no material economic impact it provides a strong hint that the white house has finally had enough of this trade war consumed by domestic political concerns especially impeachment hearings against the us president and the looming 2020 election it is in the white house s interest to declare victory and attempt to capitalize on it to counter the domestic problems china for its part would also like nothing more than to end the trade war politics may be very different in china but the chinese leadership is not about to capitulate on its core principles of sovereignty and its aspirational mid century goals of national rejuvenation growth and development at the same time there can be no mistaking downward pressures on the economy but with chinese policymakers determined to stay the course of their three year deleveraging campaign an important reason for the current slowdown they should be all the more eager to address the trade related pressures brought about by the us triggered trade war consequently the political calculus of both countries is coming into closer alignment with each looking for an end to the conflict there is always a risk that other complications will arise but at least for the time being the politics of the trade war are now pointing more toward de escalation rather than a renewed ratcheting up of tensions deglobalization can be ruled out if that is the case and if a phase one accord is reached it behoves us to ponder what the world will look like after the trade war several possibilities are at the top of my list deglobalization decoupling and trade diversion deglobalization is unlikely like the first wave of globalization that ended ignominiously between world war i and the great depression the current wave has generated a mounting backlash populism is rearing its ugly head around the world and tensions over income and wealth inequality aggravated by fears that technological innovations such as artificial intelligence will undermine job security are dominating the political discourse yet the climactic event that underscored the demise of the first wave of globalization was a 60 percent collapse in world trade in the early 1930s notwithstanding the current political dysfunction the odds of a similar outcome today are extremely low global decoupling too is unlikely reflecting the explosive growth in global value chains gvcs over the past 25 years the world is woven together more tightly than ever before that has transformed global competition away from the country specific paradigm of the past to a far more fragmented competition between widely distributed platforms of inputs components designs and assembly functions a recent international monetary fund study found that gvcs accounted for fully 73 percent of the rapid growth in global trade that occurred over the 20 year period from 1993 to 2013 enabled by irreversible trends of plunging transportation costs and technological breakthroughs in logistics and sourcing the gvc linkages that have come to underpin global economic integration are at little risk of decoupling us trade deficit shows domestic savings low trade diversion is a different matter altogether as i have long argued bilateral trade conflicts even bilateral decoupling can do nothing to resolve multilateral imbalances putting pressure on one of many trading partners precisely what the us is doing when it squeezes china in an effort to reduce its merchandise trade deficits with 102 countries is likely to backfire that s because america s multilateral trade deficit reflects a profound shortfall of domestic savings that will only get worse as the federal budget deficit now veers out of control so without addressing this chronic savings problem targeting china will mean pushing the chinese piece of the multilateral deficit on to the us other trading partners such diversion will shift trade to higher cost foreign sourcing the functional equivalent of a tax hike on us consumers trade truce or not a protracted economic struggle between the us and china has already begun a cease fire in the current battle could end up being a politically expedient pause in what is likely to be a long conflict which should worry the us which is devoid of a long term strategic framework china is not

luis lacalle pou of the centre right partido nacional won uruguay s presidency after his rival conceded four days after a extremely tight run off election lacalle pou a career politician and son of a former president was congratulated by his opponent daniel martínez of the ruling frente amplio ending 15 years in power for the left wing coalition the evolution of the vote count hasn t changed the trend martínez wrote on twitter we greet presidentelect luis lacalle pou with whom i will have a meeting tomorrow i thank everyone who placed their trust in us by casting their vote for us from the bottom of my heart martínez had refused to concede on sunday when the election was deemed too close to call by the electoral court with just 30 000 votes separating the candidates the court ordered a recount on the grounds that the number of provisional or contested votes around 35 000 exceeded the margin between the candidates the court has not yet published its final results the partido nacional acknowledged victory in a tweet saying now it s our turn let s celebrate everybody s uruguay the news set off a cacophony of horn blowing in downtown montevideo by lacalle pou supporters lacalle pou and martínez were scheduled to meet at the president elect s campaign headquarters yesterday speaking with reporters vice president elect beatriz argimón said she will meet with vice president lucia topolansky next tuesday to discuss the transition swinging right one of south america s wealthiest nations uruguay had already started its swing to the right in the october 27 general elections that saw the frente amplio lose control of congress for the first time since 2005 lacalle pou s victory is part of a recent anti incumbent backlash in the region that has seen latin americans vote for change whether it be from the right or the left it also comes at a time of increased volatility in south america with violent protests erupting in colombia ecuador bolivia and chile the result in uruguay means that the right will govern in three of the four countries that constitute the south american trading bloc known as mercosur that could leave alberto fernández argentina s president elect isolated when he takes office next month the bloc is already under strain following comments from president jair bolsonaro casting doubt on whether brazil will even stay in mercosur bolsonaro called lacalle pou to congratulate him according to a statement from brazil s foreign ministry uruguay can t afford to lose its mercosur export market if the bloc collapses but at the same time it needs mercosur to negotiate more trade deals with the rest of the world ignacio bartesaghi dean of the c a t h o l i c u n i v e r s i t y o f uruguay s business sciences school said in an interview when there are two playerslike argentina and brazil with so much weight and two presidents that are so far apart like fernandez and bolsonaro it s uruguay that can mediate he said argentina needs an ally to prevent bolsonaro s extreme position becoming reality sputtering economy the 46 year old former lawmaker and heir to one of uruguay s oldest political dynasties will start his five year term on march 1 as the head of a broad five party multicolour coalition spanning the centreleft to the far right the grouping will have ample majorities in both houses of congress lacalle pou who has already named three ministers including former debt management director azucena arbeleche as his finance minister said he will fill the rest of his cabinet by mid december ernesto talvi leader of the colorado party is expected to be named uruguay s foreign minister uruguay s el país daily reported the new government will inherit an economy on a slightly stronger footing thanks to outgoing president tabaré vázquez s efforts to secure us 5 billion of investment in public works and the construction of a massive pulp mill economists surveyed by bloomberg forecast growth of 1 5 percent next year and two percent in 2021 compared with 0 3 percent this year still uruguay s economy will face headwinds from its two much larger neighbours with argentina s economic crisis likely to continue and brazil s recovery slow according to james bosworth s latin america risk report cutting a public sector deficit approaching five percent of gdp to protect uruguay s access to cheap credit is a key part of lacalle pou s policy programme which includes potentially contentious social security and public education reforms his advisers have promised to reduce wasteful spending by us 900 million in 2020 alone regional unrest and his narrow victory might prompt lacalle pou to adopt a more gradual fiscal adjustment said aldo lema an economist and partner at vixion consultores in opposition the frente amplio will also have an incentive to foster political stability as it eyes a return to power in 2025 he said but lema noted that uruguay is far from immune to the unrest roiling the region responsible opposition the frente amplio remains the country s largest political party with the ability to draw thousands of supporters onto the streets lacalle pou will also have to reach an understanding with militant trade unions organized under the umbrella of the powerful pitcnt labour confederation frente amplio party chairman javier miranda told reporters monday that his party will be a responsible opposition that will defend the achievements of its 15 years in power the party would also accept lacalle pou s offer to place its representatives on the boards of state run companies and other government entities he added
getty once again the cdc has released figures on the fertility rate in the united states once again the figures show an all time low in may the cdc released its provisional 2018 rates with a total fertility rate of 1 728 births per woman on wednesday the cdc released its final rate at 1 730 a decline from 1 766 in 2017 and 1 821 in 2016 that puts it at an all time low slightly below its 1976 trough of 1 738 explanations abound for the drop in fertility rates in the early post recession years the answer was simply it s cyclical and that was reasonable enough after its prior low in the 70s and early 80s the rate recovered then dipped with the recession of the early 90s before climbing again this is plain to see visually using world bank and cdc data us fertility rates 1971 2018 who and cdc data postponing children in a time of economic uncertainty makes sense although a study at the center for retirement research attributes the recent decline to a host of other long term factors including declines in religious affiliation the increasing opportunity cost as the gap between men s and women s wages narrows and the impact of changing immigration patterns at the same time the demographer lyman stone offers an alternate explanation it s not about childbearing in isolation but about marriage despite the worries about nonmarital childbearing it is due to the postponement of marriage that americans are having fewer children and this isn t merely speculation it s based on the math of differing fertility rates by marital status and changing marriage patterns over time honestly this narrative isn t quite convincing when it s told in terms of college educated young adults postponing marriage and family yes it is true that the generation x middle class was more likely to marry in their late 20s and have children in their early 30s and the millennial middle class is more likely to marry in their early 30s and have children in their late 30s but the drops in childbearing have been at significantly younger ages and are not being made up for by meaningful increases later here s a comparison table looking at 2007 the peak year vs 2018 by age fertility trends by age compiled using cdc data but it doesn t really make sense to construct a narrative of fertility decline based on changes in middle class norms when it s not the middle class having most of the babies in a 2017 research brief researchers w bradford wilcox and wendy wang calculated total fertility rates by class for the middle and upper class 1 7 children per women for the working class 1 8 for the poor 2 4 among teens there has certainly been a heavy push towards the use of larcs long acting reversible contraceptives that is implants and iuds but what of women in their 20s at the same time in that same research brief wilcox and wang document the dramatic class divide in marriage according to the 2015 american community survey 56 of middle upper class adults ages 18 55 were married but only 39 of the same aged working class and 26 of the poor poor they define as income below the 20th percentile or high school drop outs working class are those with income between the 20th and 50th percentile who do not have a bachelor s degree and middle upper class are the rest what s more this marriage divide is not longstanding but comparatively new though they cannot split out older data in quite the same way they are able to provide historical data by education status here s their chart for those aged 25 55 marriage rates by education from the marriage divide so what does this mean it certainly suggests that hand wringing that student loan debt to take one example is causing depressed fertility is misguided but that this is an issue that has a lot more to do with the troubles that the working class face which have not been resolved despite the long ago ended recession all of which means that we still simply don t know what the fertility rate will look like in the future whether at some point we will finally reach some new stable level or whether like finland where the tfr dropped from 1 87 in 2010 to 1 35 in 2019 it will continue to collapse and reach levels never envisioned in the u s what do you think you re invited to comment at janetheactuary com
