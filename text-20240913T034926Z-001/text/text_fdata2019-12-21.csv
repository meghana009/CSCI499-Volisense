the perspective atlanta georgia december 21 2019 in a communication dated december 15 2019 president weah stressed the increasing liquidity needs of the economy informing the senate that the current liquidity projection of the cbl compared with a very low liberian dollars vault cash position of both the cbl and commercial banks makes it imperative to infuse additional banknotes to ease the liquidity pressure as a short term measure president weah intimated we are aware of that the legislature is currently deliberating pressing national issues including finalizing deliberations on authorization of the cbl to print a new set of liberian dollar banknotes the existing situation presents a volatile financial environment such that the current liberian dollar vault cash position with the cbl is very inadequate to meet both current and future liberian dollar liquidity demand of commercial banks posing a potential security risk therefore based on the fact that there exists high pressure on the volume of currency in circulation i request the legislature in accordance with article 34 d of the constitution of liberia to authorize the central bank of liberia to print and infuse l 4 0 billion of the present currency to ease the current liquidity pressure i trust that the legislature will respond in a timely manner in the interest of our nation and its people critics of the weah s administration like representative yekeh and others have revealed the weah s administration printed the banknotes already and was seeking authorization to release the newly printed banknotes into the economy as he did not follow protocol greeting legislative approval first on december 18 2019 the legislature has approved president george weah s request to print l 4 billion for infusion into the economy even though the liberian senate approved the printing of ld 4 billion arguably the fundamentals are definitely not right to print money in liberia liberia s high public debt levels sustained average fiscal deficit in the last 3 years current account deficit and low international bank balances are factors that would militate against the latest currency print by the weah s administration our central bank must address the exchange rate disparities between the us dollar and the liberian dollars and tackle the possibility of hyperinflation in the economy before printing more money what do i mean in september 2018 local media reported that shipping containers filled with newly printed liberian dollars from swedish banknote manufacturer crane ab disappeared from liberia s entry ports between 2016 and 2017 the central bank of liberia denied the allegations and stated that the money was stored in vaults across the city two reports were commissioned to examine the details the government s presidential investigative team pit completed one risk advisory firm kroll the other both found major flaws in how government policy was implemented in each case and neither the pit nor kroll was able to account for all of the newly printed liberian dollars or the additional us dollars in the country according to kroll only l 5bn of the total l 15 5bn was printed and distributed in line with liberian law the central bank did not receive legislative approval for the remainder of the cash but entered into another contract with crane who proceeded to print and deliver the money to liberia anyway kroll also found an excess of l 2 6bn was printed in addition to what was initially disclosed the pit s report recorded a similar finding just a few months before the 16 billion revelations president george weah announced that the central bank would pump 25m into the economy to replace older liberian dollars weah s technical economic management team temt argues that the liberian dollar has been losing value or depreciating since july 2017 this has led to higher import costs and inflation which means that everyday goods have become much more expensive for the average person in the country the president s mop up exercise as it was dubbed took place between july and october last year it was intended to reduce the amount of local currency in the economy to slow further depreciation the general auditing commission s forensic investigation has revealed that us 2 378 187 00 has not been properly accounted for during the us 25 million mop up exercises conducted by the country s technical economic management team temt under the signature of auditor general yusador gaye revealed that us 491 769 00 was spent on 15 entities which the central bank of liberia cbl claimed to have participated in the mop up exercise however those entities denied participation in the process also the report said that per cbl records 27 entities received us 702 680 00 during the mop up exercise but none of them were registered as per document review from the liberia business registry records the report also said that 52 entities per the cbl record received us 1 092 292 00 but did not answer or reply to telephone calls or text messages from gac auditors further the gac report explained that 8 entities that received us 163 446 00 during the mop up exercise per cbl records were not in operation during the field visit a leaked letter written to president weah and signed by nine ambassadors european union us uk france germany ireland japan norway and sweden put the spotlight on how the weah s administration had withdrawn donor aid kept in accounts at liberia s central bank without their authorization according to the minister of information as part of the money was used for salary payment because people had to be paid for christmas and new year and the government had some shortcomings and the government was in the process of returning the money before this communication came the world bank wrote finance minister samuel tweah in march of 2019 to repay the amount of us 3 285 750 of ineligible expenditures back to the bank s account the money according to the bank includes us 35 750 worth of stolen laptops and unapproved debit of us 2 million both from the ebola emergency response project while the rest came from other unapproved debits from the liberia social safety nets project under the ministry of health us 500 000 public sector modernization project us 500 000 liberia forest sector project under the fda us 200 000 and the liberia urban water supply project us 50 000 liberia s empty vaults hold a fundamental lesson for money to work people have to trust in it and the liberian government under the leadership of george weah has repeatedly betrayed the people s confidence through gross fiscal and monetary mismanagement for liberians the most striking manifestation are civil servants haven t taken pay for over 6 months inflicted prices of core commodities medicines and pharmaceuticals most of which are imported are in short supply and only at exorbitant prices with coupled with rising inflation a shortage of trust means a shortage of money and a shortage of money means a shortage of everything else in an op ed in the new york times george weah penned don t forget about liberia liberia is open for business liberia is open for business has been the weah administration s battle cry but the compounding political and economic crises mean that the public is unwilling to trust a new dispensation that is so closely intertwined with the old arcelormittal liberia has threatened to halt phase two of its investment in liberia on suspicion that its concession area at the port of buchanan is being encroached on with the endorsement of the government of liberia through a deal with prista port the company s objection to a concession agreement entered into by the national port of authority representing the government of liberia and prista port buchanan llc on grounds that it includes and overlaps a majority of the current concession area of arcelormittal liberia in buchanan grand bassa county no one thought rebuilding the country s economy would be easy but weah and his policymakers seem confounded every time a finance minister appears in public to explain the situation and offer a solution things get worse samuel tweah who is an executive of weah s congress for democratic change cdc and was appointed finance minister is already on being heavily criticized with some calling for his dismissal for the dismayed performance of the liberian economy during a recent radio interview he sounded frustrated and short tempered those are not the issues and i don t want to get stuck on those issues he snapped at the radio presenter refusing to answer her sharp questions about taxation shortfalls and inflation tweah s dismissiveness echoes the general state of denial in liberia s government after months of government tinkering with the money supply people no longer trust in the bank sector including donors ordinary people who don t have access to banking or mobile money struggle in a world with no cash or where the value of their cash can be wiped clean at a moment s notice the inequality is stark in liberia people who have access to us dollars are simply getting more for their money than those who don t where are people who have no access to relatives or trading partners abroad or to us dollar denominated accounts supposed to find them how can they keep up arguably money in liberia is barely performing the core functions of money perversely the lack of trust in government reminds us that banking is just an idea while people are real the lack of trust of the weah s administration from citizen oscillating wildly but liberian are still eking out an existence despite the hardship dealing with each other out of the banking sector and other systems that pare down trust to its fundamentals i see you i know you i trust you perversely this crisis may accelerate liberia s worsening economic woes to a more complex one much of the suffering currently inflicted on ordinary liberian right now is unnecessary a symptom of a weah s administration that has taken the loyalty and trust of its citizens for granted weah s administration can t keep printing money to cover her spiraling cost and inflation is rising what his administration is lacking is the understanding that printing more money won t equate to an increase in productivity in the liberian economy since there is little new investment to create new goods so in effect you will have more money chasing the same goods in other words you needed more dollars to buy the same stuff as before and prices will rise drastically this happened recently in zimbabwe in africa and in venezuela in south america when these countries printed more money to try to make their economies grow as the printing presses sped up prices rose faster until these countries started to suffer from something called hyperinflation that s when prices rise by an amazing amount in a year what is needed is public trust according to the organization for economic co operation and development oecd public trust in government has been identified as one of the most important foundations upon which the legitimacy and sustainability of political systems are built trust is essential for social cohesion and well being as it affects governments ability to govern and enables them to act without having to resort to coercion consequently it is an efficient means of lowering transaction costs in any social economic and political relationship fukuyama 1995 a high level of trust in government might increase the efficiency and effectiveness of government operations rebuilding public trust won t come from ever more complex financial policies printing ld 4 billion to pay civil servants as argued by cdc executive and member of the national legislature acarous gray on facebook or liberia s security forces launching a violent crackdown on december 30 2019 mass citizens protest or crackdown done under the cover of a social media blackout or outright denials by members of weah s administration it will start with something as simple as the government finally telling the truth respect for the rule of law forging for government effectiveness control of corruption promoting voice and accountability regulatory quality political stability and absence of violence seltue karweaye m s m p a m b a the

u s review expansion poised to continue into the next decade president trump became the third president in u s history to be impeached by the house but removal by the senate is highly unlikely the house also passed the usmca which should be signed into law in early 2020 this along with the phase one deal announced last friday should remove some uncertainty as we head into the new year boeing announced it is halting production of the 737 max we estimate this will drag 0 5 points off q1 gdp growth november industrial production jumped but it was largely due to gm resuming production post strike residential activity continues to post solid gains expansion poised to continue into the next decade a relatively quiet week for hard economic data was nonetheless full of new developments first president trump became the third president in u s history to be impeached after the house voted 230 197 and 229 198 along strictly partisan lines to charge him with abuse of power and obstruction of congress despite the historic nature of the vote there was negligible reaction from financial markets trump joins bill clinton 1998 and andrew johnson 1868 as impeached presidents but like both of them he will most likely not be removed from office as the republican controlled senate has shown no signs of breaking rank the economic impact should thus be small to none modestly positive however in the form of lower trade policy uncertainty is the progress on the usmca trade agreement one day after voting to impeach the house agreed overwhelmingly to approve the trade pact which is expected to be passed by the senate and signed into law early next year second boeing announced on monday it would halt production of the 737 max which it was currently producing at a rate of 42 per month but not shipping we estimate the suspension of production will reduce q1 gdp growth by as much as 0 5 percentage points with hits to manufacturing output inventories building and eventually to payrolls up and down the supply chain for more on when we expect a rebound see topic of the week we will be closely watching the industrial production data which showed a 1 1 jump in november the highest since october 2017 this was due almost entirely to the 12 4 surge in motor vehicles parts output as striking gm employees returned to work during the month with troubles at two of america s manufacturing giants injecting idiosyncrasies into the month to month data it can be easy to lose the forest for the trees stepping back however what s clear is the factory sector has moved sideways this past year output is down 0 7 under the cloud of trade uncertainty third the agreement on the phase one trade deal between the united states and china which was announced by the u s trade representative last friday lifts some of that uncertainty moreover the nascent rebound in the ism signals coming improvement for manufacturing top chart still we do not have perfect clarity on the deal for example is china really going to buy 50 billion of u s agricultural products annually when it has never purchased even 25 billion in a year even before the trade war started nevertheless the lowering of tariffs and rhetoric should improve the economic environment and is why we changed our forecast this week and now have the fed on hold in 2020 outside of washington d c and seattle main street and the housing sector are picking up benefiting from the sizable move down in interest rates this past year the nahb index soared five points to 76 the highest since 1999 and housing starts followed suit climbing 3 2 in november middle chart existing home sales disappointed with a 1 7 drop but surging builder optimism sustained low rates and solid consumer fundamentals personal income rose 0 5 in november while personal spending rose 0 4 bottom chart should drive housing higher in 2020 u s outlook new home sales december 23 despite slipping in october new home sales have been on a tear recently averaging their fastest three month pace of this expansion three quarter point rate cuts by the fomc over the second half of the year helped ease borrowing costs for builders potential home buyers have also enjoyed cheaper financing which along with a resilient labor market and changing demographics has supported demand for new homes for the first time in a few years it appears the housing market has the wind at its back and we expect these dynamics will support continued improvement in the housing market going into 2020 as for the penultimate month of the decade existing home sales took a step back but surging builder optimism suggests to us that the pace of new home sales increased marginally in november previous 733k wells fargo 734k consensus 730k durable goods december 23 the october durable goods report showed signs of stabilization in the manufacturing sector following a rough few months core capital goods orders which rose 1 1 suggested that the rebound was more than just a one off but continued weakness in the survey measures suggests that any rebound in the industrial sector is likely to be muted looking to the november report the resolution of the gm strike means we should be due for some bounce back in motor vehicle parts orders in november motor vehicles parts orders declined 2 in october following a 2 9 decline the month prior by our calculations a full rebound in orders for this category would add a little more than a percentage point to the headline figure but with activity remaining under pressure outside the auto sector we are looking for just a 1 3 increase in durable goods and a 0 2 increase in durables ex transportation previous 0 5 wells fargo 1 3 consensus 1 5 month over month consumer confidence december 31 the conference board s consumer confidence index fell for the fourth straight month in november to 125 5 driven by a 6 6 point drop in consumers assessment of current business and labor market conditions this streak of declines could turn around following the de escalation of trade tensions and subsequent stock market rally however the full effect of a u s china ceasefire might not be realized yet given that the agreement and its effect on sentiment took place toward the end of the board s survey period even still our above consensus call looks for the index to recoup more than its losses over the last three months more broadly we anticipate that consumer confidence will remain in the elevated range that it has maintained over the past two years while economic and political uncertainty continues to weigh on the economy employment gains should give consumers plenty of reason to remain upbeat previous 125 5 wells fargo 129 4 consensus 128 0 global review chinese data better eurozone mixed banxico cuts the international economic data started the week on a positive note as data out of china showed a broadly encouraging picture for november the preliminary eurozone pmis for december were more mixed the manufacturing sector pmi gave back november s gain but the service sector pmi resiliently remained in expansionary territory both the bank of england and bank of mexico met this week with the former keeping rates steady and the latter cutting its main policy rate 25 bps the fourth time it has done so this year chinese data better eurozone mixed banxico cuts the international economic data started the week on a positive note as data out of china showed a broadly encouraging picture for november chinese retail sales accelerated to their fastest pace since june as did industrial production see chart on front page this was an especially encouraging string of prints as the recent détente in u s china relations offer some reason to believe that the november momentum might be carried into 2020 we published a report earlier this week arguing that the recent performance of some china dependent economies suggests the world s second largest economy may be starting to stabilize and this week s data provide further evidence for this view the preliminary eurozone pmis for december were more mixed the manufacturing pmi gave back the one point gain seen in november returning to its october level of 45 9 top chart with this print the eurozone manufacturing pmi spent 11 of the 12 months in 2019 below the 50 line that demarcates expansion from contraction thus the theme of weak manufacturing in europe appears to have remained in place to finish the year yet the other major theme of service sector divergence also appears to have remained in place as the eurozone services pmi rose half a point to 52 4 despite the manufacturing sector s troubles the service sector has remained resilient and at no point has it fallen below 51 2 this year yet another quarter of relatively weak but positive growth appears likely for the eurozone in q4 2019 the bank of england boe met this week on the heels of the u k general election that gave boris johnson s conservative party a majority in parliament the central bank chose to hold its policy rate steady and noted in its statement that gdp growth was projected to pick up from current below potential rates supported by the reduction of brexit related uncertainties an easing of fiscal policy and a modest recovery in global growth interestingly the boe argues that continued strong pay growth and relatively weak productivity growth point to unit labor cost growth that is consistent with inflation above target over the medium term in the near term the ongoing strength in the pound is likely to keep a lid on inflation which has retreated from nearly 3 over the past year or so middle chart we do not expect the boe to hike or cut rates in 2020 the bank of mexico also met this week and chose to once again cut rates 25 bps since the start of the year the central bank has cut its main policy rate 100 bps bottom chart amid an environment of slowing inflation and real gdp growth that is 0 3 year over year at present the anticipated passage of the usmca should be a net positive for the mexican economy and the peso which has appreciated more than 3 against the dollar since december 2 a stronger peso should give the central bank the confidence to continue easing monetary policy which in turn should provide a much needed boost to the mexican economy downside risks remain present however as the credit rating outlook for pemex and mexico s sovereign debt outlook remains challenging global outlook japan industrial production december 26 industrial production plunged in japan in october falling 4 5 in the month which was the largest monthly decline since the 2011 earthquake and tsunami october s print was also impacted by natural disasters namely the typhoon that hit japan that month the increase in japan s value added tax rate on october 1 may also have temporarily dampened demand and by extension output for durable goods thus we doubt the state of the japanese factory sector is nearly as bad as the recent data would suggest in a statement released at the conclusion of this week the bank of japan noted the slowdown in industrial production but pointed to an increasing trend in business fixed investment and corporate profits at high levels as reasons not to be too concerned gross fixed capital formation rose 4 9 year over year in q3 2019 which given the ongoing global growth challenges and perennially weak economic growth in japan is a reasonably strong reading previous 4 5 consensus 1 1 month over month south korea industrial production dec 29 industrial production growth in korea has been on a steady downward slide since the end of 2018 through october industrial output fell 2 6 year over year interestingly the magnitude of this industrial slowing quite closely mirrors the one that occurred in 2015 left chart when fears about a significant slowdown in the global economy generally and china specifically were swirling as they have been for the past several months this week we published an update to our june report on how china dependent economies are performing in the most recent report we highlighted that there are signs of a near term stabilization in these economies which bodes well for the global outlook given that 13 of south korean output can be attributed to foreign final demand in china the fifth highest share in the world a turnaround in industrial production over the next few months would be a telling sign that this stabilization is indeed occurring in china previous 1 7 consensus 0 7 month over month russia q3 gdp december 30 on december 30 we will receive the second look at q3 real gdp growth in russia as well as a detailed breakdown by expenditure real gdp growth in russia had been on a slide through the first half of the year and was beginning to flirt with a dip below zero but a turnaround in q3 appears to have stabilized things the sources of this turnaround will be important household consumption growth was actually a solid 2 8 year over year in q2 with most of that quarter s weakness coming from exports government consumption and gross fixed capital formation if export growth and or investment growth strengthened alongside the household sector this would be an encouraging sign that domestic demand is still healthy in russia the effects of easier monetary policy and a stronger currency are likely helping the central bank has managed to cut its policy rate 150 bps this year and yet the ruble has still managed to strengthen 7 5 year over year against the dollar previous 1 7 year over year point of view interest rate watch change to fomc outlook this week we needed to follow the old dictum which is widely if perhaps inaccurately attributed to john maynard keynes that when the facts change we change our minds specifically we had been looking for the federal open market committee fomc to cut its target range for the fed funds rate another 25 bps in early 2020 but as we described in more detail in a recent report we now expect that the fomc will keep its target range unchanged at 1 50 to 1 75 through the end of 2021 top chart our old forecast was predicated on our assumption that the 15 tariff on chinese goods that was to take effect on december 15 would do so as scheduled because financial markets did not seem to be priced for another episode of tariff hikes we surmised that stock markets would weaken and credit spreads would widen when the tariffs went into effect in our view the fomc would want to offset this tightening in financial market conditions at least in part with another rate cut in the event however american and chinese negotiators reached agreement on december 12 on the outlines of a phase one trade deal because financial conditions have not tightened it does not seem likely now that the fomc will ease policy further but if our forecast of real gdp growth of roughly 2 per annum throughout 2020 and 2021 proves to be reasonably accurate middle chart then the committee likely will not raise rates either at least not anytime soon in our view u s economic growth would need to be significantly stronger and or inflation meaningfully higher than its present rate of roughly 2 for the fomc to hike rates although the fed likely will be on hold we forecast that long term interest rates will drift slowly higher in coming quarters bottom chart as uncertainty about the economic outlook slowly begins to dissipate investors should become a bit less risk averse moreover the flood of treasury issuance to finance 1 trillion fiscal deficits should put some upward pressure on longterm interest rates credit market insights do banks or firms remain cautious the yield curve has steeped considerably since its inversion this summer as fears of an imminent recession have subsided commercial banks however may remain cautious q3 marked the highest net percentage of banks tightening standards for commercial and industrial c i loans since 2016 according to the latest senior loan officer opinion survey in terms of commercial banks aggregate holdings the year over year percentage change of c i loans has been declining since march while this may suggest a more cautious approach to lending among banks demand also seems to be weakening as a net 20 of banks reported weaker demand for business loans in the third quarter uncertainty among businesses was certainly a factor in the third quarter and weaker demand for credit is unsurprising when you consider that business fixed investment grew at its weakest pace in nearly four years as bank s extension of business credit has subsided commercial banks have increased their holdings of treasury and agency securities over the past year at the fastest rate since 2011 this can similarly be viewed as a cautious maneuver by banks taking on safer assets but could also simply be a product of weaker demand from businesses while uncertainty has subsided trade policy and slower global growth continue to weigh on businesses outlooks as such we think it is unlikely that we see a large revival in c i lending in the near term even despite 75 bps of easing by the fomc this year topic of the week boeing production halt is an about face for q1 on monday boeing announced that it will temporarily suspend production on the 737 max program beginning next month in march boeing halted shipments of the jetliner after aviation agencies across the globe grounded it following two fatal crashes with shipments halted boeing cut production to 42 737 max aircraft per month bringing the total produced and currently sitting at production facilities or unused airfields to approximately 400 aircraft since the aircraft were being produced but not shipped in terms of gdp accounting the grounding was expected to produce a drag on equipment spending and net exports which would be roughly offset by an accumulation in inventories as seen in the top chart this has largely been realized with the drop off in aircraft parts shipments and build in inventories since march our working assumption was that boeing would continue to produce the jetliner at its stated rate and once the plane received the all clear to fly boeing would resume shipments by gradually unwinding its built up inventory but with the production rate now falling to zero at the start of next year we have removed the 126 737 max jets that would have been produced in q1 from our forecast aircraft and related parts account for only 2 8 of industrial production ip but by our estimates the 737 max currently accounts for roughly 60 of boeing s production cutting this production to zero therefore manifests itself in a sizeable way in q1 ip the production cut is enough to bring ip into negative territory in q1 and reduce the expected build in inventories by our calculations if the 737 max production cut lasts through the first quarter it would reduce q1 headline gdp growth as much as 0 5 percentage points bottom chart this drag is set to reverse however once production and shipping resume though the exact timing of that remains uncertain our current expectation is that the jet is cleared sometime in q1 with production and shipments resuming in the following quarter this of course remains subject to change and with any new developments we will update our forecast accordingly
confidence isn t optimism or pessimism and it s not a character attribute it s the expectation of a positive outcome rosabeth moss kanter here we are mid december approaching the end of what has been a record setting year for the s p 500 the index is poised to set its second best year in 22 years investors can debate what has prompted this turnaround from the fourth quarter of last year i ll refrain and choose to sit on the sidelines not overly concerned for the why but simply pleased for being on the right side of the trade all year it s been the same theme here week after week as long as the major u s indices remain in their long term uptrend channels and as long as u s economic data isn t foretelling recession there s no reason to try and outthink the situation leave all of the psychoanalysis of the day to day week to week market gyrations to the geniuses that seem to have a plan that changes weekly soon it will be time for analysts to roll out the forecasts for a recession in 2020 or 2021 and what investors should be doing about that now it may be better to learn from the past take the situation one day one week at a time use the existing macro backdrop that is in place today as a template for success remember while the recovery is getting old the credit cycle isn t some will argue that in 2019 stock prices outstripped corporate earnings by a wide margin and investors should be worried i m not about to debate that issue with someone that won t recognize the complete opposite occurred in 2018 nor is it necessary to argue over the fed intervention and financial engineering arguments the s p is at 3 200 the stock market has made the counter arguments for me the trade war that wasn t still garners plenty of attention and it will more than likely remain a prime topic as we transition into next year many analysts have already tipped their hand by including it as a primary issue in their outlook for 2020 the criticism of what transpired regarding the trade deal will be prominent along with speculation and conjecture however the one issue that will matter to investors no escalation is not found anywhere in the narrative as we get closer to year end perhaps a new mindset is in order for anyone that has doubted what is occurring in the equity markets after all this latest rally has sent a strong message to investors so if one believes the stock market is a forward looking instrument they will heed that message and position themselves accordingly here again another issue that doesn t seem worthy of debate with anyone that wants to tell me it isn t worth playing for the last 2 one thing i do know for sure about this bull market it has turned the landscape into a scene from the walking dead each and every genius that chastised the bulls told everyone to get out at each market high and didn t want to play for 2 roams around in a zombie state please don t get the idea that i am falling into the trap of approaching the situation with a closed mind a good dose of common sense and watching the issues that matter is the antidote once common sense is employed there is no need to fall into the same trap that so many succumbed to employing a strategy void of common sense investors also have to understand any strategy has to be tempered with pure common sense the volatility index vix was below 15 for 36 days and was nearing the lowest levels since 2017 until december 3rd when market overreacted to trade headlines the index is still low from a historical perspective and especially compared to last december s level of 35 given that backdrop many are expecting volatility to ascend from and not descend to those historically low levels bull markets thrive on long periods of low volatility and guessing when we may see a spike might not be a good strategy the s p was up in 9 out of the last 10 weeks as trading opened on monday at the end of the day all three major averages dow 30 nasdaq composite and the s p 500 hit new all time highs the russell 2000 pegged a 52 week high as investors pondered the phase one trade deal and decided it was in fact real or maybe it is finally sinking in the boy media that cried wolf trade war simply can t be believed anymore at the end of trading on tuesday the s p had posted five straight days of gains while tallying its 27th new high for the year similar to last week trading was confined to a narrow range through wednesday the s p drifted in a 15 point range the old axiom of never short a dull market held true as the s p ran to 3 222 up 30 points in the last two trading days of the week the dow 30 and the nasdaq also rallied to all time highs the russell continued its run with another 52 week high all of that confirmed the price action was once again very broad based the finish to the trading week saw the sixth record close in the last seven trading days for the s p 500 that makes 32 for the year looking back since the s p 500 first broke out in late october we ve seen record closes at a pace of once every other day a nightmare scenario for anyone trying to hedge i relayed the stock market s message on october 17th the probability of stocks going higher perhaps much higher remains very elevated and it was met with skepticism by some who stubbornly remained with their views insiders and funds are selling at the greatest pace since 2008 2009 a serious signal and a reliable one deflation is soon coming values are pumped up very high now america is only receiving funds because of global fund flows from europe which is a disaster and articles in october focusing on the market outlook painted a bleak picture the markets speak and they are stalled the u s is losing leverage with china forget 3 000 on the s p 500 getting ready for the next bear market high yielding alternatives propositions for a recessionary bear market it appears some weren t paying attention to what really matters european equities powered to new high closing levels this past week that are significant from a technical perspective the euro stoxx which tracks eurozone equity markets is trading at the highest levels since january 3rd of 2008 the index would need to gain another 9 07 to eclipse the highs from the mid 2000s cycle and another 14 82 to hit all time highs above the march 2000 peak euro and japan equity markets made new highs this week emerging markets are at eight month highs the synchronized global equity rally continues to signal the return of global growth next year despite china s shanghai composite being stuck in a multi month sideways range the index is up 5 2 month to date economy the final read on q3 gdp was unchanged from the earlier reported 2 1 personal consumption was bumped up to 3 2 better than expected versus 2 9 previously we all hear the statistic that household debt totaled a record 14 trillion in the third quarter up 2 8 trillion since it bottomed during q2 2013 that makes for juicy news headlines for anyone that wants to sound the alarm bells allow me to take out the clapper in those bells the household debt service ratio debt payments to disposable personal income has fallen from the q4 2007 peak of 13 2 to 9 7 the lowest on record dating to 1980 that low point was right before the beginning of the last secular bull market bespoke investment group keeps the tariff situation in context as far as tax receipts go november data shows that the very rapid surge in customs duties has continued the three month average of customs duty receipts has risen to 37 basis points of gdp or roughly 3 3 of goods imports on a value basis with all the noise around tariffs and trade it s easy to lose context and forget just how small the tariffs are relative to either the total size of the economy or goods imports alone most sales taxes at the state or city level run at least that high keep in mind though the magnitude of customs duties is absolutely tiny relative to other forms of taxation for instance individual income taxes are 44x the size of customs duties while social insurance taxes funding social security medicare and medicaid are more than 17x as large as customs duties from day one the

expectations for business activity in the year ahead lifted higher in both sectors to reach the highest since june to suggest the expansion will continue to gain momentum as we head into the new year optimism reflected reduced fears over trade wars and more favorable financial conditions the brighter news needs to be caveated as the overall rate of economic expansion signaled by the surveys remains well below that seen this time last year commensurate with gdp rising at an annualised rate of just over 1 5 importantly however the welcome signs of improvement help to ward off recession

for resisting a politically motivated impeachment charge judiciary committee democrats voted to impeach the president and that recommendation was sent to the house for a vote in the entire house no

at hand while the angst over the trade war has lessened somewhat after the phase one deal money managers still regard that as their number one concern crude oil the trade deficit for crude oil has

a time for reversion to the mean but i wouldn t try to time or play that eventuality there has been a boatload of money flushed down the drain trying to hedge in the last two weeks no need to guess what may occur instead it will be important to concentrate on the short term pivots that are meaningful however the long term view the view from 30 000 feet is the only way to make successful decisions these details are available in my daily updates to subscribers short term views are presented to give market participants a feel for the current situation it should be noted that strategic investment decisions should not be based on any short term view these views contain a lot of noise and will lead an investor into whipsaw action that tends to detract from overall performance bespoke investment group bloomberg s weekly poll of consumer comfort allows us to see how sentiment breaks down along political party lines below is a chart showing sentiment for republicans and democrats using bloomberg s consumer comfort reading going back to 1990 in 2019 republican confidence stood at some of the strongest levels since at least the 1990 s given all of the polarization and butting heads in politics you might expect the opposite to hold true for the confidence of democrats source bespoke but in 2019 confidence among democrats actually reached its highest level since 2000 although the upward trajectory has not been nearly as strong as that of republicans as could be expected when the opposing party occupies the oval office the reading for democrats is much higher now than it was at this point in bush ii s presidency individual stocks and sectors the breakout in the financial sector this week is worth noting if this breakout can be sustained and is eventually deemed valid it sends a very important message the spdr select financial etf xlf has traded sideways for 12 years before moving above the 2007 high something to be aware of and monitor as we head into 2020 semiconductors as tracked by the etf smh also added another new high the entire market rally is very broad based and is on solid footing as we sit here with barely two full trading weeks left in the year the bears hope for a late christmas gift of something going wrong hasn t occurred their insistence that this stock market was a house of cards ready to fall has been turned into a nightmare ironically all of their key issues have come falling down around them the fed is out of the equation brexit has more clarity the usmca deal is about to be signed escalation in the china u s trade negotiations is off the table while all are important the usmca trade deal is especially significant and is a huge positive year to date through september canada and mexico were virtually tied for first place in trade with the u s with china coming in third yet investors hardly heard it mentioned all year instead we heard recession warnings ramped up when the majority believed we were entering a trade war with mexico more jump to conclusion speak before you think commentary given the job market and a strong consumer it is now a reality that recession isn t part of the scenario in the near term allow me one last time to call out anyone that told investors to be wary of recession in 2019 morgan stanley says economy is on recession watch ray dalio says recession risk is rising i could go on and on investors seem to be mesmerized by these types of forecasts fear sells i do wonder when morality makes an appearance more unbiased non agenda commentary would be refreshing but i digress just as we have seen countless times corporate earnings will now become the focus rightfully so they have propelled the indices during the bull market s p 500 earnings have increased by 49 from 2016 through 2019 meanwhile for all those giant earnings gains the s p 500 has risen by 40 the bears cringe at that statistic it simply doesn t fit their narrative the consensus view today raises the question how long can this rally last a legitimate thought and we all know it will end at some point but the damage to anyone doubting the advance has been done debates will rage on but in my view the time for debate has come and gone the stock market has settled that argument unless there is a complete collapse in the last few trading days of 2019 highly unlikely bullish investors will have enjoyed an excellent year these gains didn t come easy as naysayers pounded their stories to abort this rally every step of the way the skeptics need to regroup and come up with another wrong footed story to sell for those that are still with us i wish them the very best of luck for myself i have a clear conscience they were warned merry christmas happy and healthy holidays to all i would also

i have argued that in sub sahara africa most demonstrations protests and mass citizens actions are deeply attributed to rant seeking political corruption marginalization mismanagement malfeasances pronounced deprivation of wellbeing and unequal distribution of resources on the part of the political leaderships of the continent these several of menaces have harnessed and continue to midwife civil conflicts in most part of africa here i would build a comparative analysis between liberia and rwanda given the conspicuous similarities of both countries gloomy historical past by amara quardu mohammed kamara contributor like liberia rwanda experienced a dreadful historic genocide that owned the lives of about 1 million rwandans including women and children of the tutsi minority tribe and moderate hutus this happened as a result of what i have mentioned above the rwandan nation was completely paralyzed and failed world bank then referred to the country as nonviable the war had obliterated virtually everything most competent bureaucrats had been killed or fled and looters had stripped government offices down to the last piece of paper all government institutions were looted and vandalized when the post conflict government of national unity had taken charge in july 1994 the country had no running water and little electricity the new president kagame had no idea either did his colleagues have much expertise or institutional knowledge to draw on in reconsolidating the broken fabrics of the rwandan society before the genocide the country had about eight hundred judges but fewer had survived the mass slaughter as mentioned today rwanda s case is completely different as the country has buckled its belt for governance and human capital investment it has transitioned from hopelessness to hopefulness and is now considered as the singapore of africa within twenty five years less than what was projected for rwanda to re establish itself as a sovereign country and positive member of the comity of nations this synonymously depicts the liberian nation a country that was once seen as an epicenter of the fourteen years of civil conflicts from late 1989 to 2003 had embraced peace through the intervention of the then american president george w bush and other world leaders mainly the circle of the united nations it is estimated that about two hundred fifty thousand people were killed during the civil conflict like rwanda the liberian civil conflict had its historical root embedded in the class system orchestrated by the freed slaves after the rebellions in the americas and were migrated and settled in liberia the powerful elites congou though a very small population had ruled the country for almost 133 years the natives who account for the country s highest population had been politically and socially excluded and soon revenged against the ruling class when the opportunity for redemption availed itself this resulted in a military coup d état in april 1980 and resulted to master sgt samuel k doe and his men in arms murdering president william r tolbert at his executive mansion office this caused a prolonged period of anarchy characterized by ethnicity and plunder sadly the ringleader of the coup due to similar reasons he president samuel k doe was in 1990 slaughtered by then leader of the independent national patriotic front and now a member of the liberian senate sen prince y johnson these historical circumstances breaded the liberian civil war which led to massive atrocities and agony following the cessation of hostilities by various parties in 2003 the national transitional government of liberia ntgl headed by the late charles gyude bryant took charge as the country s interim government from 2003 to 2006 this interim arrangement took the country to its first postwar democratic elections that subsequently brought the first elected female president on the continent of africa mrs ellen j sirleaf even after the interim leadership state capacity was limitedly weak to enhance governance and set the pace for national development almost every sector of the country was broken and needed to be rebuilt poverty and diseases had ransacked the country and its people liberia was considered a failed state backed by indebtedness during the administration of the former president mrs ellen j sirleaf liberia graduated from the heavily indebted poor country hipc from the rankings of the international monetary fund imf and the world bank interestingly and despite the similar historical circumstances that beclouded the two countries liberia is yet to regain its full capabilities in governance rule of law and inclusive sustainable development currently reconciliation and political division are increasing challenges to national unity and development unlike rwanda the lessons of the civil conflict have not resonated with the country s government and people there are visibly vices that are considered conflict triggers corruption inequality and social discrimination rwanda s rebirth is accredited to the country s progressive leadership championed by h e president paul kagame whose immaculate leadership has led his country to rapid economic and human capital development can protests and demonstrations hold in rwanda this is hypothetical considering the progress that the country is making with the full participation of about 12 million rwandans who have embraced peace and harmony and involved in the rebuilding efforts of their great country there seems to be zero iotas of citizens actions or any act of political instability because the country has spectacularly positioned itself to achieve economic and social development of its people and onward ensure sustainable livelihoods the reasons i have not seen nor heard about demonstrations and protests in rwanda or even attempting to coin a campaign for kagame step down is that governance in rwanda is participatory the leadership ensures the country s economic development like agricultural employment empowerment job creations regional trades digital economy and infrastructural development etc is done collectively with inclusivity being the hallmark rwanda runs a private sector driven economy through the privatization of major parastastals and public private partnerships to ensure rural dwellers involvement in economic activities the government with supports from development partners has invested millions of dollars in the agricultural sector which ensures food security and job creations for farmers across the country while the private sector is reducing unemployment in the youthful population skilled and unskilled youths are being employed in rwandan firms and industries and as well as foreign investments now drawing from this economic approach would you think that rwandans will stand up for protests and frequent demonstrations a strong economic framework can birth social and political stability which keeps the people actively engaged and developmental for liberia our case is totally different and highly punctuated with a question mark those vices that orchestrated our civil conflict are empirically vivid in present day liberian society they have not abated at all we have not fully reconciled as a country neither have we learned the lessons of the past we have failed to win the war against political corruption marginalization unemployment and systemic mismanagement of our natural endowments these menaces have kept us dependent and undermined liberia s economic prosperity for decades this aspect has given reasons for mass based citizens actions in demand for transformative leadership good governance approach and transparency in the management of the country s resources opposition parties are of course ensuring that the government is greatly accountable to the governed drawing on its manifestos development framework which keeps the opposition parties reminded on checks and balances in government in both governments sirleaf and weah there have been calls to terminate the tenures of the regimes in the names of ellen step down and weah step down campaigns by citizens and politicians based on extreme poverty and lack of sustained economic development of the people the sirleaf chronicles former president ellen j sirleaf is remembered for ensuring efficient and effective performance of the ministries departments and agencies which set governance on the pace for performance through competent experienced and skilled administrators most liberian youths in her government were given opportunities for capacity development and scholarship opportunities were afforded to many liberian students desired for foreign education which propelled them to contribute to nation building efforts in both private and public sectors as mentioned sirleaf ensured that liberia graduated from the heavily indebted poor country hipc from the rankings of the international monetary fund imf and the world bank her accomplishments are enormous as she built roads that connected liberia s capital monrovia to connecting counties her efforts on infrastructural development are conspicuous according to economists her supports to road connectivity have created externalities for rural dwellers who are involved in farming activities yet her 12 years of leadership was expected to have created the country s development framework on the foundation of radical economic development that will guarantee employment of liberian youths who account for nearly 60 of our population considering her strong relationship with washington and aids received from donor countries and institutions this was not achieved and opportunities to achieve them were squandered due to classic corruption malfeasance rant seeking and the mismanagement of the country s resources madam sirleaf s policy on salaries of some heads of government was astronomically high while civil servants were working poor like many others the former maritime boss hon binyal kesselly was alleged to have received a monthly salary of usd 25 000 amidst rampant corruption extreme poverty massive unemployment declining economy infant and maternal mortalities extreme crime rates and fragile healthcare delivery services across liberia while heads of soes and autonomous agencies liberia petroleum refinery corporation national oil company of liberia national port authority liberia telecommunications authority and liberia revenue authority amongst others allegedly received 15 to 20 usd as monthly salaries this happened when healthcare workers were frequently on go slow actions in demand for increment and incentives while lecturers at the state run university and other public colleges were similarly abandoning classes due to low budgetary allotments at the same time the unemployed youths were regularly seen agitating for sustained jobs and skills that will make them potential citizens as a result of fiscal indiscipline in her government state coffers were depleted and our resources were gang raped and bastardized dating to sirleaf s administration i argue that her legacy is marked by systemic controversy some done some na done while i appreciate significant progress reforms in governance and public bureaucracy but at the average our people were robbed of their dignity and condemned to extreme poverty weah s conundrums is gbekugbeh learning from his predecessor well one would not conclude president george m weah s success or failure as he has gone nearly 2 years of his 6 years term however what seems to be vivid is the incompetence of the bureaucrats who supposedly run the day to day activities of the executive branch of government his early approach to governance was highly unorthodox positions were rewarded to his loyalists and partisans based on political reciprocity not competence as it has termed to be nevertheless mr weah has got a spectacular history to learn from mrs sirleaf vices that were ingrained in sirleaf s administration are unearthing in his government wearing reflective jackets his government is accused of massive corruption and siphoning of the state coffers for personal initiatives with a practical example of his duplexes and the jamaica resort property this accusation has triggered numerous protests in demand of accountability in the case involving the 16 billion liberian dollars that were allegedly confiscated and unaccounted and as well calls for the ministry of finance and central bank of liberia to provide findings on the expenditure of the 25 million dollars meant to mob up the economy sadly the president has remained tightlipped on these multiple accusations and the economic prosperity of his people remains a fantasy this has certainly rejuvenated the campaign to oust him from the presidency through a protest designed weah stepdown under the canopy of counsel of patriots conventional wisdom dictates that poverty and hunger cannot be compromised when the people are excessively hungry they result in demanding radical solutions to instantaneous change this has led to forceful removal heads of governments in africa and elsewhere the question of how we change the narrative remains a task to ponder there are diverse views as to how the former can be changed and the country s economic development is secured some argue that a lack of political will on the part of our leaders has increased the existing problems while others believe that liberia s problems are tied to its historical foundation and the behavioral issues mentality of the people towards the country remains structurally undeveloped as for pundits and academics they argue that the quality of leadership sets the country for progress and sustainable development the above is true for instance economic hardships are common and prevalent in weak and developing countries in asia and sub sahara africa which are caused as a result of policy failures implementation gaps and state capacity gaps however the latter can be solved and the solutions are considered sustainable when applied first the liberian government should consider effective and efficient political leadership will that enables our leaders to be deeply committed to radical economic reforms in practical terms and advance working solutions to our existing problems second the government must increase supports to public projects that will in turn attract investments and create avenues for employment and favorable policies that attract foreign investments and boom local economies third most likely the government is advised to invest in the agricultural sector which is the bedrock for economic growth and development it is the ladder used by advanced and developing economies to support economic development and macroeconomic stability lastly rule of law which drives citizens and investors confidence in the state should be uncompromised people must have trust in the system to seek redress at all time and impartial judgment is served regardless who is involved this will further ensure judicial independence to end hunger and poverty as part of sdgs 1 2 developing economy like liberia must prioritize agriculture development as a major frontier for economic development which will support human and infrastructural developments job creation for both unskilled and skilled laborers food security contribution to national income pre requisite for raw materials and as well earn valuable foreign exchange through export of our agricultural products are major advantages of the sector conclusion peace and development are intrinsically intertwined for a lasting and reliable peace to be attained it is significantly fundamental for the government to consider economic systems that can generate sustained economic growth guarantee for the mass of the people s economic prosperity and development depression or prolonged deprivation by itself is a conduit for social conflict and as well as routine protests and demonstrations against political leadership this aspect was not vividly recognized by ex liberian president mrs ellen j sirleaf critics argue that she received impressively global recognitions and accolades which did not translate practically to reconciliation and economic development of her country and people drawing from rwanda s experience in peace conflict management and prevention it s imperative that the current leadership of the country models its development framework as rwanda given that both countries share similar historical experiences in terms of conflict triggers a lesson that has resonated greatly with governance in east africa in the aspect of the presidency it s essential for the president to surround himself with a team of experts local and international comprising persons of diverse backgrounds technicians technocrats architects experienced administrators legal pundits diplomats public policy experts to review analyze evaluate and advise the president on social economic political and foreign policy issues of the country these experts

most major economies have likely averted recession for now but growth will remain subdued in 2020 according to reuters polls despite the recent round of central bank stimulus and signs of a preliminary truce in the u s china trade war several big central banks have cut interest rates this year responding to a slowdown that few policymakers had expected around this time in 2018 that loss of momentum in the global economy was driven in part by a crunch in world trade but with rates still low in developed economies and with many emerging economies snagged in the slowdown further impetus for global growth will need to come from elsewhere that will have implications for financial markets which had a banner year in 2019 with wall street near a record and other equity markets flying high on was is only a slightly improved economic backdrop and tentative steps on trade while a few economies notably the united states have stabilised very late in one of the longest expansionary periods on record a vigorous snapback to above trend performance is not likely according to predictions from hundreds of forecasters polled by reuters in recent weeks despite unprecedented action from the world s central banks global growth and inflation remain subdued more than 10 years after the great recession noted joseph quinlan chief investment officer for market strategy at bofa global research meaningful reflation and inflation remains elusive creating fears among investors that central banks are pushing on a string a modest u s economic growth outlook has barely budged following three interest rate cuts from the federal reserve this year and even with economists now reasonably confident an initial washington beijing trade deal will be signed the chances of an outright recession in major economies have receded since the middle of the year when they jumped to highs not seen in reuters polls since the financial crisis that is partly down to the latest round of global rate cuts but in india for example where the reserve bank of india has slashed interest rates five times in succession by 135 basis points to 5 15 making it the most aggressive major central bank in the world in 2019 growth is still slowing and the property market is in the doldrums and the round of global easing is nearing an end sweden s central bank on thursday ended five years of negative rates by raising its benchmark repo rate by a quarter point to zero as expected but the riksbank also indicated that it expected to keep rates unchanged through 2021 bank of japan governor haruhiko kuroda signalled his resolve to keep the money spigot wide open but suggested that no immediate expansion of stimulus was forthcoming other major central banks were also forecast to stay on the sidelines in 2020 according to economists in reuters polls there is a growing sense among analysts polled this year that central banks not only have lost their ability to lift inflation which still remains tame but also may be losing their post crisis powers to drive up asset prices while the rise in financial assets has handily outpaced underlying economic performance that disconnect may end next year according to currency strategists equity analysts fixed income strategists and global fund managers in reuters polls 2019 has turned out to be that rarity a spectacular year for both equity and fixed income returns by any yardstick financial markets have put in a very creditable performance for 2019 it is one that will be hard to repeat in 2020 said ajay rajadhyaksha head of macro research at barclays most stock indexes covered by reuters in the latest global poll were forecast to make single digit gains in 2020 major government bond yields meanwhile were not expected to rebound from their latest lows looking ahead monetary policy largesse over the past decade increases the risks of a disorderly rise in bond yields and could also amplify a policy mistake and or increase the risks of monetary policy impotence noted bofa s quinlan higher debt levels have failed to deliver stronger growth he added even global property prices with a few notable exceptions have put in a dull or no response to the latest round of central bank easing housing market experts are not optimistic about any kind of major rebound in the coming year and in the foreign exchange market the u s dollar s reign was forecast to continue despite diminishing returns from the most overcrowded trade of 2019 the dollar has been persistently strong even this year it has continued to eke out a small gain despite the fact that the fed has cut rates on three occasions so even at these lower u s yields the dollar looks relatively attractive said lee hardman currency strategist at mufg source reuters additional reporting and analysis by vivek mishra and rahul karunakar graphics by vivek mishra editing by ross finley and nick zieminski
the perspective atlanta georgia december 21 2019 passing on the corruption legacy i have argued that in sub sahara africa most demonstrations protests and mass citizens actions are deeply attributed to rant seeking political corruption marginalization mismanagement malfeasances pronounced deprivation of wellbeing and unequal distribution of resources on the part of the political leaderships of the continent these several menaces have harnessed and continue to midwife civil conflicts in most parts of africa here i would build a comparative analysis between liberia and rwanda given the conspicuous similarities of both countries gloomy historical past like liberia rwanda experienced a dreadful historic genocide that owned the lives of about 1 million rwandans including women and children of the tutsi minority tribe and moderate hutus this happened as a result of what i have mentioned above the rwandan nation was completely paralyzed and failed world bank then referred to the country as nonviable the war had obliterated virtually everything most competent bureaucrats had been killed or fled and looters had stripped government offices down to the last piece of paper all government institutions were looted and vandalized when the post conflict government of national unity had taken charge in july 1994 the country had no running water and little electricity the new president kagame had no idea either did his colleagues have much expertise or institutional knowledge to draw on in reconsolidating the broken fabrics of the rwandan society before the genocide the country had about eight hundred judges but fewer had survived the mass slaughter as mentioned today rwanda s case is completely different as the country has buckled its belt for governance and human capital investment it has transitioned from hopelessness to hopefulness and is now considered as the singapore of africa within twenty five years less than what was projected for rwanda to re establish itself as a sovereign country and positive member of the comity of nations this synonymously depicts the liberian nation a country that was once seen as an epicenter of the fourteen years of civil conflicts from late 1989 to 2003 had embraced peace through the intervention of the then american president george w bush and other world leaders mainly the circle of the united nations it is estimated that about two hundred fifty thousand people were killed during the civil conflict like rwanda the liberian civil conflict had its historical root embedded in the class system orchestrated by the freed slaves after the rebellions in the americas and were migrated and settled in liberia the powerful elites congau though a very small population had ruled the country for almost 133 years the natives who account for the country s highest population had been politically and socially excluded and soon revenged against the ruling class when the opportunity for redemption availed itself this resulted in a military coup d état in april 1980 and resulted in master sgt samuel k doe and his men in arms murdering president william r tolbert at his executive mansion office this caused a prolonged period of anarchy characterized by ethnicity and plunder sadly the ringleader of the coup due to similar reasons he president samuel k doe was in 1990 slaughtered by then leader of the independent national patriotic front and now a member of the liberian senate sen prince y johnson these historical circumstances breaded the liberian civil war which led to massive atrocities and agony following the cessation of hostilities by various parties in 2003 the national transitional government of liberia ntgl headed by the late charles gyude bryant took charge as the country s interim government from 2003 to 2006 this interim arrangement took the country to its first postwar democratic elections that subsequently brought the first elected female president on the continent of africa mrs ellen j sirleaf even after the interim leadership state capacity was limitedly weak to enhance governance and set the pace for national development almost every sector of the country was broken and needed to be rebuilt poverty and diseases had ransacked the country and its people liberia was considered a failed state backed by indebtedness during the administration of the former president mrs ellen j sirleaf liberia graduated from the heavily indebted poor country hipc from the rankings of the international monetary fund imf and the world bank interestingly and despite the similar historical circumstances that beclouded the two countries liberia is yet to regain its full capabilities in governance rule of law and inclusive sustainable development currently reconciliation and political division are increasing challenges to national unity and development unlike rwanda the lessons of the civil conflict have not resonated with the country s government and people there are visibly vices that are considered conflict triggers corruption inequality and social discrimination rwanda s rebirth is accredited to the country s progressive leadership championed by h e president paul kagame whose immaculate leadership has led his country to rapid economic and human capital development can protests and demonstrations hold in rwanda this is hypothetical considering the progress that the country is making with the full participation of about 12 million rwandans who have embraced peace and harmony and involved in the rebuilding efforts of their great country there seem to be zero iotas of citizens actions or any act of political instability because the country has spectacularly positioned itself to achieve economic and social development of its people and onward ensure sustainable livelihoods the reason i have not seen nor heard about demonstrations and protests in rwanda or even attempting to coin a campaign for kagame step down is that the governance in rwanda is participatory the leadership ensures the country s economic development like agricultural employment empowerment job creations regional trades digital economy and infrastructural development etc is done collectively with inclusivity being the hallmark rwanda runs a private sector driven economy through the privatization of major parastatals and public private partnerships to ensure rural dwellers involvement in economic activities the government with supports from development partners has invested millions of dollars in the agricultural sector which ensures food security and job creations for farmers across the country while the private sector is reducing unemployment in the youthful population skilled and unskilled youths are being employed in rwandan firms and industries and as well as foreign investments now drawing from this economic approach would you think that rwandans will stand up for protests and frequent demonstrations a strong economic framework can birth social and political stability which keeps the people actively engaged and developmental for liberia our case is totally different and highly punctuated with a question mark those vices that orchestrated our civil conflict are empirically vivid in present day liberian society they have not abated at all we have not fully reconciled as a country neither have we learned the lessons of the past we have failed to win the war against political corruption marginalization unemployment and systemic mismanagement of our natural endowments these menaces have kept us dependent and undermined liberia s economic prosperity for decades this aspect has given reasons for mass based citizens actions in demand for transformative leadership good governance approach and transparency in the management of the country s resources opposition parties are of course ensuring that the government is greatly accountable to the governed drawing on its manifestos development framework which keeps the opposition parties reminded on checks and balances in government in both governments sirleaf and weah there have been calls to terminate the tenures of the regimes in the names of ellen step down and weah step down campaigns by citizens and politicians based on extreme poverty and lack of sustained economic development of the people the sirleaf chronicles former president ellen j sirleaf is remembered for ensuring efficient and effective performance of the ministries departments and agencies which set governance on the pace for performance through competent experienced and skilled administrators most liberian youths in her government were given opportunities for capacity development and scholarship opportunities were afforded to many liberian students desired for foreign education which propelled them to contribute to nation building efforts in both private and public sectors as mentioned sirleaf ensured that liberia graduated from the heavily indebted poor country hipc from the rankings of the international monetary fund imf and the world bank her accomplishments are enormous as she built roads that connected liberia s capital monrovia to connecting counties her efforts on infrastructural development are conspicuous according to economists her supports to road connectivity have created externalities for rural dwellers who are involved in farming activities yet her 12 years of leadership was expected to have created the country s development framework on the foundation of radical economic development that will guarantee employment of liberian youths who account for nearly 60 of our population considering her strong relationship with washington and aids received from donor countries and institutions this was not achieved and opportunities to achieve them were squandered due to classic corruption malfeasance rant seeking and the mismanagement of the country s resources madam sirleaf s policy on salaries of some heads of government was astronomically high while civil servants were working poor like many others the former maritime boss hon binyal kesselly was alleged to have received a monthly salary of usd 25 000 amidst rampant corruption extreme poverty massive unemployment declining economy infant and maternal mortalities extreme crime rates and fragile healthcare delivery services across liberia while heads of soes and autonomous agencies liberia petroleum refinery corporation national oil company of liberia national port authority liberia telecommunications authority and liberia revenue authority amongst others allegedly received 15 to 20 usd as monthly salaries this happened when healthcare workers were frequently on go slow actions in demand for increment and incentives while lecturers at the state run university and other public colleges were similarly abandoning classes due to low budgetary allotments at the same time the unemployed youths were regularly seen agitating for sustained jobs and skills that will make them potential citizens as a result of fiscal indiscipline in her government state coffers were depleted and our resources were gang raped and bastardized dating to sirleaf s administration i argue that her legacy is marked by systemic controversy some done some na done while i appreciate significant progress reforms in governance and public bureaucracy but at the average our people were robbed of their dignity and condemned to extreme poverty weah s conundrums is gbekugbeh learning from his predecessor well one would not conclude president george m weah s success or failure as he has gone nearly 2 years of his 6 years term however what seems to be vivid is the incompetence of the bureaucrats who supposedly run the day to day activities of the executive branch of government his early approach to governance was highly unorthodox positions were rewarded to his loyalists and partisans based on political reciprocity not competence as it has termed to be nevertheless mr weah has got a spectacular history to learn from mrs sirleaf vices that were ingrained in sirleaf s administration are unearthing in his government wearing reflective jackets his government is accused of massive corruption and siphoning of the state coffers for personal initiatives with a practical example of his duplexes and the jamaica resort property this accusation has triggered numerous protests in demand of accountability in the case involving the 16 billion liberian dollars that were allegedly confiscated and unaccounted and as well calls for the ministry of finance and central bank of liberia to provide findings on the expenditure of the 25 million dollars meant to mob up the economy sadly the president has remained tightlipped on these multiple accusations and the economic prosperity of his people remains a fantasy this has certainly rejuvenated the campaign to oust him from the presidency through a protest designed weah stepdown under the canopy of council of patriots conventional wisdom dictates that poverty and hunger cannot be compromised when the people are excessively hungry they result in demanding radical solutions to instantaneous change this has led to forceful removal heads of governments in africa and elsewhere the question of how we change the narrative remains a task to ponder there are diverse views as to how the former can be changed and the country s economic development is secured some argue that a lack of political will on the part of our leaders has increased the existing problems while others believe that liberia s problems are tied to its historical foundation and the behavioral issues mentality of the people towards the country remains structurally undeveloped as for pundits and academics they argue that the quality of leadership sets the country for progress and sustainable development the above is true for instance economic hardships are common and prevalent in weak and developing countries in asia and sub sahara africa which are caused as a result of policy failures implementation gaps and state capacity gaps however the latter can be solved and the solutions are considered sustainable when applied first the liberian government should consider effective and efficient political leadership that will enable our leaders to be deeply committed to radical economic reforms in practical terms and advance working solutions to our existing problems second the government must increase supports to public projects that will in turn attract investments and create avenues for employment and favorable policies that attract foreign investments and boom local economies third most likely the government is advised to invest in the agricultural sector which is the bedrock for economic growth and development it is the ladder used by advanced and developing economies to support economic development and macroeconomic stability lastly rule of law which drives citizens and investors confidence in the state should be uncompromised people must have trust in the system to seek redress at all time and impartial judgment is served regardless who is involved this will further ensure judicial independence to end hunger and poverty as part of sdgs 1 2 developing economy like liberia must prioritize agriculture development as a major frontier for economic development which will support human and infrastructural developments job creation for both unskilled and skilled laborers food security contribution to national income pre requisite for raw materials and as well earn valuable foreign exchange through export of our agricultural products are major advantages of the sector conclusion peace and development are intrinsically intertwined for a lasting and reliable peace to be attained it is significantly fundamental for the government to consider economic systems that can generate sustained economic growth guarantee for the mass of the people s economic prosperity and development depression or prolonged deprivation by itself is a conduit for social conflict and as well as routine protests and demonstrations against political leadership this aspect was not vividly recognized by ex liberian president mrs ellen j sirleaf critics argue that she received impressively global recognitions and accolades which did not translate practically to reconciliation and economic development of her country and people drawing from rwanda s experience in peace conflict management and prevention it s imperative that the current leadership of the country models its development framework as rwanda given that both countries share similar historical experiences in terms of conflict triggers a lesson that has resonated greatly with governance in east africa in the aspect of the presidency it s essential for the president to surround himself with a team of experts local and international comprising persons of diverse backgrounds technicians technocrats architects experienced administrators legal pundits diplomats public policy experts to review analyze evaluate and advise the president on social economic political and foreign policy issues of the country these experts will also review critically void of political maneuvering all policy issues arising from the legislature and the judiciary and well as ministries departments and

the most striking aspect of the sixth democratic presidential candidates debate held thursday night in the aftermath of trump s impeachment was the questions that were not asked by the moderators and the issues that were not addressed by the participants democratic presidential candidates from left sen elizabeth warren d mass former vice president joe biden sen bernie sanders i vt sen amy klobuchar d minn and businessman tom steyer participate during a democratic presidential primary debate thursday dec 19 2019 in los angeles ap photo chris carlson the seven candidates for the democratic presidential nomination who qualified for the event were former vice president joe biden vermont senator bernie sanders massachusetts senator elizabeth warren south bend indiana mayor pete buttigieg minnesota senator amy klobuchar internet entrepreneur andrew yang and billionaire businessman tom steyer national polls show the top three spots held down by biden sanders and warren with buttigieg leading the rest of the field in single digits the candidates repeatedly stressed the urgency of ousting trump in 2020 and jousted over which of them was best placed to accomplish the task this was combined with populist rhetoric attacking billionaires and pledges to increase taxes on the rich to pay for better health care and schools and a more humane immigration policy yet neither the moderators of the los angeles event nor any of the candidates raised the fact that the house vote approving articles of impeachment against president trump was bracketed by congressional votes in which the democratic party voted by wide margins to pass the white house s key legislative priorities these include a massive increase in military spending a new north american trade pact usmca directed particularly against china and continued funding of trump s anti immigrant border wall with mexico this convenient omission of the basic agreement between the democratic party and trump on militarism trade war and attacks on democratic rights illuminates the sheer cynicism and hypocrisy of the event and the fraud of the democrats posturing as an alternative to trump for working people or the middle class another remarkable omission was any discussion of the candidates policies toward ukraine the name of the country does not even appear in the transcript of the more than two hour event russia was mentioned only once by name by andrew yang and the name putin appears only once in a remark by former vice president biden this is extraordinary given the fact that the debate was held barely 24 hours after the democratic controlled house of representatives voted in a party line vote to make trump the third president in us history to be impeached based on his withholding of military aid to us ally ukraine said to be waging a hot war against russian aggression there was no discussion of how the seven candidates if elected would reverse trump s supposedly dovish posture toward moscow and escalate the us diplomatic economic and military confrontation with nuclear armed russia something which has virtually no popular support among the american people it seemed that both the moderators led by pbs newshour anchor judy woodruff and the democratic contenders were eager to dispense with the entire issue of impeachment as quickly as possible woodruff raised it as the first question noting the failure of the democrats in the course of three weeks of public hearings to generate strong majority support in the country for the removal of trump from office none of the candidates in their answers addressed her question as to why this was the case and what they would do to build greater support for impeachment after a few perfunctory minutes of canned replies the issue was dropped another omission that while entirely predictable nevertheless underscored the two facedness of the democratic campaign was the cases of imprisoned journalist julian assange and the whistle blower chelsea manning two so called centrist i e right wing candidates pete buttigieg and amy klobuchar both raised the issue of freedom of the press to attack trump for his baiting of the largely pro impeachment media klobuchar noting that her father was a newspaperman declared that the freedom of the press is deep in my heart but she and the rest of the democrats including the so called progressives bernie sanders and elizabeth warren support the persecution and jailing of assange and manning precisely for exercising press freedom in exposing us war crimes on the question of china the candidates if anything sought to outflank trump from the right in demanding an escalation of the us drive to cripple china and prevent it from dislodging the us as the premier pacific power biden said he would seek un international sanctions against china for its alleged human rights abuses against the muslim uighurs we should be moving 60 percent of our sea power to that area of the world he declared to let in fact the chinese understand that they re not going to go any further we ve got to make clear we are a pacific power and we are not going to back away buttigieg said he would consider boycotting the 2022 beijing olympics klobuchar said i think we need to keep our promises and keep our threats a major focus of media post mortems of the debate was what commentators described as an angry eruption between buttigieg and warren this squabble however only exposed the fraud of the various candidates attempts to portray themselves as clean hands opponents of the corporate elite at one point warren looking for a way to attack buttigieg who has reportedly been climbing at her expense in iowa where the first primary contest will take place in seven weeks proclaimed her independence from corporate campaign money and denounced the indiana mayor for holding a fundraiser for wealthy donors in a wine cave sanctimoniously stating i will not sell access to my time warren added billionaires in wine caves should not pick the next president of the united states buttigieg bluntly defended taking money from corporate donors and replied coolly this is the problem of issuing purity tests you yourself cannot pass he then noted that warren had accepted donations from corporations and financial interests in her prior senate election campaigns and channeled left over funds into her presidential war chest as for vermont senator bernie sanders he continued to posture as a populist and quasi socialist tribune of working people and bane of the billionaire class he repeated his rhetoric about a political revolution meaning nothing more than electing him as president and democrats to national state and local office he declared we are living in a nation increasingly becoming an oligarchy where you have a handful of billionaires who spend hundreds of millions of dollars buying elections and politicians the issue is not old or young male or female the issue is working people standing up taking on the billionaire class and creating a government and economy that works for all not just the 1 percent sanders is fully aware that in making such statements he is talking out of both sides of his mouth that he has no intention of conducting the type of struggle requiring a real revolution needed to transform the american economy into one that works for all is revealed by the fact that he is running to represent a party that supports the same basic policies as the fascist trump as demonstrated in the budget and usmca votes this week this is a party moreover that completed the deregulation of wall street under bill clinton and responded to the ensuing crash of 2008 by allocating trillions of tax payer dollars under obama to bail out the criminals responsible for the crisis the bill for this rescue operation is still being paid by the working class in the form of mass layoffs wage cuts and the destruction of health care education and pensions on the issue of trade war with china sanders staked out a position to the right of other candidates in the debate boasting that he had voted against the now superseded north american free trade agreement nafta he said the new pact did not go far enough promoting economic nationalism to pit us workers against their counterparts south of the border he said it is not going to stop outsourcing it is not going to stop corporations from moving to mexico where manufacturing workers make less than 2 an hour
friedrich ebert stiftung recently published an essay by eric lecompte entitled keeping our promises to finance development read an excerpt below or find the full text here macroscope keeping our promises to finance development according to unctad the sustainable development goals sdgs could be achieved with a 5 7 trillion us dollar investment if we fund the sdgs the business and sustainable development commission notes that 12 trillion us dollars of new market opportunities and 380 million new jobs could be created yet we know that the developing world is losing a trillion dollars a year and according to the imf s latest report 15 trillion us dollars is held in tax havens and financial secrecy havens unctad notes that debt sustainability in developing countries is deteriorating fast and the imf states that as of last august 47 per cent of low income countries were in debt crisis or facing high debt distress human beings are suffering in too many poor countries high debts mean people don t eat people don t see doctors and communities are unprepared to deal with the havoc caused by tsunamis hurricanes earth quakes and other extreme weather events because of high unsustainable debts corruption a lack of public budget transparency tax evasion tax avoidance and bad trade deals countries are losing revenue and this real revenue loss becomes a theft from the poor according to unicef 22 000 children under the age of five are dying every single day if these numbers aren t frightening enough these same structural causes of poverty are also why we have extreme inequality why 80 individuals have more wealth than 3 5 billion or half the world s people people who live in poverty high debts illicit financial flows and these other structural issues are why the imf and unctad are warning all of us that we could experience another global financial crisis this frightens all of us as we ask whether debts are hindering development and whether high debts and financial secrecy are creating the conditions for another global financial crisis jubilee usa network whose members include the us conference of catholic bishops american jewish world service islamic relief the united church of christ the evangelical lutheran church the episcopal church and most mainline christian churches as well as the international debt and development network that coalesced around resolving debt crisis in the poorest countries of the world over 20 years ago is well positioned to respond to these issues because of our unique history in creating and supporting policies that successfully resolve unsustainable debts raise revenue promote good governance and prevent financial crisis and diminish poverty together we move forward global policies that address the root causes of poverty and inequality related to debt tax trade and transparency issues congressional quarterly cites the work of jubilee usa as some of the last truly bipartisan efforts in the united states in the 1990 s we began our work together to address inequality and finance development by addressing the global debt crisis working with governments around the world together we won two great debt relief and financing initiatives to address global poverty and promote children s education and health the heavily indebted poor country initiative hipc and the multilateral debt relief initiative mdri because of these initiatives over 115 billion us dollars was won in debt relief to benefit some of the world s poorest countries because of that debt relief we know in sub saharan africa that more than 54 million kids went to school who never would have seen the inside of a classroom we know that school fees were cancelled hospitals were opened because of this historic initiative because of this relief and the international accountability laws that we won all of this money had to go into building social infrastructure former world bank president jim kim cites debt relief as one of the main reasons we saw sustained economic growth in some countries across africa it was out of these initiatives that concepts around achieving debt sustainability were born unfortunately as successful and important as hipc and mdri were we now realize that those solutions were not enough to entirely address the problem out of the 38 very poor countries that benefitted from the hipc and mdri initiatives 31 out of 38 again face debt distress financial crisis or unsustainable debts at this point only somalia is able to qualify for this existing process eventually two other countries may be able to utilize this process but for every other country in the world this door is now closed while the door is now closed for almost every country in the world on this process we acknowledge that it was only because of the political will of un delegates and their finance development and foreign ministries back home that this happened in 2016 we saw that political will again in the united states under the republican led us congress when a super bankruptcy process was created to deal with puerto rico s 72 billion us dollar debt crisis it was the first act of the us congress to stop predatory vulture funds after haiti s tragic earthquake we saw world leaders and the imf create a process to relieve haiti s debt just a few years ago we saw that political will again when the imf moved forward a debt relief process and innovative grant process to respond to the three ebola affected countries of guinea sierra leone and liberia we also see the us government and the g20 working to stop vulture funds promote sustainable development and prevent financial crisis with the operational guidelines for sustainable development political will mobilized again to create new contract clauses to stop predatory vulture funds now we need that political will again from all of us to ensure that debt is a vehicle for sustainable development not a hindrance to development and a cause of human suffering we need to make debt sustainable and restructurings predictable to stop another global financial crisis while the problems are great there are solutions we can move forward now in addis ababa in 2015 we gathered with heads of state our finance ministers and foreign ministers and we forged a consensus we forged a consensus more powerful and more important than the consensus we achieved for hipc and mdri we are halfway there we have a consensus already by comparison the hipc consensus took decades to achieve but we already have a consensus now we must focus on implementation we ve done it before we can do it again in the addis ababa action agenda we agreed 1 we must implement principles of responsible lending and borrowing promote good governance and public budget transparency this implementation costs nothing but would raise hundreds of billions of dollars a year it means exporting the laws we rely on for our domestic economies not implementing means corruption goes unchecked and the mozambique crisis situation which could have been prevented is just the tip of the iceberg 2 we created the first international agreement to stop vulture funds there is no way to separate the current economic condition of a g20 country argentina and its battle with vulture funds 3 while the important work and efforts of monterey foresaw the challenges of illicit financial flows the addis ababa action agenda was the first to define them and call for tax evasion and corruption to be curbed as a matter of development additionally curbing tax avoidance was also noted as essential for development and good governance i would offer one of the gifts of the financing for development process was that we all learned together how startling all of our economic losses are because of illicit financial flows and also legal tax avoidance 4 in line with the types of debt restructuring and bankruptcy regimes we rely on in our domestic economies and the doha and monterey agreements we agreed that debt restructuring must be improved to arbitrate debt comprehensively fairly and neutrally after the asian financial in the late 1990s we came close to implementing the sdrm or the sovereign debt resolution mechanism we were so close but it didn t move forward the next moment we saw global political will was after the global financial crisis of 2008 we have an agreement to move this forward we will we wait until the next financial crisis to build political will again 5 finally the addis ababa action agenda took aim at debt risks of small island development states sids and caribbean countries it is critical that we focus on this one area to help us leverage and grow political will with political will growing we can tackle some of the debt problems of the sids across the world many of these islands have poverty rates that range from 30 per cent to 50 per cent these so called middle income small islands are now facing crisis of the 25 highest debt per capita countries more than half are sids unsustainable debts mean that these small islands don t have resources to deal with the shock of a hurricane or a financial crisis that stops tourists from visiting their countries when hurricanes decimated caribbean islands in the last five years we saw countries like dominica and antigua and barbuda make debt payments within days of a hurricane ravaging their country it is imperative to move forward proposals that can restructure debt when countries face shocks or natural disasters we see the success of proposals like this when debt relief was successfully used as a crisis response tool for the three african countries hit by the ebola epidemic when disaster strikes when famine spreads and when economic crisis impacts the poor we need to be able to reevaluate these situations in line with our previous thoughts on improving debt restructuring and looking at chapter 9 and 11 styles of bankruptcy it seems the caribbean and sids could be good candidates for a regional or focused initiative this post hipc initiative could be an initiative with the high debt distress many caribbean countries and sids are experiencing it can utilize the principles of bankruptcy for a regional or focused mechanism when a disaster strikes a debt moratorium would allow breathing space and debt payments to be used for rebuilding this would also be a time to reevaluate debt sustainability and possibly trigger a bankruptcy restructuring process we ve done it before we can do it again we will do it again for small islands on a smaller scale we can test solutions that can build resilient sustainable communities address inequality and lift the vulnerable starting here we can build more political will to finally resolve debt crisis stop global financial crises and curb illicit financial flows we ve done it before we will do it again read more here
money for the next world view s if the â end of the worldâ is nearing where do you store your wealth people in the world â mostly the rich store their wealth in various places such as bank deposits company stocks government or corporate bonds properties and commodities but if the value of these assets is likely to get wiped out where do they hide their money â storing wealth in assets gives a return so that we can also call it an investment for an investment in asset we can have a periodic return in terms of interests or dividends or otherwise and a capital gain in terms of increased value of the asset world of gold when the world economy is nearing its end of the business cycle investors tend to buy gold we would see that people start shifting their investment from other assets to gold look at it from the flip side if you notice that the demand for gold is rising in the world you should know that the end of the world economy is closer itâ s because gold is worth in the next world as well as in this world let me elaborate the point since ancient times gold has been playing a central role in the economic world as a â medium of exchangeâ as well as a â store of valueâ during medieval times a nationâ s economic power was measured in terms of the stock of gold accumulation the world abandoned gold as a medium of exchange in 1944 but it continued to remain a â store of valueâ to date not only the private investors but also the central banks all over the world use gold as part of their stock of foreign reserves the largest stock of gold reserves which amounts to over 8000 metric tonnes is with the us while it accounts for more than three fourth of the countryâ s official foreign reserves therefore gold price movements in the us are important for the gold market in the entire world however about 50 per cent of the world demand for gold is for jewellery when the income levels of the biggest buyers of gold jewellery â particularly india and china grow then it also makes a difference to world gold demand and prices gold demand for investment accounts for about 40 per cent which is directly relevant to our discussion today the balance 10 per cent of the demand comes from the manufacturing industries which use gold as a raw material gold rush investment demand for gold usually moves in line with ups and downs in the world economy â the so called business cycles during the â goodâ times usually gold prices should decline because investors start moving from the gold market to lucrative bond and stock markets during â badâ times of the world economy gold prices should rise as investors move in the opposite directions investment in gold is safe during economic downturns at which investment in other assets such as bonds and stocks is bound to lose the investors who do their usual business cycle calculations foresaw the approaching global financial crisis in 2008 and started shifting their investment from bonds and stocks to gold this raised the demand for gold and pushed up the gold prices in the world prior to the financial crisis in 2001 a gold ounce was less than us 400 in new york but it increased gradually to over 1 000 by 2008 as the â gold rushâ mounted within the next three years gold prices doubled reaching a historically high price of 2 000 per ounce by 2011 when the big fellows move their investment to gold millions of smaller fellows panic and follow suit it created chaos in the currency markets stock markets and bond markets which collapsed as gold markets were sky rocketing the increase in gold prices prior to an economic crisis has been a typical scenario all the time in world history before the great depression in the 1930s gold prices started to rise before the world entered into a â stagflationâ stagnation plus inflation in 1973 gold prices started to rise in contrast as the world economy started to expand after the world war ii gold prices continued to decline until the early 1970s in the 1980s and the 1990s too gold prices continued to decline until the turn of the century and if gold prices are rising in the world then we should take a serious note about it if the upward trend in gold prices is a result of shifting investments from other assets to gold then the end of an economic cycle is just around the corner the irony is that the shift in investment itself makes the recessions faster and the end of the cycle closer present â end timesâ gold prices started to rise again during the recent past four years ago by the end of 2015 a gold ounce was about 1 000 one year ago by the end of 2018 it was 1 300 now at the end of 2019 it is 1 500 are the investors moving their investment into the gold market again when there is an excessive money growth particularly in the hands of â speculative investors â then it is a driving force behind investment demand for gold as well as for other assets this is where we find the roots of the current problem money has been growing much faster than the real economies driving the interest rates down even to negative figures â quantitative easingâ is the new monetary policy motto for the advanced countries because even their conventional monetary easing became ineffective the rich countries such as the us japan and the euro zone which have been experiencing slower growth since the time of the global financial crisis has been injecting money to stimulate growth in spite of recent fund rate hikes in the us to around 2 per cent the interest rates in the us remains historically low in the recent past at around 1 per cent the average interest rate in the euro area continued to remain at zero per cent over the past few years japan has driven its interest rates down to negative figures economics upside down the typical economics principles appear to be upside down now when we have excessive money we should expect inflation but there is no inflation when we have cheap credit we should expect more spending â spending for both consumption and production which would stimulate growth but there is no growth stimulus either the irony is that with excessive money borrowing is â rewardedâ and saving has a â costâ as a result of mounting money stocks private credit has expanded in billions and trillions a year the question is that where did that money go if it didnâ t stimulate consumption and investment they did go to asset markets â stocks bonds and gold it was indeed a lucrative business to borrow at low or negative rates with a â rewardâ and investment in assets driving the asset prices up in the world the problem was that it cannot continue forever without a decline in debt quality the global corporate bond market has experienced falling credit worthiness along with the increase in the money stock this means that the world economy is moving towards a â high riskâ zone then where is the safe haven for investors who would perceive that the world is approaching towards another financial crisis itâ s gold so thenâ letâ s move into gold which would protect our wealth in this world as well as in the next world after the crisis by the way there is a silver lining in the dark clouds even for the countries which do not have much investment in gold there are accelerated capital outflows from economic recessions in the form of foreign direct investment the countries that are prepared to capitalise on this will start accommodating the capital outflows and achieving higher growth the writer is a professor of economics at the university of colombo and can be reached at sirimal econ cmb ac lk

and cyber espionage against u s businesses to name just a few china has stepped up its domestic technology research aiming to decrease reliance on u s technology and project global leadership in a few

good the best rating in 20 years china s economic situation is different the downward pressure on the economy has increased announced a statement by the state media xinhua news earlier this month china is experiencing its slowest economic growth in decades and that pressure has partially fueled the need to come to a quicker trade agreement beijing is expected to strategically stimulate the

has maintained record highs waning gdp growth china s third quarter gdp growth of 6 percent annualized was its worst in more than 30 years economists know that the official national bureau of statistics gross domestic product growth gdp figure is inflated but the nominal 6 percent has become a psychological threshold that if breached could trigger political embarrassment mass investor sell off and widespread consumer panic china s annual growth figures have been falling for years this year beijing has been implementing economic stimulus measures mainly in the form of infrastructure spending but not with the usual gusto it has all but conceded that 6 percent plus growth may not be achievable going forward several think tanks investment banks and even the international monetary fund imf are predicting sub 6 percent chinese economic growth in 2020 salvaging all the growth it can is a key reason china has rushed to a preliminary trade deal agreement with the united states it desperately needs to keep factories open and goods moving beijing prioritizes blockchain strategy china has high ambitions for its state controlled digital currency earlier this year chinese communist

china is also believed to be readying a central bank digital currency whether blockchain can be a successful technology underpinning global payments is still an open question current blockchain technologies still have speed and volume limitations but if china becomes a technology leader in this space it could be a detriment to other countries china could bypass the dollar based global

governments transacting with this technology debt defaults becoming the norm chinese commodities trader tewoo group defaulted on its u s dollar denominated bonds in december becoming the biggest default by a chinese state owned enterprise soe since 1998 beijing has become more comfortable with debt defaults in recent years that s one way of describing the trend and perhaps a more apt description is that beijing is forced to accept more defaults simply because it has no other choice chinese companies have binged on debt for too long and regulators can no longer afford bailing out

by joseph salerno the flood of obituaries that noted the passing of paul volcker 1927 2019 last week have almost all lauded his achievement as fed chair 1979 1987 in reining in the double digit inflation that ravaged the us economy during the 1970s volcker was referred to as the former fed chairman who fought inflation here inflation tamer and a full fledged inflation warrior here and the fed chairman who waged war on inflation and led the federal reserve s brute force campaign to subdue inflation here mr volcker certainly deserves credit for curbing the great inflation of the 1970s however he also merits a lion s share of the blame for unleashing the great inflation on the us and the world economy in the first place for it was mr volcker who masterminded the program that president nixon announced on august 15 1971 which unilaterally suspended gold convertibility of us dollars held by foreign governments and central banks imposed a fascist wage price freeze on the us economy and slapped a 10 percent surcharge on foreign imports tragically by severing the last link between the dollar and gold volcker s program scuttled the last chance of restoring a genuine gold standard more than two years before nixon slammed down the gold window volcker the recently appointed undersecretary of the treasury for monetary affairs gave an oral presentation to nixon and his closest advisors on us balance of payments problems the presentation was based on a memo that the secret volcker group initiated by henry kissinger spent five months preparing among other things volcker recommended a continuation of capital controls to prop up the inflated dollar s overvalued exchange rate and a massive appreciation or revaluation of the currencies of less inflationary countries such as west germany placing the burden of adjustment to unrestrained us inflation on these countries volcker then planted the time bomb that would eventually detonate and seal the fate of the gold standard he suggested to nixon that if these measures did not work to sustain the pseudo gold standard of the bretton woods system a run on the us gold stock could only be avoided by unilaterally repudiating the postwar us pledge to convert foreign official dollar holdings into gold unfortunately the volcker group report summarily dismissed the alternative of raising possibly doubling the dollar price of gold i e devaluing the dollar which would have increased the value of the us gold stock and facilitated the restoration of a genuine gold standard only a real gold standard could have halted and reversed the slow motion collapse that the international monetary system had been undergoing since the mid 1960s due to large and persistent us payments deficits driven by profligate dollar creation volcker however hated and wanted to get rid of the last vestiges of the gold standard and replace it with a fixed exchange rate system dominated by the us fiat dollar to further enhance the power and prestige of the us in international affairs according to volcker the stability and strength of our currency was important to sustaining the broad role of the united states in the world years later volcker revealed i have never been able to shake the feeling that a strong currency is generally a good thing and that it is typically a sign of vigor and strength and competitiveness one of his biographers intimated that volcker s longstanding regret at having been rejected for military service during world war ii because of his height was at the root of his single minded determination to maintain the supremacy of the american dollar as the world s premier currency indeed volcker struggled mightily to make the dollar appear strong even while rampant money printing to finance great society welfare programs and the vietnam war inexorably weakened it but volcker bitterly opposed raising the price of gold because he feared that open devaluation of the inflated dollar would not only diminish the status and reputation of the us but also reward people and countries he detested namely speculators in gold and gold producing countries such as the soviet union and south africa he especially loathed and wanted to punish president charles de gaulle and the french for embarrassing and discrediting the us by withdrawing from nato and exposing the weakness of the dollar by insisting on converting their dollars into gold in the face of us threats to remove military protection against the soviet union to add insult to injury de gaulle had sent naval ships to retrieve french gold when a full blown run on us gold stock appeared imminent in early 1971 volcker prepared a memorandum for the new treasury secretary former texas governor and master political operative john connally the memo contained three main proposals first countries with less inflationary monetary policies and therefore balance of payments surpluses such as west germany and japan would be imposed upon to substantially appreciate the value of their currencies thereby encouraging us exports and stifling its imports while sparing the it the embarrassment of openly devaluing the dollar second volcker recommended a preemptive strike against gold in the form of a cold blooded suspension of gold convertibility volcker s final proposal was a temporary wage price freeze as one of volcker s biographers characterized his motivation e wanted america to act preemptively to avoid appearance of defeat at the hands of currency speculators emphasis added secretary connally bought into volcker s program when a severe dollar crisis struck a few months later he used all his substantial political wiles to persuade nixon of the merits of the volcker plan then fed chairman and nixon advisor arthur burns for all his erroneous monetary ideas and policy failures was convinced that gold should play at least nominally a central role in the international monetary system in fact fter nixon took office burns proposed to end the balance of payments problem by increasing the official price of gold which would have effectively devalue the dollar in burns s view this would maintain gold as the anchor of a fixed exchange rate system an outcome that volcker would have detested not surprisingly burns was troubled by volcker who he thought had given a stupid reply to nixon about raising the price of gold burns also recognized and bemoaned volcker s influence over connally somehow poor and wretched volcker never knowing where he stood on any issue had succeeded in instilling an irrational fear of gold in his tyrannical master whom he tried constantly to please by catering to his hatred of foreigners particularly the french unfortunately burns had badly underestimated volcker and had mistaken his tact and strategic compromising for vacillation and indecisiveness as his biographer noted volcker admired john connally s social skills and had learned much from the master politician he preferred to equivocate qualify and risk being branded a poor communicator rather than feign certainty in the end the wily connally volcker axis prevailed over the politically naïve burns burns s biographer clearly recognized volcker s political cunning in winning over nixon the president decided against burns paul volcker convinced him that suspension was inevitable and that delay would only create financial chaos perhaps more important nixon realized if he announced the move as part of a new economic package he would appear to be acting decisively to take charge of the crisis making as volcker put it the devaluation of the dollar into a political triumph which was no mean feat thus it was that volcker s memo was used as the basis of the new economic policy that was hammered out by nixon and his advisors including volcker at camp david and announced in nixon s fateful sunday address to the nation one obituarist listed volcker s great public accomplishments thusly he was the point man at the treasury department in 1971 who managed the dollar s untethering from gold he quelled the double digit inflation that took root in the u s in the late 1970s he helped guide the country s response to the 2008 financial crisis unfortunately this list grossly overstates volcker s public accomplishments because it does not reveal the causal connection between his vanquishing the last remnants of the gold standard and the ensuing inflation of the fiat dollar whose supply was then subject solely to the decisions of bureaucrats eagerly seeking to please their

obinna chima fitch ratings has revised the outlook on nigeria s long term foreign currency issuer default rating idr to negative from stable but affirmed the country s rating at b this comes about two weeks after moody s another global rating agency also changed the country s outlook from stable to negative in a statement obtained from its website yesterday fitch explained that the outlook revision on nigeria reflected the increasing vulnerability from the current macro policy setting raising risks of disruptive macro economic adjustment in the medium term amid continued real appreciation of the naira it noted that nigeria s medium term economic outlook was subdued fitch also projected an average gross domestic product gdp growth of 2 4 per cent for the country between 2019 and 2021 this it stated would be well below the b median of 3 4 per cent and the five year average demographic growth rate of 2 7 per cent the prospects for supply side fiscal and exchange regime reforms that could tackle the major constraints for nigeria s credit profile are weak as reflected by the record in recent years emerging rivalries within the ruling apc party possibly sparked by early dissensions over the 2023 succession to president buhari could hamper policy making it stated it stated that nigeria s current account ca balance has shifted to deficit from a long standing surplus pointing to deteriorating macroeconomic imbalances and adding to external vulnerability fitch anticipated that the ca in nigeria would record a deficit of 1 6 per cent of gdp in 2019 its second weakest level in 24 years after a surplus of 2 6 per cent in 2018 fitch forecasts the ca deficit will moderate to an average of 0 7 per cent of gdp in 2020 2021 it stated general government gg debt remains on an upward path while particularly low fiscal revenues and structural shortcomings in public finance management pfm constrain the sovereign s ability to support a rising debt burden the gg debt revenue ratio is particularly high at 333 federal government fgn debt 777 in 2019 and will rise close to 400 per cent fgn debt 922 in 2021 well above the forecast b median of 248 per cent gg debt will exceed 30 per cent of gdp fgn debt 24 in 2020 trebling in a decade and up from 25 per cent fgn debt 20 in 2018 which was already its highest level since the restructuring of the paris club debt in 2004 weaknesses in pfm are illustrated by rising monetary financing a large and uncertain amount of government arrears and a multitude of contingent liabilities on which transparency is poor net cbn claims on the fgn soared to an all time high of three per cent of gdp in august equivalent to annual fgn revenues significant arrears continue to undermine the viability of the power sector despite large injections of funds by the cbn and the budget authorities domestic arrears of ngn3 4 trillion 2 of gdp according to preliminary estimates are being cleared through the issuance of promissory notes this amount does not capture pension and wage arrears reportedly owed by different tiers of government the rating agency added according to the rating agency a sharp devaluation of the exchange rate under the current policy framework could stoke macroeconomic volatility and significantly weaken some of nigeria s key credit metrics including its gdp per capita in united states dollars and its share in world gdp the substantial real appreciation of the naira over the last year appears uncorrelated with macroeconomic fundamentals and is set to continue driven by high inflation commodity terms of trade have deteriorated somewhat and will decline further weighed down by lower oil prices fitch argued that risks stem from the central bank of nigeria s cbn policy of attracting portfolio investments in its short term open market operations omo bills through high yields and hedging instruments offered to non resident investors at low cost despite a wide spread between the naira and dollar interest rates it put the value of non resident holdings of the cbn s omo bills as at the end of august at 17 billion the central bank has recently barred non bank residents from participating in the omo market and separately imposed a floor on bank loan to funding ratios to support credit growth low non oil fiscal revenues are a key credit weakness and are unlikely to improve significantly in the medium term in light of the slow progress on fiscal reforms public finances are highly dependent on hydrocarbon revenues which account for 45 per cent of gg revenues and are exposed to risks of disruption to production from vandalism or other force majeure affecting nigeria s aging oil infrastructure break even oil prices are high at around 144 barrel on our estimates and a 10 change in oil prices around our baseline would affect the budget balance to the tune of 0 5 per cent of gdp the global rating agency predicted a stable nigerian oil production volume of 2 14 million barrels per day mmbpd including condensates over 2019 2021 against a 2019 budget assumption of 2 3 mmbdp and a 2020 budget assumption of 2 18mbpd the agency also projects brent oil prices to average usd65 barrel in 2019 fgn budget usd60 usd62 5 barrel in 2020 fgn budget usd60 and usd60 barrel in 2021 fitch projected inflation would average 13 per cent between 2020 and 2021 from 11 3 per cent in 2019 well above the forecast b median of five per cent the acceleration will be driven by a host of recently enacted policy measures which will compound price pressures from exogenous cost push factors these measures include the upcoming raise of the vat rate significant salary increases following the 66 7 per cent hike of the minimum wage in april as well as the recent closure of land borders to foreign trade and tightening restrictions on fx financing for a wide range of imports it added
time for another round of predictions byron wien was once among the most famous investment strategist in the world and he co authored the seminal book soros on soros the 87 year old has largely faded from public view but resurfaces from time to time and his annual list of ten surprises always gets headlines last year his list extended to 14 and wasn t released until early january we hope he s back for another edition soon but in the meantime let s have a look at how he did this year the weakening world economy encourages the federal reserve to stop raising the federal funds rate during the year inflation remains subdued and the 10 year treasury yield stays below 3 5 the yield curve remains positive would this have really been a surprise he was right that they stopped but didn t see the total reversal ten year yields peaked at 2 7 in january of last year and the yield curve did invert partly because of no further rate increases by the federal reserve and more attractive valuations as a result of the market decline at the end of 2018 the s p 500 gains 15 for the year rallies and corrections occur but improved earnings enable equities to move higher in a reasonably benign interest rate environment the s p 500 is up 28 year to date largely because of fed cuts and continued multiple expansion earnings haven t improved traditional drivers of gdp growth capital spending and housing make only modest gains in 2019 the expansion continues however because of consumer and government spending a recession before 2021 seems unlikely these all start to tie together and get back to the fed cutting rates consumer and government spending were certainly the drivers of gdp growth but housing was a tailwind as well the better tone in the financial markets discourages precious metal investors gold drops to 1 000 as the equity markets in the united states and elsewhere improve gold never dropped more than 10 below the year opening level of 1280 instead fed and other central bank easing boosted it to 1480 the profit outlook for emerging markets brightens and investor interest intensifies because the price earnings ratio is attractive compared to developed markets and historical levels continuous expansion of the middle class in the emerging markets provides the consumer buying thrust for earnings growth china leads and the shanghai composite rises 25 the brazil equity market also comes to life under the country s new conservative leadership the shanghai composite is up 22 year to date and the bovespa up 34 great calls march 29 comes and goes and there is no brexit deal parliament fails to approve one and theresa may arguing that a change in leadership won t help the situation remains in office a second referendum is held and the u k votes to remain this is all wrong but it s certainly a reminder of how uncertain brexit was going into the year and how hard it is to predict the future the dollar stabilizes at year end 2018 levels and stays there throughout the year because of concern about the economy the federal reserve stops shrinking its balance sheet which is interpreted negatively by currency traders the flow of foreign capital into united states assets slows because of a softer monetary policy and a lack of need for new capital for business expansion the dollar was stable but the fed expanded its balance sheet and it hasn t hurt the currency at least not yet the flow of foreign capital into the us has been relentless this year the mueller investigation results in indictments against members of the trump organization closest to the president but the evidence doesn t support any direct action against trump himself nevertheless an exodus of trump s most trusted advisors results in a crisis in confidence that the administration has the people and the process to accomplish important goals there certainly wasn t an indictment against trump congress however with a democratic majority gets more done than expected particularly on trade policy progress is made in preserving important parts of the affordable care act and immigration policy a federal infrastructure program to be implemented in 2020 is announced no infrastructure plan was announced but it finally looks like usmca is going to get done growth stocks continue to provide leadership in the u s equity market technology and biotech do well as a result of continued strong earnings value stocks other than energy related businesses disappoint because of the slowing economy this was close to perfection growth certainly led the way and tech stocks had a sensational year value stocks disappointed but energy stocks were trashed geopolitical tensions increase iran continues to destabilize the middle east and kim jong un fails to live up to his north korea denuclearization promises secretary of state pompeo and national security advisor bolton make statements indicating the united states may take pre emptive action in both places thereby causing one of several sharp market sell offs but in spite of hostile rhetoric the united states does not go to war with anyone as we approach the 2020 election trump s tough talk on some issues like trade works however and leads to successful diplomatic negotiations on national security north korea was fairly low key this year this is a reminder that fears about the area were higher in early 2019 in desperation china engages in ambitious infrastructure programs to bolster its economy china grows at 6 5 real but the increased debt causes concern around the world and has a negative impact on the renminbi kinda right china announces we want to be the world leaders in free trade it sends envoys around the globe to negotiate better bilateral trade terms in order to offset the losses from the ongoing u s disagreements joint ventures in which foreign companies control the majority share are initiated in all sectors from industrials and autos to raw materials as china s influence around the world becomes greater the u s further isolates itself china s strategy has been to preserve and strengthen the multilateral system not to make bilateral deals but the rest is arguably right the european central bank is forced to restart quantitative easing in response to a defiant italy a weakening germany and brexit thwarting expectations that brexit would bring the rest of europe closer together italy realizes that it can break all fiscal rules without any fear of punishment from the e u as a result the italian economy falls into recession debt spreads surge and the ecb is forced to liquefy the system again the ecb certainly went back to bond buying but italy wasn t a big factor and the big surprise might be that no one is flouting the fiscal rules overall if you just isolate his market predictions and ignore his ideas on how we get there and the political talk he did very well us chinese and brazilian stocks all crushed it this year he was off the mark on gold but i ll look forward to what he has to say about 2020

more clarity and more questions emerged over the weekend about the terms of the u s china trade deal which warrants an update to this preliminary assessment published on friday the deal is pretty good for what is seems to accomplish that may sound like fingernails on a chalkboard to those more interested in preventing trump from gaining traction with claims that he won the trade war than they are interested in actually ending the trade war the deal is pretty good because it reduces business uncertainty confirms that the administration realizes its approach was unsustainable and by formalizing terms to resolve the variety of issues that frankly distract attention from the most difficult problems in the relationship creates needed space to shift focus to the genuinely challenging matters that of course refers to the challenge for technological preeminence and its attendant considerations industrial policy technology subsidies development and proliferation of standards related security issues and the impact on this race for primacy on commercial and strategic outcomes so what was agreed upon in a nutshell washington agreed to cancel tariffs on about 160 billion of imports from china which were scheduled to take effect yesterday keep in place the 25 percent tariffs currently imposed on about 250 billion of chinese goods rather than increase them to 30 percent as was scheduled and reduce tariffs from 15 percent to 7 5 percent on about 110 billion of chinese products relative to what was looming higher tariffs on all imports from china these terms should be welcome news to most consumers workers businesses and investors in the united states and china and throughout the world the specter of an escalating tariff war with all the commercial uncertainty that portends is no longer casting such a large shadow on the global economy that s good relative to the way things were 18 months ago we are still torso deep in costly taxes about half of the value of u s imports from china remain subject to a 25 percent tax as opposed to an average tariff of about 2 percent in june 2018 and about one fifth of the value of those imports remain subject to a 7 5 percent tax as opposed to an average tariff of about 2 percent in june 2018 presumably those tariffs are considered leverage and will be lowered or removed if and when beijing demonstrates that it has held up its end of the bargain yes it s true that u s tariffs are taxes on u s consumers and businesses which may raise questions about their value as leverage on beijing but the fact is that taxes on u s purchasers dissuade purchases from chinese producers so while the chinese aren t paying the taxes those taxes are reducing demand for chinese products after all something in the administration s approach made beijing agree to the phase 1 deal beijing made no explicit commitments to reduce the retaliatory tariffs it imposed over the last 18 months but it did agree to purchase over the course of the next two years 200 billion more goods and services from the united states than it purchased in 2017 the value of u s exports of goods and services to china in 2017 was about 185 billion so the pledge to purchase 200 billion more is very significant an average annual increase of 45 percent which is first unheard of for a large economy and second strong confirmation as if it were needed that china s is not a market economy realistically it is hard to imagine how the chinese economy can absorb that much in two years but then again maybe u s companies will jack up their prices by a factor of five or ten u s goods exports to china year to date through october 2019 are down about 16 percent from where they were in the january october 2017 period roughly translated that means that u s exports to china are down about 25 billion from the pre trade war period despite reports that this deal does nothing to make amends for lost market share suffered by u s exporters as a result of the trade war a 200 billion aggregate increase in exports over two years would certainly seem to more than make up for the average financial losses incurred by u s firms so far however those u s export gains most likely would come at the expense of other countries exports as chinese buyers divert their purchases from other suppliers in line with beijing s demands and that of course would have ripple effects throughout the global economy including a likely reduction in demand for u s exports in third countries so what other commitments did china make to give trump cover to begin lowering u s tariffs remember what started this whole trade war thing in june 2018 the president first imposed tariffs as a result of a formal investigation conducted by the u s trade representative s office under section 301 of the trade act of 1974 which found fault with a variety of chinese practices including intellectual property theft cyber intrusions discriminatory indigenous innovation policies forced technology transfer requirements and other related items but ever since then the focus of negotiations has been on tangential issues such as market access in china trade balances currency practices pretty much everything except those objectionable ip and technology practices well to my surprise the agreement worked out and summarized by the white house friday includes commitments from china to undertake effective measures to curtail prohibit and punish some of the kinds of forced technology and intellectual property transgressions that the united states wants resolved beijing also agreed to refrain from directing or supporting outbound investments aimed at acquiring u s technology it also agreed to fix problems that have created non tariff barriers to u s agricultural products in china such as circuitous licensing practices and opaque sanitary and phytosanitary requirements china also committed to open wider and more transparently its financial services markets to allow more competition from u s banks insurance companies and brokerages it also made certain commitments to ensure that it doesn t intervene in currency markets in a way that suppresses the value of the chinese yuan to secure a trade advantage and importantly the parties agreed to create a mechanism that ostensibly will allow for rapid hearing adjudication and hopefully resolution of disputes skeptics of the deal are quick to point out that in the provisions regarding intellectual property rights enforcement and disavowal of forced technology transfer beijing didn t agree to anything they hadn t already agreed to or weren t already doing as a result of obligations under previous agreements that may be true but beijing s and washington s definitions of forced technology transfer to use one example have been very different historically if this agreement includes a broader understanding by the chinese of the term forced it will be a step in the right direction beijing s pledge to stay away from backing or promoting technology acquisitions by state owned enterprises is a nice gesture that amounts to very little considering that u s policymakers are already ramping up scrutiny of these kinds of deals as required under the new foreign investment risk review modernization act it s something that u s policymakers are intent on scrutinizing and frankly protecting sensitive u s technology in a systematic and transparent way is far superior to levying tariffs and encouraging divestment commitments on currency of course have nothing to do with the impetus for the trade war this is perennial gripe that should be of very low priority on the u s list of concerns time will tell whether beijing actually makes good on these commitments and whether the administration will work hard to address the outstanding issues but for now and probably through the 2020 elections new or higher u s tariffs on imports from china seem to be unlikely of course we will have to endure 25 percent tariffs on half of our imports from china and 7 5 percent tariffs on about one fifth but the uncertainty that has racked markets for over 18 months is likely to abate this deal for all its shortcomings is an agreement to not escalate the trade war there s some value in that right the united states and china are locked in a race for technological preeminence which raises all sorts of strategic and security concerns that can no longer be treated with indifference technology bestows first mover advantages with significant commercial and strategic implications as 2020 progresses the u s debate over china policy should shift focus away from tariffs and trade measures to the broader strategies tactics and domestic measures needed to stay on top in the race for technological supremacy this article by

washington a wave of debt in emerging and developing nations has grown faster and larger than in any period of the last five decades and could end with another crisis the world bank warned and if the wave breaks it could be more damaging since it would engulf private companies in addition to governments at a time when economic growth is sluggish according to a new report that covers four debt surges from 1970 2018 the size speed and breadth of the latest debt wave should concern us all world bank president david malpass said in a statement clearly it s time for course corrections he added the world bank and international monetary fund have been sounding the warning about growing global debt for years but the latest report is even more stark and turned up the volume on its calls for governments to take steps to prevent a debt crisis imf chief kristalina georgieva on thursday said developing nations in africa especially need to strike the right balance between financing development and a manageable debt level the imf reported that total global debt rose to 188 trillion at the end of 2018 equivalent to nearly 230 percent of the world s economy the world bank report highlights the striking debt surge in emerging and developing economies which is the largest fastest and most broad based in emdes in the past 50 years after declining during the 2008 global financial crisis amid very low borrowing costs in just eight years since 2010 debt in these countries climbed to an all time high of roughly 170 percent of gdp or about 55 trillion much of the growth was incurred by china equivalent to more than 20 trillion but beijing also has become a large lender for low income countries the report warns that the current debt wave could follow the historical pattern and culminate in financial crises in these economies especially if interest rates spike or if there is a sudden global shock better debt management improved tax collection flexible exchange rates and tighter fiscal rules to manage spending could help avert a crisis and soften the blow if one occurs the world bank said towering though it may seem the latest global wave of debt can be managed malpass said but leaders need to recognize the danger and move countries into safer territory in terms of the quality and quantity of investment and debt sooner rather than later his imf counterpart georgieva in a blog post thursday repeated her concern about the massive increase in commercial borrowing in africa accounting for 70 percent of the ballooning of debt she urged governments in the region to find a balanced approach to managing debt and development africa is seeking to find the right balance between financing development and safeguarding debt sustainability between investing in people and upgrading infrastructure between long term development objectives and pressing immediate needs she said

along the docks in havana the streets are quiet where thousands of people disembarked from cruise ships on a daily basis the port now lies empty a quick stroll away in the almacenes de san josé crafts market maría hernández watches a handful of tourists browsing the aisles of this vast restored 19th century warehouse hoping they will pause at her stall for the past nine years she has been selling a range of goods decorative plates coffee mugs vintage car magnets and che guevara keyrings she welcomed the influx of people from the united states after the normalisation of relations with cuba in december 2014 without doubt when the cruise ships were here it was much better she said now after further tightening of us sanctions against cuba under the trump administration she has only seen one ship in the past month but it wasn t just the tourists in the cruise ships independent travellers also came she said and now there are fewer of them as well the future is uncertain she admits but she s hopeful that she ll see the visitors from the us again hernández may remain optimistic but this year has been a troubled one for cuba as the island was further sucked into the whirlwind policy making of the trump administration causing increased economic troubles throughout 2019 perhaps the tornado that touched down in havana in january should have been taken as a portent of things to come despite these problems it has also been a year of landmarks the cuban revolution reached its 60th anniversary and the island s capital was spruced up for its 500th birthday party in november which included the first ever state visit from the spanish royal family garlanded with christmas decorations the city looks festive potholed streets have been repaved and dilapidated buildings have been renovated the bustling shopping district by calle galiano was lit up with an extensive light installation and luxury hotels continued to open not all of the work was completed in time for the anniversary celebrations but the remaining scaffolding gives a sense that habana vieja is undergoing an extensive facelift yet beneath the scrubbed up surface people in the city and across the island are bracing themselves for an indeterminate period in an economic limbo view image in fullscreen cubans await the arrival of a cruise ship bringing tourists to havana in 2017 photograph adalberto roque afp getty images the most recent blow to the island announced in october was the stopping of commercial flights between the us and the regional cities of cuba from early december last april the us rolled back its people to people educational travel permits and prohibited cruise ships from calling into the island these measures further deflated tourism after a surge that saw some 1 5 million people coming from the us including cuban americans visiting family in 2017 driving overall numbers to 4 7 million visitors however after a year of donald trump s presidency the numbers began to decline and in 2019 tourist numbers have only just reached 4 million marta rodríguez who runs a casa particular b b in the vedado neighbourhood of havana emphatically shakes her head of grey hair and gives an exaggerated thumbs down when asked about this year she has lived in her second floor flat for more than 30 years and has been renting out a room since 1999 she charges 15 19 a night but she also has to pay a monthly tax of 26 whether or not there have been any guests in addition she cares for her husband who has alzheimer s he receives a pension of 300 pesos around 8 50 a month so the business has been a lifeline for them over the past few years she welcomed plenty of visitors from the us we were happy up to a certain point with obama she said but noted that some cubans were worried that the new relationship wouldn t last and it didn t with trump rodríguez s situation has worsened every day he squeezes a little more it is much more difficult to get things everything has been complicated although many tourists come through havana the entire island will feel the pain of these recent measures the ending of regional flights will force cuban americans visiting family and independent travellers to drive or take coaches to places such as santiago de cuba the island s second city some 12 hours from the capital or they will simply decide not to go the island s regional cities had shared in the tourism boom santiago de cuba had become a stop on cruise ship itineraries while on the opposite side of the island viñales transformed itself from a sleepy town to a gastronomic destination now these developments are also under threat in addition the economy has suffered from venezuela s reduced oil production and tightened sanctions in part as punishment for cuba s support of the regime of nicolás maduro by the autumn this caused long waits at the fuel pumps prices overall have risen and people are complaining of shortages of foods including chicken and coffee rodríguez claims her outgoings have more than quadrupled explaining that a bit of ham that cost around 50p last year is now 4 55 the government gave state employees and pensioners some 2 75 million people a pay rise this year but the cost of goods is eating away at modest increases and price controls have been implemented view image in fullscreen a queue outside a havana shop which only accepts us dollars for its products photograph alexandre meneghini reuters these problems are further exacerbated by the two currency system cubans in the state sector are paid in cuban pesos cup while tourists and people working in the private sector use the convertible peso cuc which is pegged to the us dollar that it was meant to replace nearly two decades ago with one cuc worth 24 cup the end of the cuc appears to be a step closer as the government announced some initial reforms including the banning of use of cuc at cuba s airports once the cuc is gone the island would use cup and us dollars in the meantime there will be less money to change as the measures introduced in april also curbed the remittances people in the us can send to cuba from an unlimited amount to 1 000 per person every three months all of this amounts to a huge challenge for miguel díaz canel who succeeded raúl castro as president in april 2018 despite his attempts to communicate with the public even going so far as to appear on the current affairs television programme mesa redonda roundtable in september to discuss the economic situation there is a sense that the president has not clearly articulated the country s direction through these problems right now they seem to be responding and maybe that s all one can expect them to do says michael bustamante assistant professor of latin american history at florida international university in miami while this period seems to indicate that the reforms that started under raúl castro are over it is not a return to the special period the island suffered after the end of the soviet union while certainly a shock to the system and a grave one at that this is not of the same kind of scale says bustamante cuba today has investment partners elsewhere hopes that the trump administration would not undo the obama normalisation were misplaced the relationship has really been torn to threads says bustamante trump s real concern is south florida although cuban americans there have a wide range of views about us policy toward the island according to bustamante the republicans have calculated that the support of the hardliners will be enough to deliver the votes they need to win this key state in the 2020 presidential election and so it stands to reason that we haven t seen the last of the escalatory measures as november 2020 approaches although times are tough to rodríguez they are not as bad as the 1990s previously it was very hard there was nothing she recalls but now other countries want to trade with cuba she remains hopeful that tourism will

conflict over trade dominated the economic headlines in 2019 so it s surprising that the year ended with significant progress on three trade agreements conflict over trade dominated the economic headlines in 2019 so it s surprising that the year ended with significant progress on three trade agreements each tells a different story about the outlook both for the global economy and for relations between nations as well as the deal struck between the united states and china last week the trump administration won agreement from the democrats for changes to the revised trade deal with mexico and canada that is now almost certain to be legislated on the other side of the world a meeting of asean officials set a date of 13 march 2020 for signing the regional comprehensive economic partnership agreement whether recalcitrant member india decides to participate or not rcep which was intended to include the 10 asean nations plus china india south korea japan new zealand and australia was originally conceived as a fairly limited agreement lowering tariffs on non controversial items but has been transformed since negotiations began in 2012 into a sweeping economic agreement that includes services the digital economy foreign investment intellectual property and supply chain management the phase one deal between the us and china gives the lie to president donald trump s bold tweet in early 2018 that trade wars are good and easy to win the us agreed to this partial settlement because the trade war was imposing an unacceptably high cost on the farmers who were crucial to trump s 2016 victory china s share of us soybean exports for example had plunged from a peak of more than 70 to just 5 the deal delivers the us farm sector some gains potentially at the cost of other suppliers including australia and brazil it also halts what threatened to be a major escalation in the tariff war and includes the partial rolling back of some tariffs the motives for the us led trade war were always mixed including a desire to narrow the us trade deficit a belief that china was competing unfairly because of the role of the state in its economy china s appropriation of us technology and a more general strategic competition between the long established and the newly rising powers the deal includes some additional as yet unspecified technology protections but otherwise leaves these issues untouched while failing to address the underlying us concerns the deal is entirely one sided with all the concessions being made by china it reflects the us administration s belief that it will win a better deal exercising its muscle over trading partners on a bilateral basis rather than through the world trade organization the deal includes a dispute resolution mechanism which is ironic given that the us forced the wto s trade dispute appellate body to shut down last week by vetoing all appointments of new judges as the terms of existing judges expired the new replacement for the north american free trade agreement by contrast is consistent with wto rules while trump damned nafta during the election campaign describing it as the worst trade deal the us had ever signed the updated deal reached with canada and mexico in may was more of a tweak than a rewrite canada and the us agreed to some opening of their dairy markets while motor vehicles are required to have 75 of their content made in the trade zone to qualify for tariff free trade up from 62 a new requirement is that between 40 and 45 of a vehicle s components must be made by workers earning at least us 16 an hour which is about three times the going rate in mexico there are new chapters on intellectual property and digital commerce which are broadly similar to those in the original trans pacific partnership agreement that the trump administration rejected these chapters largely reflect the interests of us technology firms the democrats and us unions were persuaded to support the deal by the creation of a panel to vet mexico s adherence to labour standards and by strengthened environmental standards mexico s objections to the monitoring of its labour standards may yet undo the deal while the labour clauses reflect a new us protectionism the deal shows that the trump administration the democrats and the us labour movement all accept that wto consistent agreements which make it easier to trade can be in america s national interest the rcep trade agreement which doesn t include the us shows that the flame of free trade remains ablaze in the asian region details have not yet been released but it s understood that 95 of goods traded across a region representing almost a third of the world economy would eventually be tariff free the investment chapter originally asked members to state which sectors of their economies would be open to foreign investment with everything else assumed to be restricted the latest version requires countries to specify which sectors are restricted with everything else assumed to be open to foreign investment the chapters on trade facilitation and services are designed to reduce the bureaucratic barriers to businesses trading and operating across borders india s decision in november to withdraw from the agreement was a blow to the aspirations of its advocates who had hoped that it would gather enough momentum to offset the rise of protectionism in the us and elsewhere india which has had a formal look east policy to strengthen relations with asia was close to concluding the rcep deal but got cold feet over fears that chinese firms would prove too competitive for their indian counterparts despite postponing a visit to india japanese prime minister shinzo abe is still working to persuade indian prime minister narendra modi to change his mind the growth of trade has been fundamental to the dynamism of asian economies over the past two decades and rcep is calculated to bring fresh energy to regional commerce at a time when trade flows globally have been flagging besides its purely economic significance rcep has strategic importance japan and south korea have been using trade restrictions as weapons in their dispute over the extent of japanese contrition for wartime atrocities rcep would put a stop to that by binding both to a new open trading framework a formal regional trade agreement that ties japan and china also strengthens economic bonds otherwise vulnerable to nationalist disruption above all rcep shows that asean is not simply a marriage of convenience among disparate but geographically proximate nations asean has been the driving force behind rcep forging what is likely to become an important component of the institutional architecture of global trade this is being achieved at a time when trade liberalisation has been confronting its greatest threat in 80 years david uren is an honorary associate at the united states studies centre at the

democratic socialism is currently the main alternative vision to transforming capitalism and as such we need to take it seriously despite our deep disagreement with it by democratic socialism we mean the idea that by using the two legs of the organised labour movement the trade unions and a socialist party in government we can walk step by step towards socialism socialism is defined as a society dominated by either nationalised or cooperative ownership of the means of production and workers representation when it comes to management of these economic units the general strategy of democratic socialism can be summarised briefly the idea is to campaign for an electoral victory of a socialist party based on an economic program of partial re nationalisation of a limited number of key industries and the creation of a wider sector of solidarity economy formed by cooperative or municipal companies that can guarantee more de centralised workers participation in tandem with electoral activities democratic socialists encourage the support of working class or social movement organisations outside of parliament in order to have an economic power base to put pressure on both capital and government once the party is in power the strategy needs to create a dynamic between a structural institutional changes decreed by the government which creates more space for the participation of working class organisations so called non reformist reforms and b pressure from below to defend and extend these spaces an example could be to enact banking sector reforms which limits the scope of financial speculation and tax avoidance and at the same time gives common ownership enterprises preferential treatment when it comes to commercial credits while this happens on the governmental level trade unions in companies that might try to undermine the reform by threatening to disinvestment will have to increase the pressure on management the material improvements of workers lives and the strengthening of trade unions are supposed to create greater unification within the working class a kind of jumping board into socialism there are two hearts beating in this project we see many comrades fed up with the social isolation of so called revolutionary politics becoming attracted to the practical and strategical debates of the democratic socialist project they can be intellectually invigorating these comrades might have come from classic anarchist or otherwise revolutionary organisations or they might have been politicised during the horizontal but ineffectual and often self referential social movements of the anti globalisation or occupy era we understand the urge of these comrades to make a difference and to think about short medium and long term steps towards social change we can see many fellow working class people who feel the limitation of trade union activity and who hope that labour in government can turn trade unions into powerful workers organisations again we want to fight for the hearts and minds of these comrades then there exists the usual careerist swamp within these organisations from dsa podemos to corbyn s labour the in fights and power games the direction of the democratic socialist project in the uk is not primarily determined by its political outlook but by its class composition the new labour left is composed of three main forces a segment of ambitious and perhaps precarious professionals who feel that according to their educated status they should have more say in society they also want a good life for the working class but their approach is technocratic learned people and progressive experts are supposed to decide how things are run not the bankers and the parasitic elite they form an alliance with the second main force the union bureaucracy the union apparatus allows the new professionals to speak in the name of the workers and the union bosses can extend their power into the political class the third element are the most marginalised parts of the working class who ve had to suffer from years of benefit cuts and sanctions labour under corbyn gave them hope but the party machine will end up instrumentalising their victim status we could write a long list of points of disillusionment with corbynism which took place even before the election disaster the second leader of the party s hard left wing john mcdonnell felt obliged to publicly whitewash the war criminal tony blair people who voted with blair to invade iraq are presented and hosted as left candidates such as the mp david lammy activists at the 2017 party conference learned that momentum could be used as a disciplining arm enforcing that delegates wouldn t vote on contentious issues such as a brexit referendum experiences in local party branches are largely dominated by tedious petty power plays and boring formalities during the winter 2019 20 it turned out that the only thing that corbynism has been able to re nationalise is the fringe left as we witness one of the biggest wave of working class protests from ecuador chile sudan to iran the left in the uk was completely focused on whatever corbyn or johnson were saying on tv the national narrow mindedness would have become worse if labour had entered government would any democratic socialist have supported unruly working class mobilisations such as the yellow vests or the protests in iran under a new and fragile labour government we can try to adorn corbynism with all kind of radical looking paraphernalia and woke memes from acid corbynism to luxury or literal communism but in the end it s a party that promises us a minimal minimum wage increase free broadband and slightly less austerity but then our focus here is not to argue about utopian visions but to point out the internal shortcomings of this political strategy 1 this is not a historic phase for social democracy historically social democracy developed during phases of economic upturns based on a relatively strong national industrial production capacity what we face now is an economic crisis and an internationalised production system this limits both the scope for material concessions and for national economic policies secondly social democracy primarily became hegemonic in post revolutionary situations social democracy was based on large organisations within the working class and a ruling class that allowed workers political representation in order to avoid revolutionary tensions left communists never get tired of repeating that the establishment of the nhs was not a result of labour party reformism but of tory cold war counter insurgency to avoid large scale social discontent after the war again this is not a situation we find ourselves in today the main point for us to stress is we face harsher conditions of struggle than democratic socialism prepares us for we can t bypass the day to day confrontations with bosses and their violent lackeys democratic socialism tends to overemphasise the autonomy of government politics in the uk the labour left portrays the thatcher government and their wicked policies as the source of evil neoliberalism whereas it was the global crisis in the mid 1970s which forced all governments to attack the working class you cannot vote your way out of this 2 current democratic socialism ignores the capitalist character of the state democratic socialist strategies are based on the assumption that the state stands above capitalism and could intervene in it as a politically neutral form historically the state emerged as the violent arm to impose and secure class relations e g through enclosures vagrancy laws and the military expansion of markets the state appears as a neutral force that is only there to look after law and order and the wider organisation of society but law and order means primarily that the property relations which are the material basis for the exploitation of the working class are maintained by making us citizens the state disarms us as a collective class force state politics separate the sphere of social production from the sphere of social decision making we are supposed to produce the world but apart from casting a vote every four years have no say in how the world is run materially the state apparatus depends on the continuous exploitation both through taxation and as an employer 3 current democratic socialism misreads the relationship between the market and capitalism democratic socialists think switching from private to public state ownership will be the antidote to capitalism they see no contradiction therefore between a big state and socialism despite the fact that state intervention regardless of where it is on the political spectrum has always played the fundamental role in expanding enforcing and defending the market the process of industrialisation itself required state ownership and central economic planning last but not least in order to enforce order against the emerging industrial working class during this phase it didn t matter if the left or the right was in government large scale state planning was required by the social situation and was not a political choice furthermore the idea that cooperatives and national state ownership go hand in hand is not verified by history the big decline of cooperatives in the uk didn t happen under thatcher but during the ascent of national economic planning and concentration in the manufacturing sector during a 1960s labour government the competition between companies the market form or the formation of monopolies is just a surface appearance of the underlying class relations so it wouldn t be enough to just smash the monopolies a more fundamental change is required we can see this when class relations are in crisis when workers organise mass strikes and hit the streets the state no matter if it is left or right has no problems suspending the free market in these situations to repress and maintain class society for example after the oil shock in the 1970s it was no contradiction that the indira gandhi government nationalised the mining and banking sector in order to prevent economic collapse inscribed socialism into the indian constitution obtained the support of the communist party and launched the most brutal attack against striking railway workers and other working class insurgents during the state of emergency 4 democratic socialism in practice avoids the structural weakness of the working class and focuses on professionals the current proponents of democratic socialism know that class struggle is at a low ebb but instead of focusing on building organised cores within the class they largely focus on the recruitment of professionals and activists while previous revolutionary upheavals like 1968 questioned the role of the intellectual expert the current generation celebrates it this is very obvious for parties like podemos or syriza but also valid for the so called labour surge most of the new party members have a higher education and are living in metropolitan areas materially the new left intelligentsia reproduces itself as the neoliberal self that they pretend to criticise hardly any of them are organic intellectuals forged in working class existence and struggle most of them survive by creating a social media and academic persona whose opinion is valued on the marketplace whether you read the alternative models of ownership by the labour party advisers bastani s luxury communism or srnicek s inventing the future the prime agent is always the figure of the well educated and networked activist unfortunately this forces our intellectual democratic socialist comrades to chase their own tails there is a big blank space when it comes to the question of how their well meaning ideas will be enforced and implemented who will enforce workers participation if workers are seen as people who are only able to engage in political discourse during election times the absence of a strategy rooted in the working class then leads to the creation of a trite and kitsch icon of the people a mass of honest victims who need cultural belonging and political leadership 5 democratic socialism s understanding of workers participation is formal and therefore flawed we criticise socialist thinkers for seeing state planning as essentially opposed to capitalism though confronted with history most of them would hasten to add that nationalisation and planning have to go hand in hand with the democratisation of the economy the problem is that their understanding of workers participation is largely formal e g proposed in the form of workers shares in enterprises union delegates on company boards or voting rights when it comes to management decisions the aforementioned class background of many of the new socialist intelligentsia also contributes to their limited understanding or actual trajectory of what workers control would require their understanding of class is largely economistic defined by the fact that workers all depend on wages this understanding of class doesn t focus on the actual form of the production process and its hierarchical division of labour intellectual and manual workers productive and reproductive work etc in their policies their understanding of ownership of the means of production and democratic participation of workers is formal just because workers or trade unions hold 50 or 100 of shares doesn t mean much if workers are still forced to do the drudge work the whole day performing only a limited amount of tasks this won t allow them to have an understanding of and therefore say in how a company or sector is actually run you might give them a vote on a company board but it will be those who have a greater overview and more time due to their professional status as intellectuals engineers scientists etc who will make the decisions the vote will be reduced to a fetishised process to confirm the experts monopoly of knowledge as we have seen in history workers survive the worst defeats inflicted by the class enemy but the deepest and longest lasting traumas are inflicted when oppression and exploitation is enacted in their own name didn t the workers state of the stalinist regime formally belong to the workers too a mere change in government or a shift from private to state property would not touch the core of what defines working class its power and disempowerment 6 the trade unions and the workers party are not the working class the democratic socialist perspective relies on the idea of a transmission between the working class and the state through the interaction of the two main workers organisations the parliamentary party and the trade unions this perspective relies on an idealistic or pre historic view on trade unions as the democratic representation of the class plenty of historical examples labour tuc in the uk in 1926 or the 1970s cc oo in spain after franco solidarnosc in poland after 1981 pt cut in brazil recently etc demonstrate that during the heat of struggle waves the trade union government connection becomes the heaviest blanket on working class initiative during the last years that we ve been shop stewards we ve gotten quite a bit of insight into the internal mechanisms of two major trade unions both loyal to the labour party democratic socialism s idea that these organisations will be the main force in keeping the government and its enemies under pressure is totally illusory more often than not we can see how the party and the union leadership instrumentalise workers struggles for their own ends e g the recent symbolic strikes at mcdonald s in london were called by the union leadership at a time where it suited the labour campaign circus but actually undermined the organising work of the union s own organisers many of the proposed reforms that labour wanted to bring in e g sectoral collective bargaining and contracts would facilitate economic planning for the bigger capitalists and strengthen the central trade union leadership s grip than actually boost workers independent power the regional and sectoral contracts in germany are the best example 7 focus on the political arena saps energy the leadership of democratic socialism tends to try and bypass the mundane and laborious problems of power relations between workers and capital and instead focuses on the electoral leap but these tend to be leaps forwards and backwards the governmental politics of 21st century socialism in latin america chavez morales lula etc and their structural weaknesses have created widespread disillusionment the subjugation of the syriza government in greece to the system and its representatives has closed down rather than opened up spaces for the class movement against austerity the internal power fights within podemos or momentum has created cynicism and burn out by adopting a lesser evil voting strategy and calling for people to vote for macron to avoid le pen the left undermined its own position in the anti government rebellion of the yellow vests the media hype of corbynism the engagement with electoral tactics etc diverts focus from daily struggles for working class self defence there is also a misunderstanding of parliamentarianism just because a political party is composed by workers doesn t make party politics and the parliament a form of working class politics parliamentarianism is the exact opposite of working class politics as it is based on individual citizenship not on collective and practical relations this is true for national parliamentarism as much as for the parliamentarianism light in the form of radical municipalism campaigning for independent candidates in local elections that some activists propose the best example for the limits of local electoral politics can be found in the us the election of militants of the black liberation movement after its decline in the late 1970s meant that in towns like chicago and baltimore black mayors had to enforce austerity and anti poor policing measures in the 1980s which further weakened and divided the movement while stabilising the system who better to enforce cuts against black urban poor but a black mayor while history provides us with ample examples cracks also appear in the present if we look at barcelona en comu the citizen platform that won the local elections in barcelona and provided the new mayor colau we can see various moments of tension between the local working class and the new citizen friendly local government e g when the local government acted against the striking airport and metro workers in 2017 comrades in spain also noticed that the redistribution of local politicians wages by platforms like barcelona en comu did not primarily benefit rank and file organisations but created a larger number of so called movement jobs a new layer of professional activists with all the contradictions of professionalisation one outcome of these tensions with the local working class is that barcelona en comu tries to channel some of the discontent into catalan nationalist waters as if catalan independence had much more to offer working people than yet another dividing line within our class we will now face the same problem in scotland 8 parliamentary power and state power are two different things let s assume a socialist party manages to get into government the idea of a parliamentarian road towards socialism neglects the fact that taking over government and having state power are two different kettles of fish there is little analysis of the actual material and social class structure of the state administration public servants army and its independence from parliamentary democracy for example despite changes to its outer form the material core and trajectory of the russian state apparatus i e social strata of people employed in carrying out state functions has reproduced itself from the time of the tsarist regime through the bolshevik revolution stalinist terror glasnost to putin if we want to look closer to home even the revered tony benn had to understand as secretary of state for industries in the mid 1970s that the struggle with the right wing of the labour party was child s play compared to the struggle with his own civil servants 9 by focusing on the national arena and the state democratic socialism tends to misjudge the global relation of capital let s assume that a socialist party not only manages to get into government but also manages to dominate the state apparatus due to the fact that the nation state is the core element of the strategy for democratic socialism the project is immediately confronted with the global nature of capital higher levels of taxation and other impositions will result in capital flight amongst global companies democratic socialism accounts for this by for example proposing alliances with smaller enterprises as a kind of national productive united front against global corporations and finance we ve seen time and again how this necessary alliance shifts the ideological viewpoint towards left patriotism and other bullshit if a labour government would actually try to increase taxation and redistribute assets the most likely outcome is a devaluation of the pound and an increase in inflation due to a trade deficit which cannot be counteracted easily given the composition of agriculture energy sector general manufactured goods the new labour left leadership trained in political activism and speech and aided by their influence amongst the union leadership will be the best vehicle to tell workers to give our labour government some time to explain that international corporations have allied against us and that despite inflation workers should keep calm and carry on wage struggles will be declared to be excessive or divisive or of narrow minded economic consciousness we have seen how for example the chavez government in venezuela organised the urban poor against strikes of teachers who demanded higher wages denouncing them as greedy and therefore responsible for other workers poverty 10 class struggle doesn t develop gradually democratic socialism s focus on electoral campaigning and official union organising results in a misjudgement of how class struggle develops historically class struggles developed in leaps and bounds in a much more complex dynamic between organising and external forces and factors the belief that class struggle is based on step by step organising and mobilising often results in leftists putting stumbling blocks in the way of future waves of struggle in the short term getting community leaders or your local mp involved or relying on the trade union or party apparatus in order to mobilise or encourage fellow workers might seem beneficial what initially seemed a stepping stone turns out to be a stumbling block for example middle men who get in the way of things or illusions in symbolic forms of struggle the challenge is to find step by step forms of struggle which help in the moment but don t pose problems long term in their need to create a transformation of workers action controlled strikes etc on the ground into economic pressure to support state policies socialist organisers tend to become scared of the often chaotic and seemingly spontaneous character of struggles they run the danger of misunderstanding that these situations of breakdown of normality are precisely the situations where workers have to face up to their responsibility to re organise social reproduction these moments are the necessary learning curves and laboratories where we actually change things and ourselves to stifle this means killing workers participation 11 democratic socialism and its fear of uncontrolled class struggle becomes its own gravedigger as it weakens the working class activity necessary to defend it the fact that the biggest socialist party in history the german spd first agreed to support the german government in the 1914 war efforts and oppressed workers revolutionary upheavals after the war was not a betrayal it was part and parcel of a long term strategy to gain governmental power and to re shape the national economy to which workers revolutionary adventures posed a risk after having weakened workers self activity the spd was then confronted with a global crisis in 1929 which limited a national economic strategy the combination of these two factors a working class weakened by government tactics and powerlessness vis à vis global capital resulted in the spd opening the door for the most brutal reactionary turn in 1933 another example is the social democratic government under allende in chile in 1973 it shows us that the relationship between working class movements and left governments is more complicated than the often mechanistic picture of force movement and container stabiliser government we can see that the initial social reforms were introduced by a right wing government which failed to contain class struggle when allende took over he had a hard time keeping workers and poor peoples struggles under control struggles which might well have been encouraged by the incoming left government allende feared that the local upper class and international imperialist forces would use the social turmoil as an excuse for intervention industrial unrest also created shortages which threatened to destabilise the government further international price developments in particular of mining products curbed the scope for material concessions towards striking workers allende s policies towards the working class unrest which ranged from concessions to military repression undermined and literally disarmed the working class when the local military backed by the cia went in for the kill the resistance was already weakened this historical example seems irrelevant for the sitation in the uk or the us today but once we look beyond short term goals of electoral tactics we still face the same fundamental dynamics 12 strategy starts from actual struggles and actual potentials and difficulties imposed by the social production process we need strategies and we need organisation we have to start by analysing the real conditions and relationships of our class how is production organised today how is it organised beyond company or national boundaries how are we as workers divided from intellectual labour and knowledge and how can these divisions be overcome how can we make use of the fact that workers cooperate along supply chains often using modern communication technologies in order to develop new forms of transnational organisations of struggle how does our class lead its struggles today where do we use the potentials of modern production and where do we fail to use them in our favour how do the struggles in the bigger workplaces and industrial sectors relate to areas or regions where workers are more atomised we have to create a dynamic between industrial and workplace power and the inventiveness of working class people to organise their survival be it in the form of workers cooperatives hack labs squats or self run community projects within these struggles we have to develop the organisation and strategy to imagine a coordinated take over of the central means of production their defence and their socialisation beyond national boundaries this will not happen on day x of our choosing this will happen with the increasing disfunctionality of this system to which our own struggles for survival contribute democratic socialism and its strategies will not be adequate for the vastness harshness and joy of what lies ahead for the working class we have seen that the strategy of democratic socialism clashes with the two main historical forces in capitalism firstly by focusing on the national arena it clashes with the global character of capital and secondly by reducing the question of exploitation to the question of whether workers work under private or public command their strategy clashes with the substantive discontent of the working class a socialist government would be forced to weaken its own power base in order to deal with the continuing discontent keep calm and give your workers government a bit more time in the long run this creates disillusionment and the material basis for a reactionary turn these are the historical lessons
between elections the interest group process along with media and social media coverage is a key way in which citizens can seek to communicate with their mps and other representatives and to influence government policy makers for the 2018 audit of uk democracy patrick dunleavy considers how far different social groups can gain access and influence decision makers how democratically does this key form of input politics operate and how effectively are all uk citizens interests considered theresa may at the cbi s conference picture the cbi via a cc by nc sa 2 0 licence how should the interest group process operate in a liberal democracy elected representatives and politicians should recognise a need for continuous consultation and dialogue with different sections of the public over detailed policy choices procedures for involving interest groups in decisions affecting them should cover the full range of stakeholders the resources for organising collective voices and political action in pressure groups trade unions trade associations non governmental organisations charities community groups and other forms should be readily available in particular decision makers should recognise the legitimacy of autonomous collective actions and mobilisations by different groups of citizens the costs of organising effectively should be low and within reach of any social group or interest state or philanthropic assistance should be available to ensure that a balanced representation of all affected interests can be achieved in the policy process decision makers should recognise inequalities in resources across interest groups and discount for different levels of organisability and resources policy makers should also re weight the inputs they receive so as to distinguish between shallow or even fake harms being claimed by well organised groups and deeper harms potentially being suffered by hard to organise groups other aspects of liberal democratic processes such as the manifesto doctrine that elected governments should implement all components of their election programmes do not over ride the need to consult and listen in detail to affected groups and to choose policy options that minimise harms and maximise public legitimacy and consensus support since policy makers must sometimes make changes that impose new risks and costs across society they should in general seek to allocate risks to those groups most easily or able to insure against them between elections the interest groups process generates a great deal of useful and perhaps relatively reliable information for policy makers about preference intensities by undertaking different levels of collective action along a continuum of participation opportunities and incurring costs in doing so ordinary citizens can accurately indicate how strongly they feel about issues to decision makers actions like sending back a pre devised public feedback form writing to an mp supporting an online petition to the government or tweeting support for something are cheap to do and so only indicate a low level of commitment joining and paying membership fees to an interest group or going to meetings shows more commitment and gives the group legitimacy and weight with politicians going on strike or marching in a demonstration indicates a higher level of commitments still a well organised interest group process will allow for a huge variety of ways in which citizens can indicate their views from a somewhat elderly 2006 study we know that in the uk there were over 7 800 interest groups registered by group directories for the field jordan and greenan demonstrate that business trade associations many very small were by far the greatest number followed in numerical terms by professional groups and learned societies campaigning and pressure groups ranked only fifth of their category types some individual groups have grown very large memberships in the millions of hundreds of thousands such as the uk s few trade unions which have coalesced into a few very large membership bodies or the national trust or royal society for the protection of birds figure 1 the distribution of uk interest groups in 2006 source jordan et al 2012 table 7 2 p 151 jordan greenan 2012 figure 4 1 p 82 p 92 as figure 1 shows four out of five interest groups recruited individual members and three out of five only recruited individuals so their significance for elected politicians was based quite heavily on their size those that can engage the participation of almost all the people in a given occupation or role will carry especial weight as with the well organised medical professions over time the numbers of non business groups with individual memberships grew substantially from 1970 to 2006 as the table part of figure 1 shows campaigning groups grew slightly more in numbers than the general trend the remaining fifth of interest groups all of them business or trade associations only recruited firms as members and a further fifth recruited both firms and individual members here legitimacy may be based on what proportion of a given industry or type of business are engaged with bodies claiming to represent them often rather divergent voices have claimed to represent business interests as in the long run rivalry between the confederation of british industry cbi which represents big firms and operates in a politically neutral corporatist way and the institute of directors which is more eclectic and more right wing some industries are dominated by a single interest group like the national farmers union which in the past achieved enormous insider influence with the relevant whitehall department other looser coalitions of different interests like the roads lobby of transport operators construction companies and motorist organisations can achieve a similar dominance however at any given time an ecology of interest groups operates with different organisations competing for attention and encouraging their members to commit more resources or time to the group trade unions have been the biggest and most continuous losers since the 1980s their membership numbers radically reduced with the decline of manufacturing industry and large firms numbers and unionisation rates held up better in the public sector but even there members became markedly less willing to go on strike in recent years meanwhile environmentally aligned groups and ngos non governmental organisations have flourished some big groups that shifted away from restrictive legacy modes of recruiting members to digital approaches have increased their size radically notably the labour party under jeremy corbyn but in the interest group world at large such effects have generally been smaller recent developments this area of policy making has been stable for many years with occasional fringe scandals a succession of which lead to the 2014 lobbying act this introduced an official register of paid lobbyists contacting mps in westminster and in touch with whitehall departments affecting commercial lobbying firms most together with some groups with developed governmental or parliamentary liaison operations the lobbying industry in the uk is estimated by some sources to be worth 2bn a year but still remains mostly self regulated especially perhaps in the new digital influencing areas the large data analysis and lobbyist firm cambridge analytica became a focus of controversy in 2018 in the usa and britain after it emerged that it had extracted a large amount of users personal data from facebook without their knowledge and used the information to construct sophisticated psychological profiles used to target voters in the trump campaign and used by a closely allied company to help the brexit leave campaign the firm fought a rearguard action against its critics but it had to close down when its uk chair was caught on video in a sting by a uk tv programme boasting of using illicit influence techniques to ruin the reputations of rivals to its clients with business clients drying up the firm shut its doors within a few days the chief executive attended two grillings by a house of commons select committee and official investigations continued at the time of writing critics argued that the incident shone a light on lax regulation of new influence technologies a conclusion that a commons select committee shared in a critical mid 2018 report on fake news and social media digital technologies could also play a role in allowing decision makers to elicit and cheaply incorporate mass public views the uk government re established an official online petitions site in 2015 where citizens can lodge proposals for issues to be reviewed by parliament any petition gaining 100 000 verified electronic signatures goes to the house of commons and supposedly gets a debate followed by a response very large numbers of petitions are started but most quickly fail to attract public attention only those that can generate around 10 000 supporters in the first couple of days have any effective chance of reaching the 100 000 target in the time allowed in 2016 thousands of petitions were started but only 10 reached the 100 000 threshold and four of these were denied a parliamentary debate however these initiatives can be influential in spring 2017 theresa may invited newly elected us president donald trump on a state visit to the uk a petition to ban him quickly attracted 1 86 million supporters although ministers said that they would ignore this the idea of a visit receded into the long grass until the summer of 2018 and when it did take place it was carefully organised to keep the famously touchy us president completely away from london and other uk cities where mass protests occurred strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats swot analysis current strengths current weaknesses british government ministers mps politicians and civil servants recognise the importance and legitimacy of a vigorous interest group process an open consultation process operates for all new legislation and government policy white papers and sometimes for statutory instruments where interest groups are battling against party a s manifesto commitments and especially where they are aligned with a rival party b they will face an uphill struggle to make any changes in the incumbent government s policies governing parties in the uk have a strong record of pushing through partisan commitments and just over riding the opposition of groups who do not support them the uk has no equivalent of the european union s formal reporting back of consultation outcomes ministers and civil servants commonly talk up any support their proposals secure while ignoring or belittling unfavourable feedback parliamentary processes including the consideration of legislation questions to ministers and select committee hearings connect strongly with the interest group process most legitimate or established groups can find mps to represent their interests or cause or to help from their position in the legislature however select committee inquiries access quite a restricted and biased range of recognised interests public involvement processes in the devolved scottish welsh northern ireland and london legislatures are generally far more systematic and inclusive there are sharp inequalities in the capabilities of different social groups to monitor policy proposals and to get effectively involved in official consultation and legislative processes the poorest and least socially resourced groups in british society rely chiefly on ngos charities and altruistic philanthropists to secure any research or campaigning on issues that concern them by contrast business interests have well developed government and parliamentary liaison units and ready access to professional lobbyists public relations consultants marketers and media experts giving corporations and well off elites inherent advantages that are hard to counteract uk decision makers are alert to the potentially excessive power of lobbyists and of well resourced groups best able to afford lobbyists and other organised and commoditised means of influence most if not all politicians discount heavily for the industrialised lobby power of business and other wealthy groups lobbying is regulated and any excesses in attempting to secure influence are frowned upon and quickly stamped out as the cambridge analytica case demonstrates lobbying in the uk has historically focused most attention on creating private links with civil servants and ministers exercised at early stages of the policy process and often carried out without transparency concertation of ministerial decisions and business interests have been fuelled by incidents like the hundreds of emails between news international and the private office of the responsible minister jeremy hunt during a take over battle he had to adjudicate in 2010 12 as the powers of the house of commons committees have slowly grown and coalition governments operated in hung parliaments in 2010 15 and 2017 present so more lobbying has focused on the legislature because mps and peers can work for outside jobs and take money from well funded interests there have been a succession of scandals around mps peers and even ministers not declaring interests for elected politicians what matters most is the vote power of groups which is a function of their size large membership groups are more influential than small ones the intensity of their preferences groups that care a lot outweigh apathetic ones and their pivotality giving more importance to potential swing groups who might shift support between parties shaping who wins there are inherent influence inequalities between groups but because they derive essentially from their role in the electoral process they are generally democratically defensible for politicians the realpolitik of the interest group process is that they appease groups whose support they rely on but they will cheerfully impose costs on groups normally opposed to them or too small or poorly organised to do them electoral damage both ministers and civil servants also routinely extract a good behaviour price for conceding influence to any insider group to remain influential the group must only express critical views moderately and privately at early stages of policy development before proposals go public they must normally mute any public criticisms altogether or tone them down to be non confrontational or expressed responsibly saturation media coverage and now social media coverage as well means that the risks for politicians in lightly or overtly deferring to powerfully organised interests have increased modern policy making has shifted more into cognitive modes of competition between rival coalitions of interests here the quality of evidence you can produce to back a case and sustain effective participation in policy debates counts for more than simple voting power or financial might a more deliberative interest group process has emerged which has evened up access to the policy terrain cognitive competition remains heavily influenced by resources and money wealthy interests can better afford to fund research and information gathering than groups representing the poor and powerless wealthy interests can also trigger more law cases in areas favourable to them and thus ensure that legal knowledge differentially develops in helpful ways future opportunities future threats the growth of social media and internet based modes of organising has radically lowered the information and transaction costs of organising collective actions in the last two decades and promises to continue doing so in particular large scale citizen mobilisations by spatially dispersed or functional groups for example patients affected by a particular disease or citizens with a shared specialist interest have become far more feasible and influential lobbying and public relations professionals have extended the techniques and services they use for commercial and other well funded interests so as to increasingly manipulate social media in expert ways a new and powerful data industrial complex has recently emerged as the leave campaign for the brexit referendum aptly demonstrated the mass emergence of clicktivism allows individuals to spontaneously signal their position on public issues on twitter facebook and other social media these micro donations of time and support mean that people get instant feedback on the popularity of their views and potentially linkages to like minded people this radically enhances the speed and granularity of the public s collective vigilance over policy making in liberal democracies however more critical citizen activist campaigners like alberto alemmano stress that clicktivism cannot be an end in itself but must be part of a wide armoury of modernised citizen engagement leading to real world engagement by increasingly delegating the job of representing diverse relatively powerless societal interests to ngos and charities and restricting their own participation to digital means well educated and altruistic middle class people have created another spiral in the further professionalisation of democratic politics groups that slip between the gaps of ngos concerns for example perhaps fathers for justice can lose out badly from this system their inexpert autonomous efforts to organise become ever more marginalised in the political world crowdfunding via the internet has increasingly emerged as a way that large and dispersed groups can fund previously difficult mobilisations the anti brexit lobbyist gina miller used this technique to back anti brexit candidates in the 2017 general election as did other satellite campaigns however her more famous supreme court legal case against the government was privately funded similarly open source techniques of organising can often help otherwise disadvantaged groups to operate more effectively in competition with business hierarchies the virulent tone of the brexit referendum campaign upset many charities the chief executive of the national council of voluntary organisations said he regretted they had not spoken out enough because of fear of running foul of the 2014 lobbying regulations plus being pilloried in the media in brexit policy development up to summer 2018 ministers and whitehall have seemed reluctant to bring in outside voices and groups have felt excluded despite their eu expertise according to jeremy richardson interest groups were keen to get involved in the brexit negotiations not least because they know a lot about the eu policy process but pro remain industry interventions were fiercely attacked by brexiteer politicians managing decision making consultations elections inherently give policymakers only a crude and infrequent idea of public opinion parties must aggregate issues together into programmes and manifestos citizens can only cast a single vote with no capacity to indicate which issues or policy commitment counts most with them nor can they express the different strength of their preferences on multiple issues so even politicians with a clear manifesto commitment to implement have just a direction of travel not a detailed route map for getting anywhere that works public consultation processes some linked to legislation or executive orders generate huge volumes of very specific information about how and why different interests are affected by proposed policy changes which will bear costs and which see benefits in them often the detailed information needed for effective policy implementation rests with trade associations firms trade unions professions ngos sub national governments or academia rather than in whitehall hence in any policy area there will either be a policy community that is strongly networked regularly influential and perhaps closed to outsider groups alternatively there may be a looser policy network linking the main groups that regularly comment on policy issues but with more weakly tied or changeable sets of participants a well organised civil society may seem to leave whitehall and ministers in a weak position and in the past some political scientists rather fancifully described a hollow crown that has resulted in the uk however ministers and civil servants do not assign equal weight to all actors in networks but instead demand responsible behaviours from those to whom they will listen such as think tanks business lobbies professions or expert academics insider groups have the ear of policymakers while more strident public and extreme voices are routinely discounted finally sophisticated opinion polling now allows both politicians and the public to regularly learn how different types of citizen feel about issues so the policy influence of public opinion as a whole has improved and magnified a lot of media and social media coverage and commentary also ensures that policy makers continuously get the message about which bits of their proposals are popular and with whom corporate power in the interest group process yet is the apparent diversity and pluralism of the consultation process just a misleading façade vladimir lenin famously argued that the liberal democratic state was tied by a thousand threads into doing things that owners of capital want and a concern about the privileged position of business in dealing with government extends widely amongst liberal authors too such as charles lindblom since businesses generate economic growth and taxes they have special salience in making demands on politicians and officials and as the journalist robert peston argued the wealthy will find a way to buy political power whether through the direct sponsorship of politicians and parties or through the acquisition of media businesses or through the financing of think tanks the voices of the super wealthy are heard by politicians well above the babble of the crowd we are more vulnerable than perhaps we have been since the nineteenth century to the advent of rule by an unelected oligarchy p 346 in a discussion for democratic audit david beetham drew attention to how dominant financial corporate sectors in the uk economy first caused the 2008 economic crash by forcing through rash financial deregulation but these same interests were then differentially rescued by unprecedented state bailouts by the biggest banks and to stop a wider decline quantitative easing by the bank of england propped up the asset values of the wealthiest groups in society via transfer pricing debt loading and shifting domicile the largest global companies have also effectively evaded corporation taxes and undermined the uk fiscal regime public disquiet and tax shaming mobilisations by online activists have dented this regime e g a consumer boycott forced starbucks into voluntarily paying nominal amounts of uk corporation tax and forced a rethink of previous pro multi national tax policies across the oecd competition between advocacy coalitions a more benign view of changes in the interest group process is given by the advocacy coalition framework acf this modern pluralist view argues that the key influences on public policies now are cognitive ones turning on empirical evidence research and cognitions old style big battalion groups like big corporations media barons and mass ranks of trade unions sought influence on the basis that they could mobilise adverse votes at the ballot box or unfavourable coverage by media commentators but most policy level influence now comes from a different process of cognitive competition where rational arguments and evidence chiefly sway policy makers not political self interest alone nor are the battles that matter fought any longer by single interest groups but rather by competing advocacy coalitions that bring together diverse clusters or networks of groups aligned on each side of the policy debate for example on tobacco policy a succession of nudge interventions by government followed up periodically by regulatory restrictions and new legislation have progressively strengthened the disincentives for smoking and curtailed passive smoking in the uk and figure 2 shows impacts in terms of falls in the number of smokers the apparently ascendant coalition here includes anti smoking charities the medical professions nhs authorities the health department in whitehall progressive local authorities who forced the pace of implementation many non smokers especially those adversely affected by passive smoking and so on figure 2 the proportion of men and women smoking in great britain 2000 17 source office of national statistics dataset 2018 the coalition fighting a rearguard action against smoking regulation includes of course the tobacco corporations front and centre plus some other aligned businesses pro freedom or libertarian think tanks tories opposing a nanny state and a diminishing minority of still enthusiastic smokers yet has the progress achieved in reducing smoking incidence over recent decades been fast and furious as defenders of the uk s policy apparatus might say or slow and often stalled how you assess the scale and speed of these changes will shape how effectively you think cognitive competition changes the dynamics of group competition conclusions nobody now claims that the uk s interest group process is an equitable one a position wrongly attributed to pluralists by their critics even common sense requires that we recognise there are big and powerful lobbies medium influence groups and no hopers battling against a hostile consensus democracy requires that each interest be able to effectively voice their case and have it heard by policymakers on its merits so that the group can in some way shape the things that matter most to them on the whole the first voice criterion is now easily met in britain but achieving any form of balanced deliberative consideration of interests by policymakers remains an uphill struggle business dominance is perhaps reduced by restrictions on lobbying and extra transparency from social media but it is still strong despite some shifts towards cognitive competition over policy solutions and towards more deliberative and evidence based policy making about

key point tehran is facing more pressure and the iranian people are angry the events of the last few weeks in iran indicate that the country may be in for a repetition of the events of 1978 that led to the toppling of the shah anti government protests in iran have reached a boiling point with the streets of several of iran s cities and towns reverberating with slogans demanding the overthrow of supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei one can hear echoes of the death to the shah slogans of 1978 79 in these frenzied chants security forces have repeatedly opened fire killing people by the dozens possibly by the hundreds in order to disperse protestors just as they did in the autumn of 1978 iran s economy is in a tailspin which is what triggered the protests it is in far worse shape today than was the case on the eve of the shah s fall when there was a severe economic downturn because of economic mismanagement and misdirection despite the oil boom of the 1970s the economic distress of the late 1970s was intimately related to the crony capitalism of the shah s regime that hurt the traditional merchant class symbolized by the bazar as well as the newly developing middle class it was no coincidence that the religiously observant bazaris bankrolled the movement led by ayatollah ruhollah khomeini that overthrew the shah the resemblances of the situation today with the last years of the shah s rule are uncanny the economic distress is in part the result of the economic sanctions especially on the sale of iranian oil imposed by the united states since may 2018 oil is the lifeline of the iranian economy and accounts for a quarter of the country s gdp and contributes about three quarters of iran s public revenue with oil exports slashed from 2 45 mbd to 0 26 mbd in the past year the iranian economy has gone into a severe recession world bank projections for 2019 indicate a negative growth rate of minus 8 7 percent in its gdp the iranian currency has fallen precipitately since the reimposition of sanctions with the unofficial rate plummeting to 135 000 to one u s dollar thus adding to the financial woes of the iranian public according to the world bank higher import prices from the devaluation are expected to push inflation back above 30 percent in the coming years as inflationary expectations spiral and consumer sentiment falls leading to once again a period of stagflation for iran despite the depreciation and drop in imports the reduction in oil exports is estimated to almost eliminate the current account surplus which is lower than the earlier sanctions episode as oil prices are almost half of the levels they were in 2012 13 2013 14 the economy s downward trajectory is also likely to put further pressure on the labor market and reverse recent job creation gains crony capitalism with religious foundations controlled by the regime and especially by the irgc controlling a large part of the economy and monopolizing certain crucial sectors has added to the people s economic woes especially since their combined budgets of these foundations account for over 30 percent of central government spending that benefits a small segment of the elite additionally according to world bank estimates the unemployment rate was over 12 percent as of april june 2018 with youth unemployment over 28 percent in june 2018 one can reasonably expect this to have climbed higher with the reimposition of economic sanctions in may 2018 that has had a tremendous negative impact on the iranian economy one of the byproducts of the iranian economic downturn was the decision in november to increase the price of gasoline on an average by 50 percent the iranian public had become accustomed to a heavily subsidized price of oil and its sudden increase by such a hefty margin acted as the trigger for the protests that broke out almost immediately following the announcement of this decision however these economic woes build upon the frustration generated by political repression the current protests as distinct from those of 2009 following the regime engineered re election of president mahmoud ahmadinejad have been spontaneous and largely leaderless no faction of the regime has been involved in the current demonstrations and thus they cut across the hardline moderate divide they also cut across class and ethnic divides with people of all classes joining in the protests and different ethnic groups the majority persians as well as the minority arab population of khuzistan participating as well initially largely motivated by economic factors they have now taken on major political overtones demanding the removal not only of rouhani and his government but of the supreme leader and the coterie of clerics around him as well the response of the regime s security forces has been swift and brutal with hundreds of unarmed protestors shot down in cold blood reminding observers of the events of 1978 in the lead up to the fall of the shah it seems that this brutality has had the effect of galvanizing the opposition to the regime just as it did in 1978 thus perpetuating the cycle of violence and resistance that reminds one eerily of the months preceding the shah s fall the major unanswered question now is will the current protests have the same result as those of 1978 or will the regime be able to suppress them with the use of brutal force it is difficult to answer this question with any degree of certainty especially because of a near total news blackout imposed by the regime the forces at the regime s command are not only well trained in suppressing dissent but they are also ideologically committed to the system of clerically dominated rule moreover their commanders realize that the fall of the mullah dominated regime could mean not only an end to their power and perks but to their physical existence as well this is the lesson they have absorbed from the fall of the shah which led to the systematic decimation of the officer corps that had been loyal to him they know they are fighting for their lives and not just for the perpetuation of clerical rule this explains in large part the ferocity demonstrated by the regime s security apparatus in suppressing the demonstrations this means that the regime is likely to survive in the short term but only in the short term its legitimacy has been irreparably damaged by the disproportionate and brutal use of force that it has unleashed on largely unarmed protestors hardly anyone in iran now buys the argument that the governing powers hardliners and moderates alike are either defending islam or the country against foreign enemies furthermore unlike in earlier periods of turmoil the regime does not have the surplus economic resources to buy off dissenters by offers of subsidies a practice that the regime had engaged in time and again when oil prices remained high and the volume of oil exports was high as well the drastic fall in the volume of oil exports has removed the financial buffer on which the government had depended earlier for its survival the regime may be able to survive this round of protests and demonstrations but both its legitimacy and its ability to hold on to power have been severely damaged eroding almost beyond repair its capacity to manage future rounds of protests there may not be a repetition of 1979 this year but the protests have surely paved the way for its reprise in the not too distant future mohammed ayoob is university distinguished professor emeritus of international relations michigan state university and

on december 16 the gross federal debt breached a new level to 23 1 trillion while the net debt after 401 billion of cash weighed in at 22 71 trillion the latter monstrous figure is notable because on june 30 2019 it stood at 21 76 trillion so what has happened in the last 167 days is a 948 billion increase in the uncle sam s net debt which amounts to a gain of 5 7 billion per day including as we like to say weekends holidays and snow days worse still not a single dollar of that gain got absorbed in government trust funds the treasury float held by the public actually rose by 953 billion so why in the world do the knuckleheads on bubblevision not understand where the spiking rates and ructions in the repo market came from the law of supply and demand is still operative and the us treasury is literally flooding the bond pits with new supply even at the bottom of the great recession uncle sam did not drain 5 7 billion per day from the bond market but nary a soul down in the imperial city has noticed this borrowing eruption at the tippy top of the business cycle which now teeters on borrowed time at a record 127 months of age instead this very day the congress is busily engaged in what is a fair approximation of abolishing the election process at the heart of american democracy peak trump the undrai david a stockman best price 12 72 buy new 43 07 as of 11 40 utc details we will address today s hideous impeachment gong show below but here we note that every talking head showing up on the screen today is claiming that the market can keep on bubbling higher because the pending impeachment of the nation s 45th president is a great big nothingburger au contraire it s real deeper meaning is that the washington end of the acela corridor is now morphing into a disruptive missile aimed right at the canyons of wall street of course the donald won t be convicted by the republican senate indeed the house impeachment resolution my never even be sent to the senate if nancy and her ship of fools conclude there won t be a real trial in the senate and therefore leave the resolutions sitting on the parliamentarian s desk as camera ready campaign fodder for 2020 but hey a government which can treat the supposedly solemn and extraordinary process of impeachment as a mere exercise in campaign theatrics is a government that has given the term dysfunctional an altogether new definition it means that the conduct of the actual business of the people s government has virtually ceased to be sure we would ordinarily consider a government that does absolutely nothing to be praiseworthy after all the route to prosperity does not extend through the halls of congress or the vast departments inside the beltway but stems from the genius of free enterprise and the exertions and inspiration of workers employers savers investors and inventors they require neither help nor superintendence from an activist federal government likewise a reticent government is all we really need for national defense the latter has been more than taken care of by the god created ocean moats which secure our shores and our already paid for nuclear deterrent which keeps distant foes at bay all the rest of the 900 billion of so called national security spending and the vast and unremitting washington machinations it funds are in behalf of empire not the safety and liberty of the homeland but the fly in the ointment is that several generations of washington politicians have turned the federal budget into a fiscal doomsday machine spending for both automatic entitlements and so called discretionary programs alike gushes higher pulling the public debt upwards as it goes with virtually no meaningful legislative action consequently the fractured and inflamed partisanship evident in today s demented proceedings has become the handmaid of the nation s impending fiscal catastrophe that is government must take positive and sweeping legislative action to brake the doomsday machine but james madison s checks and balances have always made large scale statutory enactments difficult while today s metastasized partisanship have made them well nigh impossible it is generally understood that the giant entitlements social security federal retirement medicare medicaid food stamps and the lesser income security programs are automatic permanently authorized payments that currently flow to upwards of 160 million americans and will continue to do so whether congress does its job or not but what needs emphasis is that the rate of growth is accelerating in effect it is busting loose from the growth rate of the faltering national economy which must finance these massive entitlements thus between 1987 and 2000 total federal entitlement spending soared from 358 billion to 778 billion or by 117 but during those first 13 years of greenspan s reign the fed s easy money was able to goose nominal gdp by 115 meaning that the entitlement claim on gdp remained constant at about 7 5 since then it has been off to the races as shown in the graph below during the last 19 years nominal gdp brown line doubled again but federal entitlement spending purple line tripled and it s claim on gdp rose from 7 5 to 11 0 what this means is that every year the legislative stalemate and inaction persists is another year in which the fiscal doomsday machine gathers even more momentum moreover the surge of beneficiaries behind the above divergence is by no means over the 80 million strong baby boom will continue to clamber on to the social security medicare welcome wagon at a rate of 11 000 per day until the end of the 2020s the graph below is dispositive the 39 7 million medicare and social security retirement too beneficiaries at the turn of the century are already more than 60 million which total will rise to 81 5 million by 2030 and 92 4 million by 2050 needless to say the rate of entitlement spending growth which has already broken loose from gdp will diverge to an even greater degree during the decades ahead quite simply the already baked in the cake demographics of american society guarantee that work force and gdp growth will continue to weaken even as the exploding retirement population gets ever older on average and therefore more costly to support nor is the automatic entitlement the only aspect of the budget threatening a further breakout in the turbulent twenties ahead mandatory interest on the debt is fixing to soar at quadruple the rate of the last 19 years owing to the math of debt and interest rates to wit the first 19 years of this century witnessed the full fury of central bank interest rate repression the 10 year u s treasury ust yield fell from 6 5 to a recent sub basement level of just 1 75 trumped a nation on t david a stockman best price 2 05 buy new 9 50 as of 06 30 utc details accordingly even as the federal debt erupted from 5 7 trillion to nearly 23 trillion or 300 during that period the interest expense of the us treasury crept up at a far more moderate pace thus interest outlays during q3 2000 posted at a 353 billion annual rate representing 6 2 of the 5 67 trillion of public debt then outstanding but during the next 19 years of explosively growing federal debt interest expense crept up to just 584 billion at an annual rate during q3 2019 representing but a 65 gain since the turn of the century here s the thing annualized interest expense in q3 2019 amounted to just 2 6 of the debt outstanding or barely one third of the 6 2 level registered in q3 2000 it goes without saying that this disconnect between the debt and its cost of carry was a one time fiscal windfall that has actually functioned to obfuscate the magnitude of the budget crisis gestating down below the top line yet according to the sheer math of the thing it can t happen again in the decades ahead because interest rates have already been pushed to sub economic and unsustainable levels by the fed and other central banks at minimum therefore interest expense will grow just as fast as the baked in the cake growth of the federal debt which is heading toward well in excess of 40 trillion by the end of the 2020s accordingly even at today s average yield federal interest expense will surge to 1 1 trillion per year during the next 10 years and a lot more when interest rates finally normalize growth of federal debt versus interest expense 2000 2019 finally even the so called discretionary part of the budget annual appropriations for defense and domestic programs has succumbed to a form of de facto automaticity to wit the imperial city has been so fiscally euthanized by the fed s gift of unending cheap money and massive monetization of the public debt that both parties are on the same side of the budgetary boat that is in favor of more spending with the gop neocons and hawks pushing defense spending skyward in trade for equivalent levitation of domestic appropriations as especially favored by the dems moreover the trumpified gop has developed a deathly fear of being blamed for another government shutdown which it falsely blames for its wipeout at the polls in 2018 so the gop has essentially joined a bipartisan conspiracy in favor of a rolling suspension of the federal debt limit and annual omnibus appropriations bills that are loaded with budget busting pork crazily the talking heads on bubblevision this am were making the absurd argument that there is smooth sailing ahead because congress just passed a 2300 page 1 4 trillion omnibus appropriations bill for the balance of fy 2020 even as it is in the midst of a partisan donnybrook on impeachment supposedly this means the government is still functioning no sweat well yes it is functioning but to literally blow the top off from even the tiny discretionary spending corner of the federal budget that until the donald came along was exhibiting a modicum of restraint no more the two year budget deal being sent to the white house will blow the budget caps for fy2020 2021 by 320 billion but even that isn t the half of it due to congress crooked self serving scoring rules budgetary caps become the basis for the outyear current policy baseline in subsequent years accordingly for fy 2020 the existing caps were supposed to cause total defense and non defense appropriations to drop by 125 billion from 1 244 trillion in fy 2019 to 1 119 trillion in fy 2020 this is shown in the solid black line in the chart below and also shown by the dotted black line is the convention for projecting 10 year baseline spending from the old fy2020 and fy2021 caps thanks to congress alleged ability to function in the midst of partisan madness however those caps have now been blown away and none have been enacted for subsequent years hence the baseline for discretionary spending in the outyears is now plotted by the dotted blue line the difference over 10 year a cool 1 7 trillion and you can believe that the bipartisan duopoly on capital hill will drive every dime of this increase right into uncle sam s trillion per year borrowing requirement even then they were not done as they honed

effective dates still if you can t repeal obamacare spending as the gop miserably failed to do in 2017 and 2018 why do you get to repeal these financing means and brag you have made a blow for america s taxpayers not only do these actions bury taxpayers deeper in debt they also guarantee that some day down the road even higher taxes will be imposed in order to finally stem the flood of red ink besides that 200 billion of the revenue loss buried in the omnibus appropriations bill is attributable to permanent repeal of the so called cadillac tax on ultra high cost gold plated mainly union health care plans which have a total cost of more than 30 000 per year that s right the bipartisan duopoly has now agreed to keep spending trillions over the next decade for obamacare but can t even see its way clear to tax the excess value of health care plans which cost about the same as the average annual wage among the 170 million payroll tax filers in the us nevertheless when you add 70 billion of other tax loopholes which were extended and the associated debt service cost the very functional congress at work this week blew a 500 billion hole in the revenue collections over the next decade to fit on top of the 1 7 trillion of added discretionary spending so the federal budget has indeed become a full bore doomsday machine there is not a scintilla of capacity or will on either side of the partisan divide to even brake its trajectory as shown below the publicly held debt is heading toward 150 of gdp a level which would crush what remains of us economic growth or encourage the fed to print so much money monetizing this exploding public debt as to virtually destroy the financial system in the process yet this gets us back to today s contretemps obviously the dem impeachment case is absurd the meddling in the 2016 election was done by the deep state intelligence agencies with the encouragement of partisan obama officials not the russians and ukraine s cesspool of corruption would not have smeared american politics in the slightest had washington not fomented a coup in february 2014 against a government it didn t like for being too friendly with its historic russian neighbor and suzerain so the donald had every reason of state to want the ukraine corruption investigated for crying out loud the prosecutor fired by biden has told exactly why it happened in early 2106 he had seized the property of the corrupt ukrainian oligarch and owner of burisma who had hired hunter biden and the son in law and chief of staff to the secretary of state john kerry then out of the blue wham he was removed from office at biden s command in exactly the quid pro quo manner uncle joe famously bragged about before an audience at the council on foreign relations so how much stench do you really need in your nostrils to recognize that the hunter biden led crew of fortune hunters in ukraine after february 2014 weren t on the up and up but actually the threadbare articles of impeachment arising from the stench of ukraine are not really about the donald s 25 minute phone call and purported quid pro quo at all the dems have adopted the posture that the american election process itself is imperiled by the nefarious meddling of russkies and other fureners and are focused not on governance but on this alleged threat to their ability to win office and hold power at the same time the gop has lost all sense of its fundamental missions in behalf of sound money fiscal rectitude free markers and homeland defense instead it s going full retard on its own fatuous version of the supposedly imperiled u s election process that s what the donald s insane wall on the mexican border and the gop s increasingly shrill anti immigration policy is all about it opposes more immigrants and brown people because it believes they will vote democrat and thereby deprive the gop of its rightful claim on political power needless to say two parties fighting over alleged existential threats to the very essence of american democracy is the very opposite of the nothingburger ballyhooed by bubble vision this am what the trump impeachment is really about is a brutal raw struggle for power that threatens the very survival of american democracy and which could end up in a hung 2020 election that would make the hanging chad ordeal of 2000 look like a walk in the park even then the fiscal doomsday machine will power forward unrestrained and these fools on bubble vision want you to buy the dip don t you dare peak trump impending crises essential info action

the white house and beijing have reached an agreement on a phase one trade deal with most of the last minute attention focused on agricultural purchases and tariff reductions among the key structural issues that may not have been adequately addressed is washington s concern about theft of intellectual property rights which according to president donald trump costs the nation us 600 billion annually an accusation denied by china many in america s security establishment also see china s aggressive actions as part of broader efforts to erode america s great power status thus the transfer of technology to china is viewed not only on its commercial merits but also as a potential national security risk the new agreement however has left unaddressed the tensions surrounding us restrictions on sales of hi tech equipment to china and its innovative ambitions as exemplified by its 5g initiative the ever expanding view of the dangers of technology transfer has blurred the debate over ipr protection underpinning us china technology competition is the recognition that innovation driven growth is central to long term economic development because many people can make use of the same idea broad dissemination of knowledge is beneficial notwithstanding recent disagreements over technology transfer the two countries have pursued similar growth objectives at comparable stages in their development using ipr protection as a policy tool towards that end the crux of the debate over ipr is the trade off between access to knowledge and incentives to innovate having reached the innovation frontier the us understandably wants a strong system to protect ipr if protection is too lenient ideas are essentially free and copying goes unchecked providing little incentive to undertake costly investment in new technologies instituting more stringent protection can help overcome this stagnation by granting monopoly rights to innovators yukon huang huang is a senior fellow in the carnegie asia program where his research focuses on china s economy and its regional and global impact more but such actions can also go too far with critics complaining that patents in pharmaceuticals for example have blocked entry of newcomers and raised costs excessively from china s point of view technology acquisition has driven its impressive growth from low to upper middle income status realising the importance of technological upgrading and its own limited capabilities in important sectors china has designed relatively lax ip laws to encourage knowledge inflows from abroad p while china has been much maligned for counterfeiting the key to its success has not been copying per se but rather how it has learned from ideas from overseas chinese companies such as e commerce giant alibaba and messaging app developer tencent have demonstrated that adapting foreign products for local use can be a springboard to true innovation in fact in certain sectors us companies are now returning the favour by imitating their chinese counterparts the major reason the us and china cannot agree on the appropriate strength of ipr protection is that they differ in their domestic innovative capabilities which are closely tied to their respective development levels because emerging economies rely on the innovations of advanced economies to grow multilateral agencies such as the un conference on trade and development and the world trade organisation have underscored the importance of cross border technology transfer to developing countries china has performed spectacularly in this regard using foreign knowledge both legally and questionably en route to lifting over 500 million people out of poverty since opening its economy although washington insists that china is no longer a developing country it ranks 64th in gross domestic product per capita and its innovative skills fall short of organisation for economic cooperation and development comparators differing political systems present yet another roadblock to mutual understanding us companies look out for their own interests and patents are primarily used to exclude others and safeguard personal returns this creates winners and losers producers gain monopoly rights driving up prices for consumers and forcing out competitors democracies must be responsive to these distributional effects and seek to balance the interests of various constituents jeremy smith jeremy smith was a james c gaither junior fellow with the asia program more in contrast china s authoritarian system permits much greater latitude to pursue longer term national interests without domestic political constraints china views ip as part of society s collective push towards innovation leadership for instance it sets explicit targets for the total number of patents bolstered by nationalistic support china is well equipped to weather resistance from the international community despite being seen as flaunting international norms china s technology acquisition strategy is not unprecedented others such as japan south korea and taiwan similarly disrespected ipr in prior decades but as their innovative capacities matured such practices were eventually abandoned nonetheless in the case of china many us foreign policy experts no longer see technology transfer as simply a matter of economic trade offs washington s brand of techno nationalism is exemplified by placing huawei and other chinese tech companies on its entity list and by strengthening foreign investment security reviews national security concerns add a whole new dimension that impose costs on both sides china misses out on knowledge transfers needed for growth and american tech companies lose profits needed to expand in light of such complexities the white house negotiation strategy misses the mark for two reasons first it began with a misguided view that it could use punitive tariffs to quickly force china to reform and has since pivoted to a phased approach a broad consequence of china s rapid development is that its institutions lag behind its economic weight fostering the sense that china is not a responsible stakeholder second because of differing developmental levels compounded by the dominant role of the chinese state the us and china have seemingly irreconcilable perspectives on the role of ipr and china s ambitions to become a technology power but the challenges of ip policymaking are common to all countries and security issues affect europe and others beyond the us china great power rivalry rather than pursuing a bilateral solution a wider forum is needed to discuss technology transfer in an era of rising global techno nationalism reaching a more robust political consensus may require something like the g20 format where a broader spectrum of interests is represented if china is to realise its tech ambitions it will be in its own interests to push for such an initiative this article was

washington cnn for the past year president donald trump has repeatedly ping ponged between claiming the economy is booming and blasting the federal reserve for not doing enough to support economic growth would be sooo great if the fed would further lower interest rates and quantitative ease trump tweeted on tuesday less than a week after the us central bank signaled it would be hitting the pause button on any more rate cuts going forward the dollar is very strong against other currencies and there is almost no inflation this is the time to do it exports would zoom the president campaigned on promises of 3 growth and is presiding over somewhat less than that with a final report issued friday showing respectable 2 1 growth for the third quarter but the economy is getting rave reviews with 76 of respondents in a new cnn poll conducted by ssrs rating economic conditions in the us today as very or somewhat good significantly more than those who said so at this time last year 67 this is the highest share to say the economy is good since february 2001 when 80 said so that s in part thanks to the fed s success in keeping the us economy running smoothly over the last year with unemployment hovering near 50 year record lows and the stock market hitting record highs nevertheless there are worrying signs business investment has fallen the last two quarters the first decline in three years according to the bureau of economic analysis manufacturing layoffs have ticked up since the summer and on friday us steel announced plans to close a mill near detroit and cut 1 500 workers in response the commander in chief has pushed unusual economic ideas including publicly pressuring the fed to cut rates to zero and even at times suggesting rates should fall into negative territory the fed however has shown no signs of taking trump s suggestions at the fed s final meeting of the year powell and his colleagues signaled they would be sitting on the sidelines for some time powell said the three rates cuts this year were key decisions that helped to support the economy which was showing signs of potentially tipping into recession over the summer the fed is basically saying things are cool we don t really want to change things we re going to sit this one out for the foreseeable future said robert frick corporate economist with navy federal credit union that means they ve done their job powell has himself argued it would take a lot for the fed to move in either direction next year we took strong measures said powell at his press conference last week referring to the cuts and we do believe that monetary policy operates with a long and variable lags and that it will take some time before the full effects of those actions are seen in the economy so that s one reason to hold back and wait all of that could change if the president sparks a new trade war with europe by imposing auto tariffs next year or if the economy starts to wobble from other shocks including boeing s decision to shut down production of its 737 max planes while the us economy has been a bright spot around the world other countries have continued to struggle since the great recession a decade ago it s one of the reasons that inflation and wage growth have remained muted in the us things have changed radically over the last year said frick i can remember when gdp was under 2 and analysts said there s a recession around the corner now that our expectations and indeed reality has been taking down to a 2 growth level we re ok between 1 5 and 2 we can go on for years at that rate that may not be enough for trump trump has threatened to fire powell on multiple occasions for not doing enough to juice the economy a radical break with precedent walling off the central bank from political pressure and while powell a sober former investment banker has repeatedly insisted he was relying on data and not politics to make his decisions the global economic turbulence stemming from trump s own trade wars prompted him to reverse his plans to raise rates this year and instead steadily drive them back down even the president s closest advisers acknowledge that appears to be over stephen moore a conservative economic commentator who trump considered for a fed slot earlier this year met with the president earlier this week at the white house to discuss the us economy and says trump is still unhappy with the fed and hankering for more cuts that he s unlikely to get trump wants at least a couple more rate cuts from the fed and he s not going to get it that s for sure said moore a former cnn contributor david wessel director of the hutchins center on fiscal and monetary policy at the brookings institution said trump s public criticism may have made members of the central bank s federal open market committee hesitate more than they would have before cutting rates this year to counter economic pressures from the president s turbulent trade war with china it made it harder and perhaps some people on the fomc were reluctant to cut rates because among other things they didn t want to appear to be succumbing to the president s pressure said wessel but bottom line other than making things uncomfortable i m not sure it made a hell of a difference and a bit of the irony is the president got what he wanted but he seems unable to declare victory

virtually everything is winning in this remarkable year and the world s major asset classes are collectively on course for the strongest annual performance since 2009 even in a go slow week the s p 500 posted four record closes we call it a grand cru which in wine terms means a very good vintage said dirk thiels the brussels based head of investment management at kbc asset management nv the scorecard tells the story america s equity benchmark has climbed 28 per cent a global stocks gauge is up 23 per cent a worldwide credit index rose 10 per cent emerging market sovereign dollar bonds added 12 per cent even treasuries and gold those classic safe havens advanced about 7 per cent and 15 per cent respectively staying on the sidelines was about the only way to lose the greenback has gone nowhere in 12 months yet even as they celebrate traders mapping out their 2020 strategies know the scoreboard only tells half of the story this brilliant year has brutal roots and it s blurring the outlook for anyone making a call on what lies ahead a lot of what we ve seen at the beginning of the year was actually taking back some of the correction in the last part of last year thiels said the fourth quarter of 2018 was the setback that allowed the comeback put aside the tendency to think in calendar years and consider some of the returns since the end of last september the s p 500 is up about 10 per cent global stocks climbed less than 7 per cent adding those extra three months to the calculation means 50 per cent bigger gains for treasuries and gold the trick of the light is that the market reversal came with a pivot by major central banks toward easier policy which coincided with the calendar in december 2018 the federal reserve was still raising interest rates by january the hiking cycle had ended equities became relatively attractive again while interest rates went down said simon wiersma investment manager at ing bank nv s wealth management unit we have to be honest it was a far better year than we expected the dazzling gains are almost blinding for wall street s prognosticators for instance with the s p 500 already well above many year end expectations professional forecasters are giving the least optimistic annual outlook in more than a decade our core argument at this point will be that there s a lot of good news priced in said david holohan head of equity strategy at mediolanum it leads to what is probably a sideways move from here just by virtue of how much more expensive equities have gotten bond yields will be a similar story he said unless a big shift in macro data prompts any move by the fed elsewhere the strong performance of investment grade credit and emerging market bonds is broadly similar whether you include the 2018 turmoil or not which underscores the stocks led nature of that rout adjusting for the volatility of each asset in 2019 gauges of corporate and developing nation debt are also among the best returning thank demand for duration amid stubbornly low inflation enduring albeit slow economic growth and an era of negative rates that makes it easier for borrowers to service their debts while sending investors in search of assets with a reasonable yield even allowing for those types of structural market shifts and the rebound which the 2018 fourth quarter tumult made possible the performance across assets this year surpassed many expectations
20 12 2019 opinion why the us china trade war could re escalate anne o krueger washington dc the phase one trade deal between the united states and china addresses only some of the us government s concerns and its remaining demands will be much harder to resolve but while both america and china have an interest in the success of the open multilateral global trading system current us policy is undermining that goal after nearly 18 months of tit for tat tariff increases the united states and china have reached a phase one agreement to start de escalating their trade war as part of the deal us president donald trump canceled further tariff increases on chinese goods that had been scheduled to take effect on december 15 and halved a 15 tariff on 120 billion worth of imports from china as for china it shelved its planned retaliatory measures and committed to import some 50 billion worth of us agricultural products in each of the next two years but the promised de escalation should not be overestimated for starters it is not clear how china could follow through on its import commitment without violating the world trade organization principle of non discrimination among trading partners moreover the 25 us tariff on 250 billion of chinese imports remains in place with further reductions linked to progress in future trade negotiations in fact the current agreement addresses only some of the us government s trade related complaints against china and its remaining demands will be much more challenging to resolve broadly speaking the us wants the chinese authorities to take steps to eliminate their country s bilateral trade surplus with the us end currency manipulation cease intellectual property ip theft refrain from further forced technology transfer halt subsidies to state owned enterprises soes and stop acquisitions of us companies through state sponsored investment if this were a negotiation one might sensibly ask what the chinese authorities were seeking from the us in exchange for its steps in these areas but this is not a negotiation the trump administration is presenting china with a set of demands which if unmet will result in punishment there are three major problems with the american demands first some of them are conceptually erroneous second in a global trading system bilateral action often results only in a rearrangement of trading partners third it is not clear what the chinese government could do to satisfy some of the us demands for starters the demand that china eliminate its bilateral trade surplus with the us is misguided there is no reason why merchandise trade balances should matter at all for one thing services trade is equally important exporting financial services is almost certainly more economically rewarding than exporting coal for example moreover some countries offer many more worthwhile investment opportunities than others citizens in countries with less attractive opportunities benefit from buying assets where the return is higher and these investments are financed by current account imbalances even then bilateral balances are irrelevant the current account balance is the difference between domestic investment and domestic saving in the private and public sectors and the us deficit is global if one country reduces its surplus with america the us economy will simply adjust both imports and exports the us demand regarding currency manipulation reflects a similar fallacy the apparent intent is to reduce america s bilateral trade deficit with china but until the us savings investment balance changes that will not happen us law stipulates three criteria for identifying currency manipulation by a trading partner a global current account surplus of more than 3 of gdp persistent intervention to buy foreign exchange and sell domestic currency and a bilateral trade surplus with the us of more than 20 billion because china currently meets only the third condition it is not a currency manipulator under us law that did not stop the trump administration from labeling the country one in august the other us objectives regarding ip theft technology transfer subsidies to soes and investment requirements can satisfactorily be addressed only at the multilateral level like any wto member the us can bring a complaint when it believes that a trading partner has not abided by wto rules which admittedly could be strengthened but the trump administration has filed only two cases against china despite the fact that the us had previously won 91 of the cases it brought to the wto and even though the chinese authorities have a good track record of amending their practices when wto panels have ruled against them when wto rules do not cover a particular case members should seek to amend them moreover other major us trading partners notably canada the european union and japan have voiced many of the same trade concerns regarding china if the us joined forces with them they would have much greater bargaining power vis à vis china than america would have on its own but instead of using the wto the trump administration incredibly is undermining it by blocking the appointment of new judges to the organization s dispute settlement body the dsb should have seven appointed members of whom three must be on any panel hearing a case but because the us has consistently vetoed candidates to replace judges who have completed their terms the dsb now has only one member and thus can no longer function although the dsb certainly could be rendered more effective it has been very useful in settling disputes and preventing trade wars dismantling the entire process makes no sense finally even regarding valid us concerns there is no indication regarding what changes the chinese government should make to satisfy the trump administration it is in both america s and china s interest that the open multilateral global trading system prosper and support economic growth worldwide unfortunately there is little prospect that current american policy can achieve that goal anne o krueger a former world bank chief economist and former first deputy managing

for the past year president donald trump has repeatedly ping ponged between claiming the economy is booming and blasting the federal reserve for not doing enough to support economic growth would be sooo great if the fed would further lower interest rates and quantitative ease trump tweeted on tuesday less than a week after the us central bank signaled it would be hitting the pause button on any more rate cuts going forward the dollar is very strong against other currencies and there is almost no inflation this is the time to do it exports would zoom the president campaigned on promises of 3 growth and is presiding over somewhat less than that with a final report issued friday showing respectable 2 1 growth for the third quarter but the economy is getting rave reviews with 76 of respondents in a new cnn poll conducted by ssrs rating economic conditions in the us today as very or somewhat good significantly more than those who said so at this time last year 67 this is the highest share to say the economy is good since february 2001 when 80 said so that s in part thanks to the fed s success in keeping the us economy running smoothly over the last year with unemployment hovering near 50 year record lows and the stock market hitting record highs nevertheless there are worrying signs business investment has fallen the last two quarters the first decline in three years according to the bureau of economic analysis manufacturing layoffs have ticked up since the summer and on friday us steel announced plans to close a mill near detroit and cut 1 500 workers in response the commander in chief has pushed unusual economic ideas including publicly pressuring the fed to cut rates to zero and even at times suggesting rates should fall into negative territory the fed however has shown no signs of taking trump s suggestions at the fed s final meeting of the year powell and his colleagues signaled they would be sitting on the sidelines for some time powell said the three rates cuts this year were key decisions that helped to support the economy which was showing signs of potentially tipping into recession over the summer the fed is basically saying things are cool we don t really want to change things we re going to sit this one out for the foreseeable future said robert frick corporate economist with navy federal credit union that means they ve done their job powell has himself argued it would take a lot for the fed to move in either direction next year we took strong measures said powell at his press conference last week referring to the cuts and we do believe that monetary policy operates with a long and variable lags and that it will take some time before the full effects of those actions are seen in the economy so that s one reason to hold back and wait all of that could change if the president sparks a new trade war with europe by imposing auto tariffs next year or if the economy starts to wobble from other shocks including boeing s decision to shut down production of its 737 max planes while the us economy has been a bright spot around the world other countries have continued to struggle since the great recession a decade ago it s one of the reasons that inflation and wage growth have remained muted in the us things have changed radically over the last year said frick i can remember when gdp was under 2 and analysts said there s a recession around the corner now that our expectations and indeed reality has been taking down to a 2 growth level we re ok between 1 5 and 2 we can go on for years at that rate that may not be enough for trump trump has threatened to fire powell on multiple occasions for not doing enough to juice the economy a radical break with precedent walling off the central bank from political pressure and while powell a sober former investment banker has repeatedly insisted he was relying on data and not politics to make his decisions the global economic turbulence stemming from trump s own trade wars prompted him to reverse his plans to raise rates this year and instead steadily drive them back down even the president s closest advisers acknowledge that appears to be over stephen moore a conservative economic commentator who trump considered for a fed slot earlier this year met with the president earlier this week at the white house to discuss the us economy and says trump is still unhappy with the fed and hankering for more cuts that he s unlikely to get trump wants at least a couple more rate cuts from the fed and he s not going to get it that s for sure said moore a former cnn contributor david wessel director of the hutchins center on fiscal and monetary policy at the brookings institution said trump s public criticism may have made members of the central bank s federal open market committee hesitate more than they would have before cutting rates this year to counter economic pressures from the president s turbulent trade war with china it made it harder and perhaps some people on the fomc were reluctant to cut rates because among other things they didn t want to appear to be succumbing to the president s pressure said wessel but bottom line other than making things uncomfortable i m not sure it made a hell of a difference and a bit of the irony is the president got what he wanted but he seems unable to declare victory

dear reader former chief economic adviser arvind subramanian says he is puzzled why the indian stock market is so buoyant when the economy is in such dire straits in a recent paper he said the indian

although quite a bit of it seems to be flowing in other streets in the country instead all that arvind subramanian has to do is look at the msci indices which show india has not been doing as well as the msci emerging market asia index and of course there is the well known fact that the rally is driven by a few frontline stocks the midcap indices are nowhere near their highs as for the reasons why equities are rallying across the globe it would have been a worry if they did not what with united states president donald trump and us fed chair jerome powell playing santa to be sure the so called phase 1 deal is still shrouded in secrecy and may well prove to be a fudge aimed at the us elections we were accordingly suitably cautious about the deal and warned that a lot of ground needed to be

cnn happy friday a version of this story first appeared in cnn business before the bell newsletter not a subscriber you can sign up right here 2019 was the year that brought us wework s disastrous ipo effort which ended not with a blockbuster debut but with a hefty bailout from softbank its top investor the rescue valued wework at 8 billion a stunning fall from its peak at 47 billion the wework saga was a kind of reckoning for tech valuations in private markets but that doesn t mean venture capitalists are shying away from big deals according to a recent outlook from analysts at pitchbook the research firm thinks mega deal activity will reach a new record in 2020 when startups are expected to notch more vc backed investments of over 100 million than ever before this year saw an all

finance professor at the university of florida who specializes in valuations and ipos told me the wework effect the big takeaway from wework s botched ipo in his view is that a focus on growth at all costs has given way to a greater emphasis on how startups can starting making money the humbling of softbank which paired its huge financial clout with a focus on rapid expansion certainly helps in his view but venture capital firms still have a lot of money to plow into major deals pitchbook notes that returns and cash flow to vc investors have been especially positive in the past two years amid a healthy environment for ipos and buyouts and more nontraditional investors say asset manager t rowe price or the qatar investment authority have been more likely to get in on the venture

raising the potential specter of commodity inflation could the federal reserve have to gulp raise rates in 2020 after all i m worried about complacency in the near term some froth has been building here said liz ann sonders chief investment strategist with charles schwab inflation could be one of those things that picks up especially since so many people think inflation is dead and buried of course rate hikes in an election year are unlikely president trump s bashing of fed chief jerome powell on twitter would probably escalate to alarmingly new levels but they re not completely out of the question the fed after all reacts to data and tries to be as apolitical as possible if inflation pressures mount the fed may be forced to act just as it did in 1992 in the midst of a presidential race after he lost to bill clinton president george h w bush famously blamed former fed chair alan greenspan for keeping rates too high inflation returns with a vengeance that s why some strategists see inflation creeping up as a possible 2020 problem for the markets and economy crude prices have held above the 60 level if oil continues to go higher over the next six months are we going to be talking about inflation said td ameritrade chief market strategist jj kinahan we haven t talked about inflation for so long and it s the punch you don t see that usually knocks you out kinahan added kinahan notes that in addition to higher commodity prices wages are steadily increasing and the dollar has weakened following a strong start to the year add all that up and inflation pressures may start to eat into corporate profits that could be bad news for stocks given that valuations are starting to look a bit rich if the fed reacts to inflation and starts raising rates then i would get nervous said john schlifske chairman president and ceo of northwestern mutual there s always the potential for a curve ball central banks around the world in general are a risk earnings estimates may need to come down inflation isn t the only possible bugaboo that could derail the stock market and the economy sonders said she s keeping a close eye on potential cracks in the job market sure employers are still adding a healthy number of workers and the unemployment remains near a half century low but she noted that there have been troubling kinks in the most recent weekly jobless claims numbers with more people filing for unemployment benefits in states with big agricultural and industrial industries i e those with more exposure to tariffs and the trade war with china profit forecasts for 2020 might be too high sonders said and she s concerned that businesses will need to absorb the hit from higher tariffs instead of passing them on to consumers manufacturers have been talking about how sourcing in china is an issue and companies are limited with what they can do to shift their supply chains they are doing the best they can but they are eating a lot of the higher costs sonders said don t ignore the 2020 election and brexit political uncertainty remains as well at home and abroad the market could have a stronger reaction to political rhetoric once we get past the conventions and have a clear democratic candidate said john conlon chief equity strategist with people s united advisors while investors often try to ignore the noise there is a chance that two sectors that have performed well this year technology and health care could get hit conlon said president trump has talked about reining in drug prices and he has made no secret of his animosity towards amazon facebook google owner alphabet and other tech giants and the more progressive democratic contenders most notably elizabeth warren and bernie sanders also have bold plans for the health care and tech industries on the international front american investors may need to pay more attention to the chaotic brexit situation and the potential that market turmoil could spill over to the european continent if that happens the economies of big european nations like germany could slow that in turn could further weaken growth in china given how much that nation relies on europe as an end market rich sega global chief investment strategist for conning worries that europe could be a drag on global growth that s not going to get better with brexit and how that will impact exports to china he told cnn business in other words the market still has a lot to worry about but you wouldn t know it by looking at how well the dow s p 500 and nasdaq have done this year
abhishek goenka global macroeconomic themes track in 2020 story continues below advertisement remove ad as 2019 draws to an end we are seeing some positive traction on two key risk themes that have kept the global markets on tenterhooks over the last couple of years us china trade tensions and brexit the us china phase one trade deal has finally seen the light of the day in the uk conservatives have emerged victorious in the general elections and with a majority in the parliament it would be easier for prime minister boris johnson to deliver on his core campaign promise i e to get brexit done unfortunately given how complex both the underlying issues are the way forward is likely to be convoluted and we expect developments on these themes to certainly drive the global risk sentiment in 2020 also below are the key themes to track in 2020 and our expectations under various scenarios story continues below advertisement remove ad 2020 us presidential elections a test of trumponomics the central plot for 2020 where we expect a lot of drama to unfold is the us presidential elections the democrats charges for impeachment in the house of representatives on december 18 was passed although the president is impeached he may not be removed from office as that would require a two thirds majority in the senate which at the moment is controlled by the republicans if the democrats succeed in getting the allegations against the president to resonate with the voters it would further lower trump s approval ratings president trump on the other hand would want to showcase the health of the us economy pointing to unemployment rate which is at a multi decade low and stock indices which are at record highs as a testimony to his economic policies generally no incumbent president has lost a re election bid with the economy doing well also no president has won a re election bid with an approval rating below 50 percent in trump s case both these statistics cannot hold at the same time and it will be interesting to see which one gives way story continues below advertisement remove ad any development that tilts the scales in favour of president trump would be dollar positive and risk positive and vice versa the top three democrat contenders in order of their current chances are joe biden bernie sanders and elizabeth warren markets would keenly follow who emerges on top to challenge trump in the race to become the next us president if warren turns out to be the one then one can expect a massive sell off in us equities bonds and the us dollar on account of her left leaning ideology which is not seen as being business and market friendly us china trade tensions patches of agreement swathes of disagreement phase one of the us china trade deal is more like the tip of the iceberg what we have got now seems like a temporary truce both sides were desperate to show some progress and closure to their constituents while the deal may benefit a section of trump s voter base and help him lift his approval ratings more contentious issues continue to remain unresolved even the commitment on the part of china to purchase 40 50 billion of us farm goods seems too ambitious given that prior to the start of the trade war china had bought 24 billion of us farm goods in 2017 and the most it has ever bought so far was worth 29 billion in 2013 president trump has said phase two negotiations would commence immediately but he has not specified any timeline on the same phase 2 negotiations are expected to cover issues such as the chinese government subsidies to state owned enterprises digital trade data localization cross border data flows and cyber intrusions the extent of hardball president trump plays in phase two would depend on the state of the economy and markets heading into the elections his approval ratings and on who the democrat challenger is just like in 2019 we expect a lot of comments and statements coming in from both sides we expect some patches of an agreement but large swathes of disagreement brexit a tumultuous transition period lies ahead with a majority the conservatives will be able to push through the withdrawal agreement bill agreed by boris johnson with the eu through the uk parliament legally taking the uk out of the eu thereafter there shall be a short window of 11 months until december 31 2020 by when the uk and eu would have to hammer out a trade deal that would establish the future of their trading relationship this could be a tall order especially if the uk wants to differ significantly from current eu standards and tariffs the more closely aligned the uk is with european standards the smoother the transition would be given the health of the uk economy there is a possibility the bank of england could cut rates in q2 after considering the progress made on future trading relations during the transition period we expect the pound to trade 1 2750 1 40 during 2020 with a risk of breaking lower if downside risks to the uk economy emerge from a tumultuous transition period health of the chinese economy a dragon on its knees the global engine of growth has been slowing deleveraging has taken its toll on the chinese economy china s auto sales have contracted in 17 out of the past 18 months the third quarter gdp growth was at 6 percent its lowest in nearly three decades growth in q4 is expected to slow down further while the government has taken small steps to boost infrastructure growth no large scale stimulus measures have been announced so far the response from the people s bank of china has also been measured it has cut the loan prime rate by merely 5bps to 4 15 percent from 4 20 percent this indicates that china wants to tread cautiously striking a balance between debt and growth considering that china has accounted for one third of global growth in recent years lack of immediate revival in chinese demand could keep global growth suppressed eurusd and usdjpy 3m atm vols the question on everybody s mind is whether we will see the low volatility environment of 2019 continue into 2020 the volatility in eur usd and usd jpy is at or close to its historic lows this does not come as a surprise given that there is little policy divergence between the major global central banks the fed the ecb and the boj all three are accommodative and stand ready to ease more if their respective economies worsen all three are currently engaged in some kind of asset purchases though the fed is doing more so to manage liquidity for volatility to return we need policy divergence to reappear therefore it would be very important to track the incoming data especially from the us and eurozone the fed is better placed than the ecb and the boj as the us economy is relatively stronger the median dot plot indicates that the next action of the fed could be a hike though far ahead in 2021 the fed is expected to pause and watch the effects of its midcycle policy adjustment play out we expect the fed to remain on hold through 2020 however the pillar holding the us economy so far is consumption and if that falters we could be looking at an even more dovish fed and that could be negative for the us dollar we see eur usd trading in 1 07 1 16 and usd jpy in 104 50 112 50 during 2020 on the geopolitical front anti government protests in hong kong france south america and iran

world bank research has pointed to a global wave of debt since 2010 that has led to developing countries accumulating a towering 55 trillion of debt the largest in history the analysis is contained in a book length report global waves of debt causes and consequences issued earlier this week in his foreword to the publication world bank president david malpass noted that waves of debt accumulation have been a major feature of the global economy over the past 50 years with four in emerging and developing economies since 1970 the first three waves ended in financial crises the latin american debt crisis of the 1980s the asian financial crisis of the late 1990s and the global financial crisis of 2007 2009 he wrote a fourth wave began in 2010 and reached 55 trillion in developing countries at the end of last year making it the largest broadest and fastest growing of the four while debt financing can help meet urgent needs such as basic infrastructure much of the current debt wave is taking riskier forms the report pointed out that the present escalation was taking place in conditions of lower growth than prevailed in the period prior to the crisis of 2007 2009 while emerging and developing economies were growing at a slower rate than in the past their debt levels were rising more rapidly since 2010 debt in developing economies has risen to a total of around 170 percent of their gross domestic product an increase of 54 percentage points in just eight years the report noted that while developing economies had experienced periods of volatility in the current debt wave they had not suffered a widespread financial crisis however it continued the exceptional size speed and reach of debt accumulation wer cause for concern despite the sharp rise in debt these economies have experienced a decade of repeated growth disappointments and are now facing weaker growth prospects in a fragile global economy in addition to the rapid debt build up they have accumulated other vulnerabilities such as growing fiscal and current account deficits and a shift towards a riskier composition of debt previous waves were largely regional in nature but the fourth wave has been widespread with total debt rising in 80 percent of emerging market and developing economies increasing by at least 20 percentage points of gdp in just over a third of these economies the report warned that on a number of measures developing economies were in a worse position than before the global financial crisis three quarters had budget deficits corporate debt denominated in foreign currencies was much higher and current account deficits were four times larger than in 2007 this meant that despite exceptionally low interest rates and the prospect of continued low rates in the near term the current wave of debt accumulation could follow the historical pattern and culminate in financial crises the largest increase in debt is in china where the debt to gdp ratio has risen by 72 points to 255 percent since 2010 this is the result of measures initiated by the government and financial authorities to sustain economic growth in the wake of the global financial crisis and recession the chinese government is now trying to rein in debt accumulation at the same time it is seeking to maintain economic growth under conditions where the increase in gdp is at its lowest level in 30 years earlier this week bloomberg reported on an interview given by ma jun an external adviser to the people s bank of china in which he called for measures to prevent systemic risks resulting from the failure of local government borrowing platforms he warned of a chain reaction if defaults damaged market confidence and said local government borrowing vehicles should be allowed to take over their weaker counterparts including those in other provinces local government borrowing particularly to finance infrastructure programs plays a vital role in maintaining the growth of the chinese economy the rise of corporate debt in china is also of increasing concern in the last eight years corporate debt as a percentage of gdp has increased by more than 60 points a reuters report noted that increased debt is generating smaller increases in production than in the past this is reflected in a three fold increase in the incremental capital output ratio from 2009 top 2017 in other words the report said china s credit heavy financing spree was not matched by a corresponding boost in productivity but by an increasingly inefficient use of credit which suggests china s corporations may have a deteriorating capacity to repay their existing debts it cited a finding by the international monetary fund in which it estimated that 15 5 percent of all commercial bank loans to the chinese corporate sector were at risk meaning that the firm s earnings were not sufficient to cover the interest payments on its loans the growing problems in the chinese corporate sector have been highlighted by a series of defaults and near defaults in shandong province over the past three months six privately owned companies have either defaulted or come close to defaulting on debts totalling 9 7 billion shandong is china s third richest province but in the past year its economy has markedly slowed industrial profits in october were down 15 5 percent compared to the previous year and its growth rate dropped to 5 4 percent in the first nine months of this year one of the lowest levels in the country the financial problems of individual corporations in the province are compounded by the arrangements between them in which one company comes to the aid of another if it runs into difficulties while this system provides for stability under conditions of overall expansion it risks spreading instability if the economy turns down commenting on the shandong defaults the financial times said the distress had become harbinger for financial risk across the country it cited a report by fitch ratings that due to a wave of defaults on corporate bonds the chinese private sector default rate had risen to a record 4 9 percent at the end of november compared to 0 6 percent in 2014

by gary north in 1959 henry hazlitt s book the failure of the new economics was published by d van nostrand company a reputable but midsized publishing company the book was subtitled an analysis of the keynesian fallacies this was hazlitt s magnum opus that is to say it was his great work yet it was narrowly focused it was a monograph in clear prose he took apart john maynard keynes s magnum opus the general theory of employment interest and money 1936 the book that indirectly reshaped economic theory in the second half of the twentieth century the book almost nobody has read almost no one has ever read the book there is good reason for this keynes book is unreadable its arguments are incoherent this is why we rarely see direct quotes from the book keynesianism did not become a major factor in the thinking of most economists until 1945 the keynesian movement accelerated in 1948 because of the first edition of paul samuelson s textbook economics i own a reprint of that original edition keynes is not quoted in the book samuelson mentioned him on pages 253 and 303 the book and its later editions have sold something in the range of four million copies it was the most successful economics textbook of the twentieth century it shaped the thinking or rather the non thinking of millions of students for seventy years yet almost none of these students has ever read the general theory cover to cover samuelson in 1946 wrote a laudatory assessment of the impact of the general theory it was published in econometrica an academic journal not noted for its clarity in any case it bears repeating that the general theory is an obscure book so that would be anti keynesians must assume their position largely on credit unless they are willing to put in a great deal of work and run the risk of seduction in the process the general theory seems the random notes over a period of years of a gifted man who in his youth gained the whip hand over his publishers by virtue of the acclaim and fortune resulting from the success of his economic consequences of the peace a reprint of his article is here the general theory was not well received at the time of this publication richard ebeling a misesian economist wrote in 2004 except for some of keynes s young protégés at cambridge university most of the reviewers of the book were highly critical of many of its theoretical innovations as well as its inflationary prescriptions for unemployment even some economists who later became proponents of keynes s new economics were initially highly critical of his work for example alvin hansen who was one of the leading advocates of keynesian economics in the united states in the 1950 s and 1960 s wrote in late 1936 that the general theory is not a landmark in the sense that it lays the foundation for a new economics the book is more a symptom of economic trends than a foundation stone upon which a science can be built yet within a few years and most certainly by the end of world war ii keynes s ideas had virtually pushed aside every other explanation of the causes and cures of economic depressions keynes s book became the foundation stone for the new macroeconomics in contrast to keynes s book hazlitt s book is readable although not so readable as all of his other books that is because he had to spend his time trying to make sense out of keynes s convoluted prose and shifting definitions but the book is coherent and his explanations are lucid as long as he was not directly citing keynes i read the book in the summer of 1963 i know this because i used to write the date on which i had bought a book on the front inside cover page i did not read economics in one lesson until 1971 when i became a senior staff member at the foundation for economic education fee the first book spoiled me it really is a tour de force i realize that the second book was his bestseller and is a fine introductory book for people who know nothing about economic theory but his book on keynes outshines it unfortunately almost nobody has read it it remains an unread book that demolishes an equally unread book in 1960 van nostrand published a follow up volume edited by hazlitt the critics of keynesian economics it is a compilation of scholarly articles written by critics of keynes the mises institute has done yeoman service in making certain that both of these books remain in print and both of them remain available in pdf format free of charge the memory hole hazlitt s book was not the first full length book to criticize keynes or the longest that honor belongs to arthur marget who was the first economist to devote a book to critiquing a narrow aspect of keynes s general theory it is a two volume behemoth of over fourteen hundred pages the theory of prices it also covered keynes s earlier book treatise on money 1930 the first volume was published in 1938 the second volume was published in 1942 it was unknown when it was published and it remained unknown after it was republished in 1966 it is not as incoherent as keynes s book but it is turgid prolic and unread almost no economist has ever heard of marget that was true in his day too there is no wikipedia entry on him his book did not go down the memory hole it was published at the bottom of the memory hole and it remained there john egger wrote a detailed review of it in 1995 which gives you some indication of just how obscure it is it took over half a century to get a detailed review egger concluded labels aside marget s work offers scholarship in the history of monetary doctrine that is unmatched and an analysis of processes that is in some respects unmatched in explicitly austrian works prolixity or not it deserves to be recognized as an exciting and significant contribution to the tradition of the methodologically individualistic analysis of monetary processes the use of the adjective exciting to describe this book i regard as exaggerated the mises institute has made a pdf available of each volume hazlitt in 1959 was a well known economist he had a regular column in newsweek from 1946 to 1966 the mises institute has reprinted those articles in a massive 800 page book business tides yet despite his name identification the economic guild successfully blacked out references to hazlitt s book on keynes i never recall seeing a footnote to the book in any academic economic article other than those published in austrian school journals the economists academic guild never took hazlitt seriously after all hazlitt did not go to college keynes did go to college but he did not major in economics he majored in mathematics that certainly did not in any way hamper his capture of the academic guild after 1945 we have waited for seven decades for some other economist with hazlitt s ability to penetrate an opponent s arguments analyze them critically and report on why they 1 are incoherent and 2 fail to deal with economic reality w h hutt did attempt to do this in a 1963 book keynesianism retrospect and prospect and a follow up book the keynesian episode a reassessment 1980 but hutt s books were turgid and uninspiring i say this as a fan of hutt i had intended to study economics under him he got me a graduate fellowship when our joint plans fell through in 1967 in refuting keynes he allowed keynes s convoluted arguments to overwhelm his own prose these two books never gained traction even within the free market anti keynes community they never gained traction in a 1971 article hutt commented on this i had expected reasoned objections to my rigorously stated argument following the publication of my book none has been forthcoming nor has a subsequent article of mine entitled keynesian revisions which submitted further evidence of a retreat by major exponents of the keynesian gospel called forth any reply in the meantime the retreat has continued although apart from leijonhufvud s impressive and scholarly critique i am aware of no further direct attack on the keynesian system leijonhufvud s 1968 book on keynesian economics and the economics of keynes a study in monetary theory is also impenetrable it was written for his academic peers but it had no effect in slowing down the keynesian juggernaut it was not a hard core assault on keynesian economics it did not get reprinted it has long since disappeared he noted in the book s introduction that the exegesis of the general theory had fallen into disfavor what he did not mention was that this exegeting had been required after 1945 because newly converted young economists felt it necessary to explain what keynes had really meant this was because nobody could figure out what he meant leijonhufvud wrote john maynard keynes the general theory of employment interest and money signaled a revolution in economic theory and the beginning of modem macro theory no other economic work in this century has been the subject of anything even approaching the vast outpouring of commentary and criticism that the general theory has received but in the last five or ten years theoretical and exegetical interest in the general theory has declined markedly the long keynes and the classics debate devoted to the appraisal of the precise nature and significance of keynes innovations has at last almost petered out the label post keynesian attached to much recent theoretical research is symptomatic of the widespread view that the book on the general theory is closed that the keynesian revolution is over and that what was worthwhile in it has been digested and the rest discarded the general theory has itself become a classic a work which the active theorist need not consult but in which historians of economic doctrines will have a continuing interest the general theory had become a classic in this sense from the day it was published nobody consulted it nobody quoted it as authoritative like the crowd that cheered the emperor with no clothes the academic world awaited a clear sighted child who would announce to the world the emperor has no clothes hazlitt made this announcement and proved it but the crowd continued to cheer the emperor it pushed hazlitt to the back of the crowd and pretended he had never issued his evaluation the two core errors hazlitt was always very gracious to me he was gracious to everybody he met therefore it may be remiss for me to make two observations but he won t mind he has been dead a long time hazlitt and all of the other critics of keynes never did get to the primary points with respect to what was wrong with keynes one point was theoretical the other was practical were i to write a book on keynes i would begin the introduction with my two observations then i would pursue these two observations for several hundred pages i would not invoke jargon i would not use any equations i would simply hammer over and over and over on these two points 1 theory the entire keynesian apparatus rests on this assumption the economy needs greater spending in order to pull it out of recession the system is therefore a demand side analysis he argued that investors fearing the loss of their money would invest if they invest this will lead to reduced consumption and a worse recession he ignored the obvious all of money invested goes to other people s incomes the money stays in the economy rewarding those with assets to sell whether labor capital or raw materials this money disappears argument was the same conceptual error made by major c h douglas in the years after world war i whom keynes praised in the general theory pp 370 71 this was the social credit movement s supreme error i have written a book on this the entire keynesian apparatus rests on this assumption the economy needs greater spending in order to pull it out of recession the system is therefore a demand side analysis he argued that investors fearing the loss of their money would invest if they invest this will lead to reduced consumption and a worse recession he ignored the obvious the money stays in the economy rewarding those with assets to sell whether labor capital or raw materials this money disappears argument was the same conceptual error made by major c h douglas in the years after world war i whom keynes praised in the general theory pp 370 71 this was the social credit movement s supreme error i have written a book on this salvation through inflation the question then is this where will the government get its hands on the money that it will use to spend there are only three ways borrow it print it or tax it out of the hands of the public where had the money been before the government borrowed or taxed it had been in people s bank accounts the banks were lending out money and borrowers deposited it in their accounts if the government had not intervened with massive deficits selling its ious to the banks or to the investors directly the banks would have had to invest the money somewhere money is not stored under mattresses so the government simply extracted the money from investors who would have had to seek out profitable avenues of lending bearing the uncertainty of their actions the money would have been spent one way or another it would have been spent either in forming capital or else providing consumer loans in other words the government cannot get something from nothing this critique should be front and center the entire critique should rest on this obvious fact there is no such thing as a free lunch there is also no such thing as a free investment the heart of john maynard keynes analysis in 1936 was the idea of a permanent free market equilibrium with high unemployment for some reason which he never explained coherently sellers refuse to lower their prices when faced with buyers who refuse to buy at yesterday s pre depression prices this is especially true of workers who refuse to cut their wage demands keynesianism is based on two fundamental ideas 1 sellers do not learn that something is better than nothing and therefore will not lower their selling prices 2 economists do not learn that government spending that is financed by debt is accomplished in one of only two ways a money lent by savers which could have been lent to businesses or consumers b money lent by a central bank which lowers the purchasing power of the currency unit this is a philosophy of something for nothing 2 practice keynesianism has always wrapped itself in equations and mathematics but here is reality government spending is determined not by mathematics but by the ability of politicians to extract wealth from the general public and still get reelected there is nothing scientific about it the entire keynesian analytical apparatus which itself is self contradictory has never been used by politicians in a scientific way to determine what degree of taxation borrowing or inflating will suffice in pulling an economy out of recession or depression there is no science of keynesian economics that tells politicians how much taxation or debt or how much borrowing of newly created money from the central bank is appropriate politicians pay no attention to the recommendations of keynesian economists which shows wisdom on the part of politicians politicians are far wiser in this regard than economists who have been granted a phd degree by other economists conclusion some bright young economist would be wise to establish his reputation as the premier anti keynesian economist of this generation i proposed this a decade ago but no one has taken the bait the place to start reading for a career long project along these lines is the failure of the new economics then go to hunter lewis where keynes went wrong 2009 then go here
japan s tax revenue is expected to end up lower than the record high figure estimated in the fiscal 2020 draft budget with critics saying the initial tally was based on an economic growth forecast that was too optimistic since prime minister shinzo abe returned to power in late 2012 the actual pace of growth in the world s third largest economy has exceeded his government s forecast only twice in the extra budget for fiscal 2019 the finance ministry revised down its tax revenue estimate for the year through march to 60 18 trillion 550 billion from 62 50 trillion due to a drop in corporate earnings amid a slowdown of the global economy
b c liberal leader has party renewal plans for 2020 black press legislature reporter tom fletcher sat down with b c liberal leader andrew wilkinson for a year end interview to discuss the b c government s 2019 record and his expectations for the coming year an edited transcript follows tf you ve been focused on the troubles of the forest industry and i ll start with the b c interior what practically can a provincial government do in this situation aw talking to forest workers in quesnel and williams lake and prince george they are pretty frustrated that this government is paying no attention whatsoever to their concerns with thousands of people facing christmas with no income the obvious question that comes from forest workers throughout b c is why do we have the highest log costs in north america the stumpage rates are set in a one year delay whereas in alberta they re set every month so the story comes back that the forest workers are busy in alberta and they re facing an idle and impoverished christmas here in b c we re seeing massive slowdowns at least 90 curtailments and permanent shutdowns across the province this year a six month long strike at western forest products on vancouver island and the provincial government has done nothing people are wondering what s going to happen to their livelihood because their houses are declining in value and they ve got bank loans tf we ve had constant warnings from the ndp government about provoking the americans by lowering stumpage is that still valid aw it s a concern when our government said they don t want to provoke the americans by adjusting stumpage but they ve already adjusted it in alberta with no adverse effects so what s going on with our forests minister he s reluctant to meet with forest communities because he knows he ll get told off unemployed people don t want to hear excuses they want answers tf the employer health tax is in effect with payments due on march 31 2020 and medical services plan payments are ending jan 1 premier john horgan says calls this one of the biggest tax cuts in b c history aw he seems to have forgotten about the 25 per cent income tax cut that gordon campbell brought in in 2001 tf and revenues did recover aw yes because the economy recovered after a decade of the ndp s catastrophic economic policy tf at this stage nobody s defending the collection of msp are they aw there s no prospect of msp premiums coming back the problem we ve got now is that the ndp has now piled on 19 new or increased taxes most of which hit small business and small business is by far the biggest economic driver in b c with 98 per cent of employment combined with property taxes they re driving people out of retail they re driving employment outside b c because of the heavy taxation here a lot of manufacturers are saying they re going to move out of b c tf they did reduce the small business income tax but the large corporate tax went up meanwhile the u s cut corporate taxes substantially we hear the premier talking about big forest companies reducing operations here and buying mills in the southern u s part of that is timber supply and market but there has to be an effect as businesses ask how much tax they have to pay to function and employ people outlook 2020 john horgan on forests union labour and icbc related strata rental bans escape speculation tax until 2021 related b c carbon tax increased now raises nearly 2 billion aw it s pretty obvious that john horgan doesn t get it we have the highest log costs in north america new taxes and a 40 drop in corporate income taxes in the u s so businesses look at leaving b c particularly in the forest industry tf so is that going in your 2021 platform reduce corporate taxes aw we re going to be pushing the ndp hard to figure out what they re going to do if anything in the forest industry and to try to make b c genuinely more affordable they ran on the promise of affordability there s no improvement in the cost of housing they ve driven up costs for just about everybody with icbc premiums and they ve made it very tough for people under 35 who are probably the first generation of british columbians who are going to see a decline in their standard of living tf in urban areas we re starting to see a decline in housing prices was the empty homes tax not the right thing to do aw b c has a major problem in that about 60 000 people arrive here every year that s been true since the 1960s the population grows predictably but the supply of housing is not growing whether you re in fernie or revelstoke or kelowna or metro vancouver or parts of victoria there s a major shortage of housing particularly rental housing the ndp s approach is to destroy the value of housing to try and drive down the cost that doesn t do anything about supply we need to build more housing in b c households are smaller more people are arriving and there s nowhere for them to live tf when the b c liberals were in government you talked about the difficulty of getting municipal zoning and paying development charges and all of that is anything being done and what would you propose there aw we ve seen no movement at all from john horgan and the ndp on making it easier to get things done in municipalities the existing rules which are written by the provincial government are way too onerous so you get this extended permit process and things take years before you can get anything done on the ground we need to streamline that tf one of the taxes that s going up is carbon tax and there is no more corresponding reduction in personal or business income tax and now we have what s being advertised on tv as cleanbc parts of that are ok aren t they aw the carbon tax when it came in was supposed to be revenue neutral now we find it s just become a tax grab the ndp say don t worry we use the money we grab from you at the gas pump and your heating bill and we ll use it for cleanbc but it turns out only a small proportion of the money is going to this cleanbc thing we have no idea what difference it s going to make to daily life and so we have to wonder if they re really serious about this or if it s just greenwashing the ndp agenda tf they talk about energy efficient buildings and that includes phasing out natural gas for home heating it s ok to sell it to korea and china but not to use it here is that realistic aw b c has a major asset in high quality gas fields in the peace river country we have a very efficient existing pipeline system that works flawlessly and we have millions of clean burning furnaces and barbecues all over b c that people rely upon and enjoy if someone s going to tell them that individual homeowners have to spend thousands of dollars to convert their heating systems there had better be a good answer about who s going to pay for that tf the plan is to subsidize the purchase of electric heat pumps to replace natural gas furnaces aw this reminds me of a federal program in 2004 when my family spent 9 000 on a high efficiency furnace and got 1 500 back you ve got to have a lot of money sitting in your pocket to invest in these fancy programs and we have other opportunities to improve our carbon emissions in this province including in transportation b c is in a funny place because we have super clean electricity generation unlike most of the world and that means opportunities to reduce greenhouse gases have to focus on building transportation but you ve got to be careful about kicking the homeowner in the shins and telling them they ve got to convert their furnace a lot of them have already done it and it cost them a pile of money to do so tf the cleanbc plan also talks about running more transmission lines particularly in the northeast fort nelson is not on the b c hydro grid at all and that goes for that whole corner of the province i m looking for something in this you might support aw there will be more electrification of b c but it s got to be done in a way that works for consumers we re going to see more electric cars but that means you ve got to put in more power grid and more 240 volt charging stations including in people s homes that all costs a lot of money and so we re looking for a credible plan from the ndp to talk about how they re going to do this without breaking the bank of the taxpayer or the individual vehicle owner or homeowner and they seem to have forgotten that those three are the same person tf what s your priority for 2020 aw we re looking at a very exciting round of nomination races in b c we have a huge interest in people running for this party especially in ridings that are currently held by the ndp that used to be held by the b c liberals we ve opened up that nomination process for 11 ridings already and we expect to have some exciting contests in the first half of 2020 we ll have another batch in the latter half of 2020 tf public construction large projects with a monopoly of selected unions the government insists that the pattullo bridge project is on budget and things are looking wonderful on the highway 1 widening projects east of kamloops is this going to be limited to roads and bridges aw the ndp s union friendly approach to exclude 85 per cent of construction workers from major projects seems to be proceeding and a great example is highway 1 east of revelstoke where the extra money allocated for two km of highway to cover their union friends exceeds the entire budget of the ministry of mental health and addictions 22 million in cost overruns in rogers pass as against 20 million for mental health and addictions when 5 000 british columbians have died of drug overdoses in the last three years this is a huge problem and the ndp don t seem to have their priorities right tf do you think the union public construction will go to projects other than roads and bridges aw we re seeing how much the ndp are under the thumb of big labour on the western forest products labour dispute where the united steelworkers are telling them what to do if that continues into the construction sector we re going to see all kinds of public projects coming under the thumb of their 19 favoured union locals we re going to run out of money to pay these fancy prices on projects that could be done more cost efficiently and secondly it s hard

this is part of the series 31 persuasion tips that i learned from scott adams if perception outweighs words well we need to think about this and maybe be a little more strategic in the same way that facts are not persuasive how people view your intentions might be more important than what you actually say let me say it a different way voters care more about how they feel a politician is looking out for them than what specific policy the politician is for or against your boss is probably the same way it matters more how you are perceived in general than how you performed on project x words are cheap you have to make people believe in you this makes sense

amanda m countryman colorado state university president donald trump and democratic leaders agreed on a deal to pass a new trade agreement between the u s mexico and canada that will update nafta passing the new trade accord known as the u s mexico canada agreement is a substantial win for both trump given it s one of his campaign promises and democrats who want to show they re legislating even after they voted to impeach the president so how is the usmca different from the north american free trade agreement and why should you care although the final revised text of the usmca has not yet been released the deal as detailed in may contains numerous tweaks from its predecessor both big and small as an agriculture economist who studies trade i believe three changes are especially noteworthy please pass the butter since 1994 the u s and canada have dropped tariffs and other trade restrictions on most agricultural products but there were a few exceptions most notably dairy dairy was a particularly problematic sticking point in year long negotiations between the three countries the u s and canada both have long histories of protectionist policies such as subsidizing dairy farmers and setting import quotas on milk canadian tariffs on some products can be as high as 300 the new usmca begins to change that representing a small but important win for both countries especially the u s under the new accord canada will curb some of the ways it protects its dairy industry such as allowing more american milk butter cheese and other dairy products to enter canada duty free with reciprocal treatment for canadian dairy exports to the u s made in north america the new agreement also made big changes for auto manufacturers in hopes of ensuring more vehicles and parts are made in north america starting as early as 2020 to qualify for zero tariffs when crossing borders a car or truck must have 75 of its components manufactured in canada the u s or mexico up from 62 5 currently even more noteworthy negotiators agreed to a new requirement that 40 to 45 of a vehicle s components must be made by workers earning at least us 16 per hour which is about three times more than the average wage currently earned by mexican auto workers this change is huge particularly for low paid workers in mexico but it may lead to challenges over the enforcement of labor laws and increase the cost of cars made in all three countries keeping up with the times society has experienced significant technological changes since nafta was implemented in 1994 back then the internet was still in its infancy while smartphones and self driving cars were barely imaginable that s why modernization updating rules and standards to keep up with the times is a critical and positive update to the trade deal tying the north american continent together while nafta was the first trade treaty to include intellectual property protections the high pace of innovation has made modernization of its provisions imperative the new agreement includes stronger protections for patents and trademarks in areas such as biotech financial services and domain names all of which have advanced considerably over the past quarter century it also contains new provisions governing the expansion of digital trade and investment in innovative products and services separately negotiators agreed to update labor and environmental standards which were not central to the 1994 accord and are now typical in modern trade agreements examples include enforcing a minimum wage for autoworkers stricter environmental standards for mexican trucks and new rules on fishing to protect marine life apart from the changes there is one important thing about the original nafta that will stay thanks to the insistence of canada chapter 19 is the dispute settlement mechanism that allows countries to seek remedies for breaking the rules it s like trade court and makes it much easier to challenge another country s policies although mexico s senate ratified the usmca earlier this year the deal still needed approval from canada and the u s congress democrats and labor unions insisted on revisions to the text to address enforcement of labor and environmental provisions and intellectual property protection the newly revised text agreed to by trump and the democrats addresses these issues and is now ready for approval by all three countries all in all i believe the new nafta is definitely a modern and updated version of its important predecessor which the u s department of agriculture characterized as one of the most successful trade agreements in history this article is republished from the conversation under a creative commons license

b c liberal leader has party renewal plans for 2020 black press legislature reporter tom fletcher sat down with b c liberal leader andrew wilkinson for a year end interview to discuss the b c government s 2019 record and his expectations for the coming year an edited transcript follows tf you ve been focused on the troubles of the forest industry and i ll start with the b c interior what practically can a provincial government do in this situation aw talking to forest workers in quesnel and williams lake and prince george they are pretty frustrated that this government is paying no attention whatsoever to their concerns with thousands of people facing christmas with no income the obvious question that comes from forest workers throughout b c is why do we have the highest log costs in north america the stumpage rates are set in a one year delay whereas in alberta they re set every month so the story comes back that the forest workers are busy in alberta and they re facing an idle and impoverished christmas here in b c we re seeing massive slowdowns at least 90 curtailments and permanent shutdowns across the province this year a six month long strike at western forest products on vancouver island and the provincial government has done nothing people are wondering what s going to happen to their livelihood because their houses are declining in value and they ve got bank loans tf we ve had constant warnings from the ndp government about provoking the americans by lowering stumpage is that still valid aw it s a concern when our government said they don t want to provoke the americans by adjusting stumpage but they ve already adjusted it in alberta with no adverse effects so what s going on with our forests minister he s reluctant to meet with forest communities because he knows he ll get told off unemployed people don t want to hear excuses they want answers tf the employer health tax is in effect with payments due on march 31 2020 and medical services plan payments are ending jan 1 premier john horgan says calls this one of the biggest tax cuts in b c history aw he seems to have forgotten about the 25 per cent income tax cut that gordon campbell brought in in 2001 tf and revenues did recover aw yes because the economy recovered after a decade of the ndp s catastrophic economic policy tf at this stage nobody s defending the collection of msp are they aw there s no prospect of msp premiums coming back the problem we ve got now is that the ndp has now piled on 19 new or increased taxes most of which hit small business and small business is by far the biggest economic driver in b c with 98 per cent of employment combined with property taxes they re driving people out of retail they re driving employment outside b c because of the heavy taxation here a lot of manufacturers are saying they re going to move out of b c tf they did reduce the small business income tax but the large corporate tax went up meanwhile the u s cut corporate taxes substantially we hear the premier talking about big forest companies reducing operations here and buying mills in the southern u s part of that is timber supply and market but there has to be an effect as businesses ask how much tax they have to pay to function and employ people outlook 2020 john horgan on forests union labour and icbc related strata rental bans escape speculation tax until 2021 related b c carbon tax increased now raises nearly 2 billion aw it s pretty obvious that john horgan doesn t get it we have the highest log costs in north america new taxes and a 40 drop in corporate income taxes in the u s so businesses look at leaving b c particularly in the forest industry tf so is that going in your 2021 platform reduce corporate taxes aw we re going to be pushing the ndp hard to figure out what they re going to do if anything in the forest industry and to try to make b c genuinely more affordable they ran on the promise of affordability there s no improvement in the cost of housing they ve driven up costs for just about everybody with icbc premiums and they ve made it very tough for people under 35 who are probably the first generation of british columbians who are going to see a decline in their standard of living tf in urban areas we re starting to see a decline in housing prices was the empty homes tax not the right thing to do aw b c has a major problem in that about 60 000 people arrive here every year that s been true since the 1960s the population grows predictably but the supply of housing is not growing whether you re in fernie or revelstoke or kelowna or metro vancouver or parts of victoria there s a major shortage of housing particularly rental housing the ndp s approach is to destroy the value of housing to try and drive down the cost that doesn t do anything about supply we need to build more housing in b c households are smaller more people are arriving and there s nowhere for them to live tf when the b c liberals were in government you talked about the difficulty of getting municipal zoning and paying development charges and all of that is anything being done and what would you propose there aw we ve seen no movement at all from john horgan and the ndp on making it easier to get things done in municipalities the existing rules which are written by the provincial government are way too onerous so you get this extended permit process and things take years before you can get anything done on the ground we need to streamline that tf one of the taxes that s going up is carbon tax and there is no more corresponding reduction in personal or business income tax and now we have what s being advertised on tv as cleanbc parts of that are ok aren t they aw the carbon tax when it came in was supposed to be revenue neutral now we find it s just become a tax grab the ndp say don t worry we use the money we grab from you at the gas pump and your heating bill and we ll use it for cleanbc but it turns out only a small proportion of the money is going to this cleanbc thing we have no idea what difference it s going to make to daily life and so we have to wonder if they re really serious about this or if it s just greenwashing the ndp agenda tf they talk about energy efficient buildings and that includes phasing out natural gas for home heating it s ok to sell it to korea and china but not to use it here is that realistic aw b c has a major asset in high quality gas fields in the peace river country we have a very efficient existing pipeline system that works flawlessly and we have millions of clean burning furnaces and barbecues all over b c that people rely upon and enjoy if someone s going to tell them that individual homeowners have to spend thousands of dollars to convert their heating systems there had better be a good answer about who s going to pay for that tf the plan is to subsidize the purchase of electric heat pumps to replace natural gas furnaces aw this reminds me of a federal program in 2004 when my family spent 9 000 on a high efficiency furnace and got 1 500 back you ve got to have a lot of money sitting in your pocket to invest in these fancy programs and we have other opportunities to improve our carbon emissions in this province including in transportation b c is in a funny place because we have super clean electricity generation unlike most of the world and that means opportunities to reduce greenhouse gases have to focus on building transportation but you ve got to be careful about kicking the homeowner in the shins and telling them they ve got to convert their furnace a lot of them have already done it and it cost them a pile of money to do so tf the cleanbc plan also talks about running more transmission lines particularly in the northeast fort nelson is not on the b c hydro grid at all and that goes for that whole corner of the province i m looking for something in this you might support aw there will be more electrification of b c but it s got to be done in a way that works for consumers we re going to see more electric cars but that means you ve got to put in more power grid and more 240 volt charging stations including in people s homes that all costs a lot of money and so we re looking for a credible plan from the ndp to talk about how they re going to do this without breaking the bank of the taxpayer or the individual vehicle owner or homeowner and they seem to have forgotten that those three are the same person tf what s your priority for 2020 aw we re looking at a very exciting round of nomination races in b c we have a huge interest in people running for this party especially in ridings that are currently held by the ndp that used to be held by the b c liberals we ve opened up that nomination process for 11 ridings already and we expect to have some exciting contests in the first half of 2020 we ll have another batch in the latter half of 2020 tf public construction large projects with a monopoly of selected unions the government insists that the pattullo bridge project is on budget and things are looking wonderful on the highway 1 widening projects east of kamloops is this going to be limited to roads and bridges aw the ndp s union friendly approach to exclude 85 per cent of construction workers from major projects seems to be proceeding and a great example is highway 1 east of revelstoke where the extra money allocated for two km of highway to cover their union friends exceeds the entire budget of the ministry of mental health and addictions 22 million in cost overruns in rogers pass as against 20 million for mental health and addictions when 5 000 british columbians have died of drug overdoses in the last three years this is a huge problem and the ndp don t seem to have their priorities right tf do you think the union public construction will go to projects other than roads and bridges aw we re seeing how much the ndp are under the thumb of big

arvind panagariya is director of the raj center on indian economic policies and professor of economics at columbia university pravin krishna is professor of international economics and business at the johns hopkins university less more ap you re listening to the transforming india podcast jointly brought to you by the deepak and neera raj center on indian economic policies at columbia university and the times of india i am arvind panagariya director of the raj center and professor of economics at columbia my co host on this podcast is professor pravin krishna he is a professor of international economics and business at johns hopkins university welcome pravin listen to the podcast here pk hi arvind delighted to join you again for the seventh episode of this podcast as we continue to discuss indian economic policies ap yes pravin and today we are joined by naushad forbes of forbes marshall he is also the former president of the confederation of indian industry and a prominent industrialist as well as a public intellectual in india welcome naushad nf thank you ap so naushad you and your company has been there in india for a very long time and you have been operating in the environment both before the liberalization in 1991 and after that so i thought we would begin at least this conversation with your impression of how things evolved over time so maybe if you would get this started by telling us a little about forbes marshall nf sure so forbes marshall has its origins in 1946 my father joined my mother s father to start an engineering business and initially from 1946 to 1958 we were basically a selling company in india for products that were made in the uk we started manufacturing in 1958 ap so i take it you had to get some licenses nf so in 1958 it was pre license but it was just about the time when licenses started coming in so the first operations we did we didn t have to get licenses but within a few years we started to have to get licenses when my father started the business he started with a huge amount of idealism we were one of the first companies in the new country that had just received independence but we ve also had a strong outward orientation we started representing foreign firms so we ve always seen foreign firms as natural partners of indian industry and not as people to be kept out we think we should as a country always be welcoming of foreign investment and foreign activity in the country nf it was really after the exchange crisis in the mid 60s that there was a real ban on imports of products we were at that time importing products and selling them in india and that gave a real spur to manufacturing we started making more and more products but they were all built around technology that came from our foreign partners we formed two more joint ventures all with british companies those required licenses and the licenses were easy to get things were very open my father talks a lot about going to meet people in delhi going to meet people in the local government and administration the whole system was actually very supportive and encouraging of industry in the 70s under indira gandhi things changed quite significantly and we found as we tried to go into new areas that there were more and more restrictions on what we could do we found for example my father had this agreement worked out to make something called ph electrodes in india which was a very sophisticated product at the time and he had this amazing deal worked out with a swiss company which was sort of a world leader in the area where the swiss company said well here are the designs go ahead and make them and we ll form a joint venture ap so they transfer you the technology for no charge nf that s right and we struggled for five years and we were never able to get approval for the joint venture because there was one lab in chandigarh that said we have the technology to make ph electrodes why are you going to a swiss company ap ah domestic availability angle nf yup so we struggled we went we visited the lab we said great let s have a look when we went to the lab they said well we said so but we don t actually have anything we have some ideas of what we can do but we don t really have anything so we said can you say so so we can go ahead with the joint venture no we can t say so because then we ll lose our budget so we had this thing where we didn t get the joint venture ap so this was a government funded lab nf this was a csr lab nf i grew up with these kinds of stories around the dining table about these restrictions around what we could do for apparently no logical reason i joined the business in 1986 after finishing my degrees ap tell our listeners a little bit about your education nf i did a bachelor s degree in industrial engineering and history at stanford then a master s in industrial engineering and a phd in technical entrepreneurship in india was the subject of the thesis and really that thesis gave me my first significant exposure to economic policy in a ground up way we were just focused on studying technical entrepreneurship in pune and so i went around and interviewed 45 entrepreneurs all largely technical i heard stories of success but i heard stories also of struggling with the local bureaucracies struggling with controls i heard stories also of companies that got their start because of the perversity of some of the controls ap of course nf where it created space for some of these companies to get started ap the way the environment was at that time was that if anything was imported and you said i will manufacture this product at home they would stop the imports for you nf exactly this was also a time when we had incredibly high tariffs typically the import duties on the products that we made if they were allowed to be imported were around 400 ap 1986 you said you joined the business nf yes ap so maybe we pick up the story back nf sure so in the first five years i spent a lot of time on delivery performance and the reason is that at that time delivery performance i would say of us as a firm and of the indian engineering industry in general was awful one of the first cases that i got involved in was an order that we had for 21 large safety valves from the vizag steel plant now the vizag steel plant was a project that was initiated by prime minister nehru this is the late 80s we were over one year late in supplying those safety valves having supplied the safety valves and each one was a real pain to make because we had to do everything in the country imports of everything were banned and when we finally supplied the last one the commissioning of those safety valves came up two years after we supplied the last one so we were a year late commissioning came up two years later and the plant was inaugurated by prime minister narsimha rao foundation laid in the late 60s plant inaugurated in the early 90s that was the way the industry worked at that time it worked at a pace that was thoroughly glacial and it was because you had these huge tariffs you could survive as a firm all of this changed in 1991 ap so let s walk through that so 1991 comes through suddenly all the licensing is dropped by prime minister narsimha rao both on imports at least of imports of intermediate inputs and capital goods which is what you were doing also the investment licensing is gone nf so starting in the late 80s there was some liberalization that took place things started imports were allowed on something called open general license some of our products were on open general license but some of products still weren t for example we made something called a silica analyzer we only sold six silica analyzers these are to power plants in a year but because the imports of printed circuit boards populated and bare printed circuit boards were banned forget the tariff you just couldn t import them we had to make six printed circuit boards a volume of six so we had to develop all the printed circuit boards to make six printed circuit boards a year much more expensive than simply importing them ap and you couldn t compete on the world market so you couldn t have done it on a large scale even if you wanted to do it nf that s right we were just not competitive so you had these kinds of skills that built up some of them were useful but some of them were useless ap at a very high resource cost nf at very high resource cost this is what our engineers spent their time doing so in the course of doing a lot of this indigenization we built decent engineering skills and the engineering skills then started becoming quite useful to us later on so 1991 is a landmark year it s a landmark year for us as a country of course but it was a landmark year with a very specific sort of launch date for us manmohan singh s budget speech of june 1991 to both my brother and me it came like a revelation to us it was the first time here was an indian political leader saying as a country we need to change direction he started by saying that this was a speech to fulfill the aspirations of prime minister nehru but having said that in the budget speech what he was actually doing and announcing in the budget speech were things that were changing direction for the country completely and ap this is what i wrote in one of my papers actually very early on in 1994 i did this paper and that s exactly how i read that speech nf exactly exactly it s a great speech but it s a speech that sort of pays tribute to nehru it doesn t mention indira gandhi it comes straight to rajiv for a good reason because i think indira gandhi sort of damaged us as a country for decades on the economic side she set us back by decades as a country that budget speech was to us a marker of a new direction within two weeks of the budget speech my brother and i we said we have to work on a bunch of things and within two weeks we had these discussions with the top management of the company and we decided on three new directions first we did a review of all the products that we made and we said ok tariffs are coming down now the tariffs that came down at that time came down to a maximum tariff of 200 now 200 is an absurdly high tariff but it s a lot better than 400 and it s a lot better than having imports banned for certain categories of items so 1991 everything that we made could be imported but with a tariff of ranging between a 100 and 200 typically at that time so the first question we asked was if the tariff is zero what would we still make and what would we not be competitive in and need to stop making and we essentially concluded that between a third and half of all the products we made we would not be competitive making so we said fine this is the half that we need to focus on and the other half as it goes away with tariffs going away let them go away as products that we make ap is it your sense that your contemporary companies were doing something similar or you were quite unique nf i think other companies also did an analysis of product portfolio but the other two things i think that we did we said let s set up an international department to export our products and at that time we sold less than 1 of what we did oversees and it was by accident we got an order from some country and we said why did we decide to do it not actually because at that time of the attractiveness of international markets we did it because we said foreign companies were going to be coming to india right foreign investment was now going to be welcomed instead of being deterred earlier on and we said well if foreign companies are going to come and compete with us in india the best way of ensuring that we are competitive with them is to compete with them outside india because that will teach us how to compete with them at home so we said let s invest in international as a way of improving our own competitiveness the third thing that we did which i think was unique for the engineering industry at that time was we completely rethought r d now this tied in very nicely with my own academic field which was sort of technology in developing countries and i said here we actually have an opportunity to actually implement what i have been teaching right on investing in technology how you build technical capability in a firm how you build technical capability and then start using it for the firm s long run competitiveness until 1991 r d for us meant one word indigenization if it was imported do it locally and we said fine from now onwards any project we take up has to be for the world market so it cannot be to develop a product only for india there is no point in doing that any longer that complete change in direction in r d for the first three years we got nothing out we had some really bright good engineers who joined us at that time and who we recruited from different places and we started building capabilities of product development and about three years out we started seeing a flow of new products coming out and that capability has become absolutely core to our success through to now and i think those three new directions you know what would we make if completely free imports are allowed how do we compete internationally and what do we do in r d to build our own proprietary technical capability such that we can operate internationally i think those three new directions that we set on after hearing manmohan singh s budget speech have been the foundation of our success ap my own recollection of the 1990s are that indians were so skeptical of liberalization and you know what would happen is that you would look in the composition of exports and so forth at the relatively aggregate level one digit classification maybe and you would not see a lot of change in the composition a lot of this gets hidden because quality changes lot of these other things happen from that perspective i think your experience is very fascinating nf but you know it was an interesting time also because well manmohan singh had a chief economic advisor ashok desai and ashok is still a good friend i wrote him a fan letter having read something i really liked that he had written and manmohan singh brought him in to the government as his chief economic advisor in 1991 and ashok describes that time as saying you know the people who he d basically been writing critical comments about in terms of economic thinking and policies suddenly found that he was their boss and so he was there for about two years and one of the things he did at that time was that he put me as a 31 year old on this group that would come to the pre budget meeting with the finance minister each year the first meeting that i went to in 1992 i was seated between ratan tata and mukesh ambani i suddenly found that i was on the front page of a lot of newspapers thanks only to that one fact when i used to go to those meetings i went for five years at the meetings i would always make this comment listen you know we ve been protected as an industry for 40 years we ve learnt how to compete and the sooner we reduce tariffs the better for indian industry because it ll force us to be competitive ap and tariffs continued to come down nf and tariffs came down and at the end of each session when we would meet manmohan singh and he would say bye to us he would always say to me keep saying the things you re saying the voice of the cii president in those meetings was always a voice for openness and i learned much after the fact that was very much part of the institution and the role it played at that time in encouraging the reform process and in taking a stand that was strongly in favor of liberalization and opening up the indian economy ap so let me come to this from one another angle so as we know pre 1991 the government was very much involved in manufacturing activity it did so in two ways one was it reserved certain industries for itself these were public sector monopolies post liberalization what was a change from that perspective nf sure we get business from different industrial customers about 50 of our business in 1991 came from public sector companies you compare that to today less than 10 of our business comes from public sector companies the reason is that over the years the public sector share in industrial output has dropped nf because the private sector is growing and today except for the oil refining sector the public sector is not a significant share of any of manufacturing one of the results of opening up in 1991 for us as a firm were incredibly positive you know throughout the 90s we grew 30 40 a year and then there was a slowdown late 90s early 2000s when you know growth came down essentially it was either flat or 0 5 6 for a few years and then again in 2000s we grew at 30 40 a year ap that was of course for the whole country a period of tremendous growth nf that s right so we only have a positive view of the liberalization the opening up what it did to us as a firm and what it did to our customers as i mentioned our share of business from the public sector came down but even among private sector firms firms that we used to sell to and firms that we sell to now are very different firms that we used to sell to many of these are these old style firms you know the modi s and the singhania s there were a group of firms that dominated certain industry segments and some of these went away i mean some of those disappeared in the 90s as they couldn t compete as the economy opened up and many new firms and new entrants came in the pharmaceutical industry is about 15 of our total business it was tiny in 1991 food processing is probably 25 of our total business today tiny in 1991 ap this is very interesting also because a lot of the people have this view this very romantic view that somehow the pharmaceutical industry did very well because we had this protection back in the starting in the early 1970s when mrs gandhi sort of ended the product patent on chemicals and pharmaceuticals which may have some grain of truth nf it gave many of these firms their start i think the fact that we didn t have product patents for many of these firms until 2005 and i think that it gave many of these pharmaceutical firms their start but the ones that thrive and continue to thrive now built real capabilities ap but the real stuff seems to have come after liberalization right nf yes very much ap 1970 to 2000 if you take it a 60 year period very limited gains even for industries that had been protected so much that eventually succeeded liberalization was really critical to their success nf absolutely absolutely and i think it s a great thing that you re doing these podcasts because i think we forget how much the country has been transformed ap that s right nf as a result of the opening up and how bad those days were and i think in the last two or three years we ve seen actually a return of tariffs in certain areas and import tariffs being brought in in different areas like steel and so on and i think we have to be very careful to not go back in that direction again and i worry especially that some of my friends in industry keep demanding tariffs and people in industry often do demand tariffs and i think the role of the government is to hear them and then act in the national interest and the national interest is not to have those tariffs and there are anti dumping measures and so on that one can use legitimately if you have dumping taking place in the country but that s not a justification for long term tariffs which i think it ends up making the local industry less competitive nf so i think it s something for us to view with some danger and i think as in the case for free trade as you ve done in your book is very important and reminding people that as industry today we re a lot more successful than we would otherwise have been i ll give you an example of one firm i m on the board of bajaj auto bajaj auto exports 40 of their output today in over 70 countries of the world they have a very significant share of the domestic market this would not have been possible without the kind of liberalization that s taken place ap absolutely that s one side of it on the other side of it is that even though the auto industry is bitterly complaining you talk to rajiv bajaj and he s not disturbed in the least he says i can compete in the world market if domestic demand is a bit weak i ve still got the world demand and since i m competitive in that market i can do it not so for the auto industry which has had the kind of protection that we used to have prior to 1991 the only difference for the auto industry pre and post 1991 is that post 91 we allowed foreign investment to come to india and that we ended the licensing we also ended the investment licensing so some competition happened as a result the auto industry did grow but it grew very much like a nontraded industry its dependent entirely on the domestic demand its share in the world market is less than 1 nf and if you talk to people in the auto industry in the car industry they ll tell you that india is the most competitive country to make small cars and my answer is if india is the most competitive country to make small cars why then do you need protection ap exactly and if you do have the protection then show me in your exports if you really truly are competitive then you ought to be having some 4 5 share in the global exports nf correct the only company that actually is a significant exporter of cars from india is hyundai but for two wheelers fortunately we have a huge success story bajaj auto ap exactly so as we wind up the session today maybe some thoughts on the current situation and where you think the government ought to go nf so we ve talked about tariffs already and that s one specific point i think learning from the whole liberalization process one of the things i really enjoyed was actually being engaged in policy areas one of the things that i most appreciated was that all of the people i met in the government were committed really wanted to do the right thing and were very hardworking and focused on what they wanted to achieve what i also realized at the time was that the bandwidth once you got below the level of a secretary or a joint secretary in a department the bandwidth to actually do anything is quite limited so my conclusion is actually not a political conclusion at all my conclusion is given that the government has very limited bandwidth it needs to focus and needs to focus on just two or three things that are very significant and not 20 different things because if it tries to do 20 different things it will probably not achieve any of them while if it focuses on these two or three things and focuses also its political capital on these two or three things it can really make a change so we have without question a need to worry about the financial sector both fixing it and i think reforming it 100 we should be moving on privatization of public sector banks and if there are now going to be 12 large public sector banks we don t need to do all 12 at the same time we can start with the three smallest of the 12 see what happens learn from that experience and then see what to do with the nine remaining so we i think need to focus our reforming efforts on a few areas and bring about some substantial change so privatization without question is a big opportunity and i think given the current resource constraints we are operating in in the economy it will also provide a flow of funds that will enable us to fund many other work programs the program that we have of moving from a subsidy in kind regime to direct benefit transfers we have many success stories of the last five years i think we should learn from those and expand that so the fertilizer subsidy continues to remain largely a producer subsidy it should become a direct benefit transfer to farmer i think there is lots that can be done on the trade side one is import tariffs without question but i think also engaging with on the free trade agreement area one is we ve got rcep nf so the importance of rcep for us in the long run as a country is vital today many of our leading companies may be india focused but 10 years out the indian market may not be big enough for them they will want to be outside and when they want to be outside they will want to be in the most dynamic region of the world which is asia so they will want to be in rcep even if they don t have an interest in it today and we have to see what our interests are as an industry over the next 25 years and sign rcep on that basis ap yeah and rcep is not like you are going to eliminate tariffs tomorrow nf we have a 25 year period 5 10 15 20 and 25 years of adjustment that are provided so it is long and then we should engage with other countries we should engage with the africa free trade agreements there is a real opportunity for india throughout africa there are opportunities for us in south america we should engage there and we should engage of course as we are doing now with the us and eu with the eu i think the negotiations on an fta have been running over 15 years i think finding some traction to conclude that sooner rather than later would be a good idea because it will help us particularly in industries we will need like garment and textiles the market is in europe the market is in the us and we re at a disadvantage in selling to these markets because a bangladesh or a vietnam have duty free access and our garments come with a tariff of at least 10 so there are some obvious trade opportunities for us as a country and if we keep that perspective of wanting to work from a policy side the firms that are competitive want to be competitive in the world that want to have a good leading international position in the world and policy should focus on them and not on those firms that want to be protected and want to stay at home ap this brings us to the end of

b c liberal leader has party renewal plans for 2020 black press legislature reporter tom fletcher sat down with b c liberal leader andrew wilkinson for a year end interview to discuss the b c government s 2019 record and his expectations for the coming year an edited transcript follows tf you ve been focused on the troubles of the forest industry and i ll start with the b c interior what practically can a provincial government do in this situation aw talking to forest workers in quesnel and williams lake and prince george they are pretty frustrated that this government is paying no attention whatsoever to their concerns with thousands of people facing christmas with no income the obvious question that comes from forest workers throughout b c is why do we have the highest log costs in north america the stumpage rates are set in a one year delay whereas in alberta they re set every month so the story comes back that the forest workers are busy in alberta and they re facing an idle and impoverished christmas here in b c we re seeing massive slowdowns at least 90 curtailments and permanent shutdowns across the province this year a six month long strike at western forest products on vancouver island and the provincial government has done nothing people are wondering what s going to happen to their livelihood because their houses are declining in value and they ve got bank loans tf we ve had constant warnings from the ndp government about provoking the americans by lowering stumpage is that still valid aw it s a concern when our government said they don t want to provoke the americans by adjusting stumpage but they ve already adjusted it in alberta with no adverse effects so what s going on with our forests minister he s reluctant to meet with forest communities because he knows he ll get told off unemployed people don t want to hear excuses they want answers tf the employer health tax is in effect with payments due on march 31 2020 and medical services plan payments are ending jan 1 premier john horgan says calls this one of the biggest tax cuts in b c history aw he seems to have forgotten about the 25 per cent income tax cut that gordon campbell brought in in 2001 tf and revenues did recover aw yes because the economy recovered after a decade of the ndp s catastrophic economic policy tf at this stage nobody s defending the collection of msp are they aw there s no prospect of msp premiums coming back the problem we ve got now is that the ndp has now piled on 19 new or increased taxes most of which hit small business and small business is by far the biggest economic driver in b c with 98 per cent of employment combined with property taxes they re driving people out of retail they re driving employment outside b c because of the heavy taxation here a lot of manufacturers are saying they re going to move out of b c tf they did reduce the small business income tax but the large corporate tax went up meanwhile the u s cut corporate taxes substantially we hear the premier talking about big forest companies reducing operations here and buying mills in the southern u s part of that is timber supply and market but there has to be an effect as businesses ask how much tax they have to pay to function and employ people outlook 2020 john horgan on forests union labour and icbc related strata rental bans escape speculation tax until 2021 related b c carbon tax increased now raises nearly 2 billion aw it s pretty obvious that john horgan doesn t get it we have the highest log costs in north america new taxes and a 40 drop in corporate income taxes in the u s so businesses look at leaving b c particularly in the forest industry tf so is that going in your 2021 platform reduce corporate taxes aw we re going to be pushing the ndp hard to figure out what they re going to do if anything in the forest industry and to try to make b c genuinely more affordable they ran on the promise of affordability there s no improvement in the cost of housing they ve driven up costs for just about everybody with icbc premiums and they ve made it very tough for people under 35 who are probably the first generation of british columbians who are going to see a decline in their standard of living tf in urban areas we re starting to see a decline in housing prices was the empty homes tax not the right thing to do aw b c has a major problem in that about 60 000 people arrive here every year that s been true since the 1960s the population grows predictably but the supply of housing is not growing whether you re in fernie or revelstoke or kelowna or metro vancouver or parts of victoria there s a major shortage of housing particularly rental housing the ndp s approach is to destroy the value of housing to try and drive down the cost that doesn t do anything about supply we need to build more housing in b c households are smaller more people are arriving and there s nowhere for them to live tf when the b c liberals were in government you talked about the difficulty of getting municipal zoning and paying development charges and all of that is anything being done and what would you propose there aw we ve seen no movement at all from john horgan and the ndp on making it easier to get things done in municipalities the existing rules which are written by the provincial government are way too onerous so you get this extended permit process and things take years before you can get anything done on the ground we need to streamline that tf one of the taxes that s going up is carbon tax and there is no more corresponding reduction in personal or business income tax and now we have what s being advertised on tv as cleanbc parts of that are ok aren t they aw the carbon tax when it came in was supposed to be revenue neutral now we find it s just become a tax grab the ndp say don t worry we use the money we grab from you at the gas pump and your heating bill and we ll use it for cleanbc but it turns out only a small proportion of the money is going to this cleanbc thing we have no idea what difference it s going to make to daily life and so we have to wonder if they re really serious about this or if it s just greenwashing the ndp agenda tf they talk about energy efficient buildings and that includes phasing out natural gas for home heating it s ok to sell it to korea and china but not to use it here is that realistic aw b c has a major asset in high quality gas fields in the peace river country we have a very efficient existing pipeline system that works flawlessly and we have millions of clean burning furnaces and barbecues all over b c that people rely upon and enjoy if someone s going to tell them that individual homeowners have to spend thousands of dollars to convert their heating systems there had better be a good answer about who s going to pay for that tf the plan is to subsidize the purchase of electric heat pumps to replace natural gas furnaces aw this reminds me of a federal program in 2004 when my family spent 9 000 on a high efficiency furnace and got 1 500 back you ve got to have a lot of money sitting in your pocket to invest in these fancy programs and we have other opportunities to improve our carbon emissions in this province including in transportation b c is in a funny place because we have super clean electricity generation unlike most of the world and that means opportunities to reduce greenhouse gases have to focus on building transportation but you ve got to be careful about kicking the homeowner in the shins and telling them they ve got to convert their furnace a lot of them have already done it and it cost them a pile of money to do so tf the cleanbc plan also talks about running more transmission lines particularly in the northeast fort nelson is not on the b c hydro grid at all and that goes for that whole corner of the province i m looking for something in this you might support aw there will be more electrification of b c but it s got to be done in a way that works for consumers we re going to see more electric cars but that means you ve got to put in more power grid and more 240 volt charging stations including in people s homes that all costs a lot of money and so we re looking for a credible plan from the ndp to talk about how they re going to do this without breaking the bank of the taxpayer or the individual vehicle owner or homeowner and they seem to have forgotten that those three are the same person tf what s your priority for 2020 aw we re looking at a very exciting round of nomination races in b c we have a huge interest in people running for this party especially in ridings that are currently held by the ndp that used to be held by the b c liberals we ve opened up that nomination process for 11 ridings already and we expect to have some exciting contests in the first half of 2020 we ll have another batch in the latter half of 2020 tf public construction large projects with a monopoly of selected unions the government insists that the pattullo bridge project is on budget and things are looking wonderful on the highway 1 widening projects east of kamloops is this going to be limited to roads and bridges aw the ndp s union friendly approach to exclude 85 per cent of construction workers from major projects seems to be proceeding and a great example is highway 1 east of revelstoke where the extra money allocated for two km of highway to cover their union friends exceeds the entire budget of the ministry of mental health and addictions 22 million in cost overruns in rogers pass as against 20 million for mental health and addictions when 5 000 british columbians have died of drug overdoses in the last three years this is a huge problem and the ndp don t seem to have their priorities right tf do you think the union public construction will go to projects other than roads and bridges aw we re seeing how much the ndp are under the thumb of big labour on the western forest products labour dispute where the united steelworkers are telling them what to do if that continues into the construction sector we re going to see all kinds of public projects coming under the thumb of their 19 favoured union locals we re going to run out of money to pay these fancy prices on projects that could be done more cost efficiently and secondly it s hard to point to anything the ndp government has actually built in the last two years they re good at talk and very poor at actual construction tomfletcherbc tfletcher blackpress ca like us on facebook and

b c liberal leader has party renewal plans for 2020 black press legislature reporter tom fletcher sat down with b c liberal leader andrew wilkinson for a year end interview to discuss the b c

practically can a provincial government do in this situation aw talking to forest workers in quesnel and williams lake and prince george they are pretty frustrated that this government is paying no attention whatsoever to their concerns with thousands of people facing christmas with no income the obvious question that comes from forest workers throughout b c is why do we have the highest log costs in north america the stumpage rates are set in a one year delay whereas in alberta they re set every month so the story comes back that the forest workers are busy in alberta and they re facing an idle and impoverished christmas here in b c we re seeing massive slowdowns at least 90 curtailments and permanent shutdowns across the province this year a six month long strike at western forest products on vancouver island and the provincial government has done nothing people are wondering what s going to happen to their livelihood because their houses are declining in value and they ve got bank loans tf we ve had constant warnings from the ndp government about provoking the americans by lowering stumpage is that still valid aw it s a concern when our government said they don t want to provoke the americans by adjusting stumpage but they ve already adjusted it in alberta with no adverse effects so what s going on with our forests minister he s reluctant to meet with forest communities because he knows he ll get told off unemployed people don t want to hear excuses they want answers tf the employer health tax is in effect with payments due on march 31 2020 and medical

happy friday traders welcome to our regular friday recap of the week s macroeconomic data and headlines that mattered most to the precious metals and dollar markets and the final full trading week of 2019 at that as we close out the friday session gold prices are trading a few dollars higher to 1478 oz in spot markets for the week and silver has also made gains to trade once again above 17 oz the precious metals have risen this week even as equities performed well through the week as did the us dollar index the benchmark yield on the us 10yr is even trading higher than 1 9 as we expected when putting together monday s preview it s been a pretty dull week in the markets as the large majority of investors have wound things down ahead of the holidays and the one economic narrative that could have goosed trading action the us and china s efforts to formalize an initial trade agreement had very little in the way of development rather than squeeze a full sized recap out of a dull week this time around i ll give you a brief rundown of the days interesting items before sending you off to get your last minute holiday shopping finished so what kind of week has it been monday the feel good market mood continued into a new week monday set the tone of the lackluster trading week that we ve ended up with it was clear that the optimistic mood of the prior week was carrying over propelled mostly by the announcement of the us and china s phase one trade deal but also the uk conservative party s newly won majority that appears set to finally settle all of this brexit uncertainty both of these developments have led to a sense of certainty in the market as a result risk appetite was up on monday along with most equity markets and gold prices softened a bit during the us session the one piece of trade news worth remarking on from the day white house economic advisor larry kudlow s comments to the effect that any theoretical phase two trade deal with china would be dependent on the perceived success of phase one for my money this doesn t bode very well for long term trade peace but that s a conversation for after the holidays tuesday uk conservatives took the brexit reins us manufacturing sector outperformed monday s trade based optimism would shake a little bit on tuesday with investors in europe and london finding new reasons to be concerned about old risks as report emerged that still prime minister boris johnson will seek to legally limit the post brexit transitional period to one year a great many experts who have been following the negotiations appear worried that one year is not enough time to create a comprehensive trade relationship and legal framework in this case by the second half of 2020 we ll be back to fretting about britain s risk of crashing out again this time on january 31 2021 those concerns brought about a mild rise in risk off sentiment that boosted gold prices but the yellow metal s rise was limited by another strong day for stocks and a rebounding dollar in the us on tuesday lifted by better than expected data reporting on november s manufacturing and industrial production wednesday us house of representatives voted to impeach donald trump here is what i hope is the weirdest sentence i m going to write before 2020 wednesday was a very dull news day with the exception of the successful vote to impeachment a sitting us president trade geopolitical and data headlines were all calm and quiet while equity markets sat on their hands ahead of the impeachment vote the lack of motivation saw gold prices fall to their lowest for the week south of 1475 ahead of the us market open although the yellow metal pretty swiftly rebounded above that psychological support level with the house s impeachment vote finally coming just ahead of the start to asia s wednesday session gold and other non dollar safe havens got a boost on the headlines but move was ultimately muted thursday markets took impeachment in stride dour macro data lifted gold to 1480 even major us stock markets general reaction to the impeachment vote was one collective shrug with equities trading new highs on thursday although not with any impressive momentum with an affirmative vote on impeachment by the house of representatives having been a mostly forgone conclusion for weeks now the main driver for gold trading on thursday was the only roughly spot of us economic data for the week the philly fed s manufacturing index dropped to a six month low just a breath above 0 0 and somewhat less worryingly initial jobless claims printed above 225k for a consecutive week the risk off impulse supplied by the data however light send gold prices trading as high as 1480 oz friday a quiet end to a quiet week as we move into the weekend and the start of the holidays season in the us gold prices have sold off slightly from thursday s topper on the news front the impeachment process threatens to drag on at least a little while longer and with a good bit more nonsense politicking than anticipated and this morning s consumer spending and pce inflation data arrived effectively in step with expectations giving our risk markers very little to react to since then both news flow and market trading have been just about as inert as most of the week behind us next up of course there s little reason to expect things to pick up next week or the following week really as the majority of the world s financial markets slide into the holidays and year end we ll have durable goods squeezing in under the wire on monday but trading depth will be mild and it s hard to imagine any kind of trade developments with us officials taking the week off while most of europe and the uk s governments and traders will be dark until january good luck getting the last of your holiday shopping done this weekend traders for those who are staying plugged in i ll see you next week for the rest i hope you have a very happy holidays and i look forward to talking and trading with you in 2020
b c liberal leader has party renewal plans for 2020 black press legislature reporter tom fletcher sat down with b c liberal leader andrew wilkinson for a year end interview to discuss the b c government s 2019 record and his expectations for the coming year an edited transcript follows tf you ve been focused on the troubles of the forest industry and i ll start with the b c interior what practically can a provincial government do in this situation aw talking to forest workers in quesnel and williams lake and prince george they are pretty frustrated that this government is paying no attention whatsoever to their concerns with thousands of people facing christmas with no income the obvious question that comes from forest workers throughout b c is why do we have the highest log costs in north america the stumpage rates are set in a one year delay whereas in alberta they re set every month so the story comes back that the forest workers are busy in alberta and they re facing an idle and impoverished christmas here in b c we re seeing massive slowdowns at least 90 curtailments and permanent shutdowns across the province this year a six month long strike at western forest products on vancouver island and the provincial government has done nothing people are wondering what s going to happen to their livelihood because their houses are declining in value and they ve got bank loans tf we ve had constant warnings from the ndp government about provoking the americans by lowering stumpage is that still valid aw it s a concern when our government said they don t want to provoke the americans by adjusting stumpage but they ve already adjusted it in alberta with no adverse effects so what s going on with our forests minister he s reluctant to meet with forest communities because he knows he ll get told off unemployed people don t want to hear excuses they want answers tf the employer health tax is in effect with payments due on march 31 2020 and medical services plan payments are ending jan 1 premier john horgan says calls this one of the biggest tax cuts in b c history aw he seems to have forgotten about the 25 per cent income tax cut that gordon campbell brought in in 2001 tf and revenues did recover aw yes because the economy recovered after a decade of the ndp s catastrophic economic policy tf at this stage nobody s defending the collection of msp are they aw there s no prospect of msp premiums coming back the problem we ve got now is that the ndp has now piled on 19 new or increased taxes most of which hit small business and small business is by far the biggest economic driver in b c with 98 per cent of employment combined with property taxes they re driving people out of retail they re driving employment outside b c because of the heavy taxation here a lot of manufacturers are saying they re going to move out of b c tf they did reduce the small business income tax but the large corporate tax went up meanwhile the u s cut corporate taxes substantially we hear the premier talking about big forest companies reducing operations here and buying mills in the southern u s part of that is timber supply and market but there has to be an effect as businesses ask how much tax they have to pay to function and employ people outlook 2020 john horgan on forests union labour and icbc related strata rental bans escape speculation tax until 2021 related b c carbon tax increased now raises nearly 2 billion aw it s pretty obvious that john horgan doesn t get it we have the highest log costs in north america new taxes and a 40 drop in corporate income taxes in the u s so businesses look at leaving b c particularly in the forest industry tf so is that going in your 2021 platform reduce corporate taxes aw we re going to be pushing the ndp hard to figure out what they re going to do if anything in the forest industry and to try to make b c genuinely more affordable they ran on the promise of affordability there s no improvement in the cost of housing they ve driven up costs for just about everybody with icbc premiums and they ve made it very tough for people under 35 who are probably the first generation of british columbians who are going to see a decline in their standard of living tf in urban areas we re starting to see a decline in housing prices was the empty homes tax not the right thing to do aw b c has a major problem in that about 60 000 people arrive here every year that s been true since the 1960s the population grows predictably but the supply of housing is not growing whether you re in fernie or revelstoke or kelowna or metro vancouver or parts of victoria there s a major shortage of housing particularly rental housing the ndp s approach is to destroy the value of housing to try and drive down the cost that doesn t do anything about supply we need to build more housing in b c households are smaller more people are arriving and there s nowhere for them to live tf when the b c liberals were in government you talked about the difficulty of getting municipal zoning and paying development charges and all of that is anything being done and what would you propose there aw we ve seen no movement at all from john horgan and the ndp on making it easier to get things done in municipalities the existing rules which are written by the provincial government are way too onerous so you get this extended permit process and things take years before you can get anything done on the ground we need to streamline that tf one of the taxes that s going up is carbon tax and there is no more corresponding reduction in personal or business income tax and now we have what s being advertised on tv as cleanbc parts of that are ok aren t they aw the carbon tax when it came in was supposed to be revenue neutral now we find it s just become a tax grab the ndp say don t worry we use the money we grab from you at the gas pump and your heating bill and we ll use it for cleanbc but it turns out only a small proportion of the money is going to this cleanbc thing we have no idea what difference it s going to make to daily life and so we have to wonder if they re really serious about this or if it s just greenwashing the ndp agenda tf they talk about energy efficient buildings and that includes phasing out natural gas for home heating it s ok to sell it to korea and china but not to use it here is that realistic aw b c has a major asset in high quality gas fields in the peace river country we have a very efficient existing pipeline system that works flawlessly and we have millions of clean burning furnaces and barbecues all over b c that people rely upon and enjoy if someone s going to tell them that individual homeowners have to spend thousands of dollars to convert their heating systems there had better be a good answer about who s going to pay for that tf the plan is to subsidize the purchase of electric heat pumps to replace natural gas furnaces aw this reminds me of a federal program in 2004 when my family spent 9 000 on a high efficiency furnace and got 1 500 back you ve got to have a lot of money sitting in your pocket to invest in these fancy programs and we have other opportunities to improve our carbon emissions in this province including in transportation b c is in a funny place because we have super clean electricity generation unlike most of the world and that means opportunities to reduce greenhouse gases have to focus on building transportation but you ve got to be careful about kicking the homeowner in the shins and telling them they ve got to convert their furnace a lot of them have already done it and it cost them a pile of money to do so tf the cleanbc plan also talks about running more transmission lines particularly in the northeast fort nelson is not on the b c hydro grid at all and that goes for that whole corner of the province i m looking for something in this you might support aw there will be more electrification of b c but it s got to be done in a way that works for consumers we re going to see more electric cars but that means you ve got to put in more power grid and more 240 volt charging stations including in people s homes that all costs a lot of money and so we re looking for a credible plan from the ndp to talk about how they re going to do this without breaking the bank of the taxpayer or the individual vehicle owner or homeowner and they seem to have forgotten that those three are the same person tf what s your priority for 2020 aw we re looking at a very exciting round of nomination races in b c we have a huge interest in people running for this party especially in ridings that are currently held by the ndp that used to be held by the b c liberals we ve opened up that nomination process for 11 ridings already and we expect to have some exciting contests in the first half of 2020 we ll have another batch in the latter half of 2020 tf public construction large projects with a monopoly of selected unions the government insists that the pattullo bridge project is on budget and things are looking wonderful on the highway 1 widening projects east of kamloops is this going to be limited to roads and bridges aw the ndp s union friendly approach to exclude 85 per cent of construction workers from major projects seems to be proceeding and a great example is highway 1 east of revelstoke where the extra money allocated for two km of highway to cover their union friends exceeds the entire budget of the ministry of mental health and addictions 22 million in cost overruns in rogers pass as against 20 million for mental health and addictions when 5 000 british columbians have died of drug overdoses in the last three years this is a huge problem and the ndp don t seem to have their priorities right tf do you think the union public construction will go to projects other than roads and bridges aw we re seeing how much the ndp are under the thumb of big labour on the western forest products labour dispute where the united steelworkers are telling them what to do if that continues into the construction sector we re going to see all kinds of public projects coming under the thumb of their 19 favoured union locals we re going to run out of money to pay these fancy prices on projects that could be done more cost efficiently and secondly it s hard to point to anything the ndp government has actually built in the last two years they re good at talk and very poor at actual construction tomfletcherbc tfletcher blackpress ca like us on facebook and

nomination process for 11 ridings already and we expect to have some exciting contests in the first half of 2020 we ll have another batch in the latter half of 2020 tf public construction large projects with a monopoly of selected unions the government insists that the pattullo bridge project is on budget and things are looking wonderful on the highway 1 widening projects east of kamloops is this going to be limited to roads and bridges aw the ndp s union friendly approach to exclude 85 per cent of construction workers from major projects seems to be proceeding and a great example is highway 1 east of revelstoke where the extra money allocated for two km of highway to cover their union friends exceeds the entire budget of the ministry of mental health and addictions 22 million in cost overruns in rogers pass as against 20 million for mental health and addictions when 5 000 british columbians have died of drug overdoses in the last three years this is a huge problem and the ndp don t seem to have their priorities right tf do you think the union public construction will go to projects other than roads and bridges aw we re seeing how much the ndp are under the thumb of big labour on the western forest products labour dispute where the united steelworkers are telling them what to do if that continues into the construction sector we re going to see all kinds of public projects coming under the thumb of their 19 favoured union locals we re going to run out of money to pay these fancy prices on projects that could be done more cost efficiently and secondly it s hard

b c liberal leader has party renewal plans for 2020 black press legislature reporter tom fletcher sat down with b c liberal leader andrew wilkinson for a year end interview to discuss the b c government s 2019 record and his expectations for the coming year an edited transcript follows tf you ve been focused on the troubles of the forest industry and i ll start with the b c interior what practically can a provincial government do in this situation aw talking to forest workers in quesnel and williams lake and prince george they are pretty frustrated that this government is paying no attention whatsoever to their concerns with thousands of people facing christmas with no income the obvious question that comes from forest workers throughout b c is why do we have the highest log costs in north america the stumpage rates are set in a one year delay whereas in alberta they re set every month so the story comes back that the forest workers are busy in alberta and they re facing an idle and impoverished christmas here in b c we re seeing massive slowdowns at least 90 curtailments and permanent shutdowns across the province this year a six month long strike at western forest products on vancouver island and the provincial government has done nothing people are wondering what s going to happen to their livelihood because their houses are declining in value and they ve got bank loans tf we ve had constant warnings from the ndp government about provoking the americans by lowering stumpage is that still valid aw it s a concern when our government said they don t want to provoke the americans by adjusting stumpage but they ve already adjusted it in alberta with no adverse effects so what s going on with our forests minister he s reluctant to meet with forest communities because he knows he ll get told off unemployed people don t want to hear excuses they want answers tf the employer health tax is in effect with payments due on march 31 2020 and medical services plan payments are ending jan 1 premier john horgan says calls this one of the biggest tax cuts in b c history aw he seems to have forgotten about the 25 per cent income tax cut that gordon campbell brought in in 2001 tf and revenues did recover aw yes because the economy recovered after a decade of the ndp s catastrophic economic policy tf at this stage nobody s defending the collection of msp are they aw there s no prospect of msp premiums coming back the problem we ve got now is that the ndp has now piled on 19 new or increased taxes most of which hit small business and small business is by far the biggest economic driver in b c with 98 per cent of employment combined with property taxes they re driving people out of retail they re driving employment outside b c because of the heavy taxation here a lot of manufacturers are saying they re going to move out of b c tf they did reduce the small business income tax but the large corporate tax went up meanwhile the u s cut corporate taxes substantially we hear the premier talking about big forest companies reducing operations here and buying mills in the southern u s part of that is timber supply and market but there has to be an effect as businesses ask how much tax they have to pay to function and employ people outlook 2020 john horgan on forests union labour and icbc related strata rental bans escape speculation tax until 2021 related b c carbon tax increased now raises nearly 2 billion aw it s pretty obvious that john horgan doesn t get it we have the highest log costs in north america new taxes and a 40 drop in corporate income taxes in the u s so businesses look at leaving b c particularly in the forest industry tf so is that going in your 2021 platform reduce corporate taxes aw we re going to be pushing the ndp hard to figure out what they re going to do if anything in the forest industry and to try to make b c genuinely more affordable they ran on the promise of affordability there s no improvement in the cost of housing they ve driven up costs for just about everybody with icbc premiums and they ve made it very tough for people under 35 who are probably the first generation of british columbians who are going to see a decline in their standard of living tf in urban areas we re starting to see a decline in housing prices was the empty homes tax not the right thing to do aw b c has a major problem in that about 60 000 people arrive here every year that s been true since the 1960s the population grows predictably but the supply of housing is not growing whether you re in fernie or revelstoke or kelowna or metro vancouver or parts of victoria there s a major shortage of housing particularly rental housing the ndp s approach is to destroy the value of housing to try and drive down the cost that doesn t do anything about supply we need to build more housing in b c households are smaller more people are arriving and there s nowhere for them to live tf when the b c liberals were in government you talked about the difficulty of getting municipal zoning and paying development charges and all of that is anything being done and what would you propose there aw we ve seen no movement at all from john horgan and the ndp on making it easier to get things done in municipalities the existing rules which are written by the provincial government are way too onerous so you get this extended permit process and things take years before you can get anything done on the ground we need to streamline that tf one of the taxes that s going up is carbon tax and there is no more corresponding reduction in personal or business income tax and now we have what s being advertised on tv as cleanbc parts of that are ok aren t they aw the carbon tax when it came in was supposed to be revenue neutral now we find it s just become a tax grab the ndp say don t worry we use the money we grab from you at the gas pump and your heating bill and we ll use it for cleanbc but it turns out only a small proportion of the money is going to this cleanbc thing we have no idea what difference it s going to make to daily life and so we have to wonder if they re really serious about this or if it s just greenwashing the ndp agenda tf they talk about energy efficient buildings and that includes phasing out natural gas for home heating it s ok to sell it to korea and china but not to use it here is that realistic aw b c has a major asset in high quality gas fields in the peace river country we have a very efficient existing pipeline system that works flawlessly and we have millions of clean burning furnaces and barbecues all over b c that people rely upon and enjoy if someone s going to tell them that individual homeowners have to spend thousands of dollars to convert their heating systems there had better be a good answer about who s going to pay for that tf the plan is to subsidize the purchase of electric heat pumps to replace natural gas furnaces aw this reminds me of a federal program in 2004 when my family spent 9 000 on a high efficiency furnace and got 1 500 back you ve got to have a lot of money sitting in your pocket to invest in these fancy programs and we have other opportunities to improve our carbon emissions in this province including in transportation b c is in a funny place because we have super clean electricity generation unlike most of the world and that means opportunities to reduce greenhouse gases have to focus on building transportation but you ve got to be careful about kicking the homeowner in the shins and telling them they ve got to convert their furnace a lot of them have already done it and it cost them a pile of money to do so tf the cleanbc plan also talks about running more transmission lines particularly in the northeast fort nelson is not on the b c hydro grid at all and that goes for that whole corner of the province i m looking for something in this you might support aw there will be more electrification of b c but it s got to be done in a way that works for consumers we re going to see more electric cars but that means you ve got to put in more power grid and more 240 volt charging stations including in people s homes that all costs a lot of money and so we re looking for a credible plan from the ndp to talk about how they re going to do this without breaking the bank of the taxpayer or the individual vehicle owner or homeowner and they seem to have forgotten that those three are the same person tf what s your priority for 2020 aw we re looking at a very exciting round of nomination races in b c we have a huge interest in people running for this party especially in ridings that are currently held by the ndp that used to be held by the b c liberals we ve opened up that
