takeaways us dollar denominated wealth is levered over 25 1 adding extraordinary amounts of liquidity to bank balance sheets recently confirms the fed understands the acute potential risks from another credit crisis de leveraging potentially accelerating monetary regime change the best reason sophisticated investors should explore crypto assets and blockchain businesses today is prudent portfolio diversification a decreasing percentage of investors use macroeconomics as an input to better understand financial asset values ignoring the broad view can be risky those that have given it some thought know that economies and markets have lost their cyclical nature because economic policymakers have figured out how to manage commercial and economic incentives using financial levers for every consequential occurrence or natural phase in an economic cycle that might otherwise negatively impact output growth inflation employment and financial asset prices there has been an equally powerful policy reaction such as interest rate cuts qe currency devaluations capital controls trade re negotiations and now not qe overnight and term repurchase agreements that are liquefying bank balance sheets and financial markets the most visible example of exogenous economic and financial management was the bail out following the financial crisis in 2008 which was in reality a successful bailout of the us dollar credit is simply a claim on currency and so systemic credit risk equals systemic currency risk could that happen again yes most investors do not appreciate that virtually all financial assets have become credit too regardless of their intrinsic value because intrinsic values are measured in the cash flow of the same credit based currency so both formal credit and financial assets are currency derivatives their values are only as good as the underlying currency which is managed by central banks and sovereign currency boards peak fiat there is about 100 trillion of usd denominated stocks bonds and m2 plus multi trillions more in real estate and other assets theoretically contracted to be monetized someday with us dollars there is only about 4 trillion in usd base money that ostensibly collateralizes it in short usd denominated capital i e wealth is levered at least 25 1 the graph below shows only usd denominated credit and does not include m2 equity non public market debt real estate etc which also have values ultimately dependent upon the leverage ratio of usd credit to usd base money against this backdrop the fed s not qe since last september is a very telling initiative given that there was no obvious existential threat to the economy or markets that might have triggered it other than the building sentiment that a global economic slowdown was in the cards for 2020 despite the the cleanest dirty shirt status of the usd it would face extreme dilution through acknowledged qe were there to be a global recession that could lead to losing its status as the world s only reserve currency the dollar is more than a currency to the united states government it is the primary tool policymakers use to manage global trade control shipping lanes and influence foreign policy its fall as the world s only reserve currency would lessen us government influence over the global economy not qe suggests that policymakers will not let economies take their natural course can this state of affairs prevail seems unlikely global central banks have already dropped interest rates to record low and negative yields assets are highly levered directly and indirectly and their values are full the us is already in its longest output expansion without a recession and the largest portion of wealth is held in an age cohort starting to reduce risk and shrink balance sheets fiat i e political monetary regimes usually last no longer than 60 years a new one seems inevitable modern monetary theory mmt is a concept that places government currency monopolies at the center of economies it proposes that governments use fiscal incentives to target output growth and employment the goal is to use money creation to achieve full employment when inflation occurs fiscal authorities would then raise taxes or issue new sovereign debt to mop up excess money in the system mmt has not yet been formally endorsed by sovereign authorities in capitalist economies however monetary policymakers seem to be adopting aspects of it already mmt won t work for the first time ever there is digital software that promises to provide the means for sovereigns like china to challenge the dollar s unilateral reserve currency status allow un banked peoples around the world to grow economies without ties to the usd allow savers everywhere to store and transfer value online using un levered currency and assets and allow investors with 100 exposure to dilute able fiat currencies and their financial asset derivatives to hedge their portfolios with global access to competitive currencies single or federated governments can no longer rely on their currency monopolies to direct domestic output employment or inflation and asset prices the almost 50 of americans living paycheck to paycheck should continue supporting and being proud of us dollars as long as they stay employed and there are no shortages of goods and services widening wealth and income gaps should not necessarily lead to a loss of faith in the dollar however it seems reasonable and not xenophobic to argue that if the us dollar and its credit and financial derivatives sneeze then the world would catch a pretty severe cold a global credit event whether or not economists anticipate or declare a formal recession opens the door for lost fiat market share economic policymakers that allow currencies to be levered beyond the point of being in the same valuation universe as asset values are effectively in the business of creating imbalances imbalances that separate the wages of owners and labor imbalances that separate access to goods and services and imbalances that can foment geographic hostilities the more exogenous managers synthesize stable global supply and demand through monetary fiscal and trade policies the greater these imbalances become imagine a world with one global wage and price scale to have one global currency users would have to trust one authority could it be open source software available to anyone in the world with an internet connection should anyone interested in storing wealth have 100 exposure to us dollars fiat currencies priced against them or their financial assets derivatives investing in financial asset abstractions for investors the only ways to generate a return on any currency is to lend it or speculate on its exchange rate vis à vis other currencies against this backdrop what is the intrinsic value of the us dollar the taxing authority of the us treasury currently about 2 5 trillion year and the ability of the fed to print as many usd as it wants so that all accounts can be settled what about the 200 other dirtier shirts around the world implicitly or explicitly pegged to dollars only in financial economies with 25 1 leverage would there be very little savings in non interest bearing assets a saver in usd or any other fiat currency has incentive to put accumulated wealth into market priced i e risk assets that may potentially overcome necessary future inflation heavy handed central bank policies following the 2008 financial crisis have driven financial asset prices higher as manifest through record low yielding sovereign debt tight credit spreads and high cap weighted equity indexes it is interesting to note that industrial commodity prices are not at record highs because they better reflect waning economic demand and 40 of s p 500 companies lost money in 2019 despite cap weighted indexes making new highs prices and real values of financial assets have parted ways prices reflecting short term credit driven liquidity real values not reflecting how much necessary dilution is baked into the assets underlying currencies most financial asset investors have also lessened their sponsorship of discretionary trading and investing as expressed through program trading volume in the equity markets 90 and the collapse of allocations to value investing most alpha seeking strategies and idiosyncratic investment opportunities fundamental analysis has become less important than the last price george soros notion of currency pricing being reflexive rising and falling exchange rates are most apt to continue beyond all fundamental metrics can now be applied to financial assets this makes sense given the argument above that financial assets are currency derivatives and that both are greatly levered with abstract intrinsic values beta returns through index exposure have become the only option that can accommodate market breadth and depth it has paid since 2009 for index exposure to be long only across liquidity driven markets the implication of staying long financial asset indexes today is that most investors believe central banks will continue to increase bank balance sheet liquidity at a rate that promotes risk on exposure and nominal rois that beat the risk free rate zero but also that the underlying currency will not be diluted more than the nominal roi being managed by central bank monetary policies market capture monetary regime change so central banks hold the key to financial asset returns which are essentially currency derivatives the primary mission of central banks is to oversee and protect the solvency of member banking institutions their secondary mission is their more public economic mandates effectively helping increase annual output growth with moderate inflation and full employment it is questionable whether a credit based economy could withstand deflation or extended periods of disinflation both would make debt repayment more difficult for households businesses and governments which in turn would threaten the solvency of banks that count loans as assets hyperinflation is triggered by money printing which is a choice of policymakers that beats the alternative it is done mechanically by central banks conjuring new base money and giving it to primary banks which would then distribute it in the form of consumer credit in 2009 the fed avoided high inflation let alone hyperinflation by initiating interest on excess reserves ioer in effect paying banks a risk free rate of interest on new base money sufficient to incentivize them not to lend it out it is an ironic malapropism to call the paltry collateral backing 25 1 leverage excess reserves banks are structured to thrive in periods of modest inflation and even brief periods of hyperinflation because their profitability and viability rely on interest rate spreads separating their assets loans and liabilities deposits deflation or extended periods of disinflation or hyperinflation would threaten the wherewithal of borrowers which in turn would threaten bank assets as a result central banks include inflation targets that diminish the purchasing power of savers in their currencies the traditional and widely accepted difference separating nominal from real gdp output growth less goods and service inflation i e consumer price inflation does not capture the affordability imbalances discussed above it seems likely these imbalances will eventually be manifest in other less obvious ways how many times have established institutions declared no one could have foreseen that event next time around the consequences should be that much more acute what if there is a widespread loss of confidence in us dollars technically the fed not have to make good on all usd denominated credit only the credit underwritten by their member banks total bank assets today in the us are not quite 18 trillion which means that the fed is obligated to print only about 14 trillion in base money for its banks 18 trillion 14 trillion in excess reserves the other 84 trillion plus of implicitly contracted usd credit would be theoretically left out in the cold banks would be protected but borrowers and non bank lenders would not nevertheless most of us would expect the fed and other central banks to produce however much base money is necessary to stabilize their currencies and economies via the oft feared helicopter drop their mission would be to re establish confidence in their currencies it is anyone s guess if this would succeed but either way the process of hyper inflating and distributing new currency to creditors and debtors would diminish the purchasing power of savers in both risk and non risk assets the point here is not to predict if when how why or what will trigger a loss of confidence in the current global monetary regime and its impact on today s un reserved fiat denominated wealth the point is to call attention to the almost complete store of wealth in currency derivatives the best reason to explore crypto assets and blockchain businesses today is prudent portfolio diversification paul brodsky

in offshore dollar lending increasingly through opaque security markets has exploded to 18 trillion and has overwhelmed the safety buffers of the existing financial architecture the concern is that a continued surge in the value of the us dollar potentially triggered by the coronavirus epidemic or any other black swan catalyst could bring this to a head the risk of an unexpected and unplanned reversal of abundant global liquidity hangs over the world economy strong contagion across markets could make the endogenous dynamics of global liquidity very dangerous the panel warned in an advisory report for g20 ministers the financial stability board and the imf a decade of ultra low interest rates and quantitative easing has flooded the globe with highly unstable forms of funding denominated in dollars with no guarantor standing behind them glaring currency and maturity mismatches have accumulated this structure is prone to an abrupt dollar crunch should borrowers in china east asia emerging markets or even parts of europe suddenly start scrambling for scarce us currency to repay bonds and loans in a crisis the report from the robert triffin international forum said the purely private component of global liquidity defined as foreign currency credit to non banks has mushroomed to 12 trillion this now dwarfs the shrunken 3 trillion pool of official liquidity such as imf resources central bank swap lines and even the eurozone bailout fund esm this private liquidity is highly geared to spasms of risk appetite and over confidence and even more geared to panic when trouble starts it can snap back violently and set off potentially unstoppable chain reactions in a heartbeat the liquidity is destroyed by forced deleveraging staircase up escalator down as the 2008 experience shows the supply of private liquidity cannot be relied upon in periods of stress according to the document by bernard snoy andre icard and philip turner former top officials at the world bank and the bank for international settlements they warned that there is no clear backstop if anything goes wrong this is the achilles heel in the structure of globalised modern finance the torment of regulators at their swiss sanctum sanctorum in basel the imf cannot plausibly come to the rescue in a major upset its resources have dwindled to just 1 percent of global external liabilities down from 4 percent in the 1980s overtaken by the mushrooming scale of cross border finance the imf is not in a position to function as an international lender of last resort the global financial safety net is too small they said this is ominous since the so called balance of payments disequilibria has become completely unhinged global imbalances have now reached 40 percent of world gdp an historical peak and four times larger than in the 1990s they write only the us federal reserve can print dollars and act as the guarantor of a deformed monetary regime at the mercy of dollar supremacy or what the bank for international settlements calls the global dollar system other central banks rely on currency swap lines from the fed to shore up their own financial systems in an emergency it took some 600 billion of fed swap lines to halt contagion during the lehman crisis in 2008 when the wholesale capital markets froze and offshore dollar funding vanished in other words the fed rescued the european central bank and saved the euro from an impending cataclysm though to this day few eu politicians understand what really happened however fed support while in principle still available ultimately requires the political assent of the u s treasury and congress in washington s current america first mood these so called fx lines are seen by many on capitol hill and perhaps in the oval office as bailing out foreigners there may be critical blockages or delays in a fast moving crisis allowing a lehmanesque event to spin out of control the imf has issued just a warning furthermore key fed figures from the lehman drama including tim geithner and ben bernanke warn that post crisis legislation such as the dodd frank act prevent the fed from repeating such a rescue in extremis specifically new rules limit emergency help for foreign entities the core global problem is the disturbing level of dependence on fickle dollar flows and shadow funding outside u s jurisdiction the dollar s role has actually grown this century despite europe s monetary union and the rise of china neither the euro nor the yuan have made a dent on dollar hegemony where it matters banks outside the united states currently have dollar debts which exceed the total liabilities of banks operating within the united states their dollar funding is vulnerable to any dollar liquidity shock said the triffin report under the imf s measure the volume has reached 18 trillion including swaps the bis has a different gauge but the message is the same dollar credit to non banks outside the u s has risen to 14 percent of global gdp from 10 percent at the top of the financial bubble in 2007 the sharp rise in this ratio was seen as very dangerous even then said the report this unstable regime is tested whenever the dollar strengthens either because the u s economy is powering ahead faster than other big oecd economies usually benign or more treacherously when fear triggers a flight to dollar safety u s treasury bonds are the ultimate refuge other than niche plays like the swiss franc and the yen there are hints of this nervousness now as china s coronavirus leads to supply chain disruptions for global manufacturing and as the eurozone s fragile recovery keeps disappointing the dollar index dxy has spiked over the last five weeks to 98 70 and is nearing a 30 month peak the fed s broad dollar index is even higher today than at the top of the dotcom dollar bubble in 2002 this dollar squeeze tightens conditions for corporate borrowers in emerging markets often over leveraged with short term debt that must be repaid or rolled over these debtors include chinese developers with big dollar liabilities contracted on the hong kong funding markets but with no dollar revenues to act as a hedge they are now being hit by a double whammy a depreciating yuan and a financial shock within china from the virus lockdown while banks have stepped back since the lehman crisis under draconian regulations and higher capital ratios the risks have migrated to the offshore bond markets and opaque capital flows huge sums are being channeled through exchange traded funds and other instruments that promise investors liquid withdrawal at any time while locking the money into illiquid assets a business model built on a lie in the words of mark carney the outgoing governor of the bank of england bond funds have made investors complacent about liquidity risks they buy illiquid and high yielding paper but quote daily prices to provide liquidity assurance liquidity illusion to investors

the end of the global economy the trump administration has just granted its commerce department sweeping powers to slap tariffs on countries it decides are manipulating their currencies to the detriment of the united states and its exporting companies for some this will come as news at aoth it is confirmation that our earlier warning reported here has come true in our article us prepares for currency war we warned readers about these new powers when they were first proposed by the us government several months ago amid its trade war with china the commerce department now says it will proceed with the plan which gives commerce a wide scope of power to decide whether or not a country is under cutting us exporters by keeping its currency artificially low whereas commerce normally follows the advice of the treasury department which issues a twice yearly report to congress on suspected currency manipulators on whether to impose trade sanctions the new rules allow commerce to slap duties on goods from accused countries and individual businesses even in cases where the treasury did not find them to be guilty of currency manipulation bloomberg neatly explains what broadening the commerce department s mandate to impose anti subsidy duties could mean the new rule which was opposed by the treasury department when it was first proposed in may 2019 would allow u s companies to file complaints with the commerce department over specific imported products by treating undervalued currencies as a form of unfair subsidy it would also give the administration the power to self initiate cases should it so choose however potentially making the u s government plaintiff judge jury and executioner in currency fights some industries and us at aoth believe this aggressively protectionist stance will lead to currency wars and turn the 6 trillion per day global currency market into a new battleground for trump s trade wars goods benefiting from weak currencies representing each and every one of america s trading partners could be recipients of duties or countervailing duties equal to the difference between the weaker currency and the us dollar in other words eliminating that country s currency advantage here s how it could work a us company that manufactures and sells widgets is losing market share to chinese companies that makes their widgets cheaper and sells them in the us at a significant discount to us widgets the us companies through an industry association lobby the us government to help them stop china from dumping widgets on the us market the industry association says that china s undervalued currency is an unfair subsidy the commerce department investigates president trump imposes a tariff on chinese widgets to level the playing field for american widget makers trump s claim that his tariffs on chinese goods are being absorbed by the chinese government is incorrect in this situation the us consumer pays the inflated price the tariff on a chinese widget and the tariff percentage goes to the us government the real loser is the us consumer or end user who is forced to buy more expensive american widgets while china is the obvious target of us tariffs and rule changes strengthening the commerce department s hand in dealing with currency complaints there are many other countries and individual businesses commerce has in its sights last year the treasury department came out with a report that recommended 21 trading partners should face scrutiny over their currencies they include china germany japan south korea ireland italy malaysia vietnam and singapore these trading nations and even their indivivual businesses that import goods into the us are now vulnerable to being tariffed on targeted imports an amount that will make imports sell for more than their us counterpart the big question is why the official reason given by secretary of commerce wilbur ross is as follows this currency rule is an important step in ensuring that unfair trade practices are properly remedied ross said in a statement while successive administrations have balked at countervailing foreign currency subsidies the trump administration is taking action to level the playing field for american businesses and workers weaponizing the dollar but the most important reason for such drastic protectionism not seen in the united states since the great depression is to lower the us dollar previous attempts by trump to talk down the dollar through pressing fed chair jerome powell to lower interest rates and demonizing him for not doing so have largely failed the us dollar index dxy has not dropped below 95 in the past year many trade and forex observers believe the currency rule is another step in trump s efforts to weaponize the dollar for trump a low dollar is the way to bring jobs back to the us after so many were exported abroad to take advantage of lower labor costs and therefore rebuild the us manufacturing sector primarily through cheaper exports the problem for the united states is that throughout the past several years the dollar has remained high in relation to other currencies the dollar as the world s reserve currency can only go so low because it will always be in high demand for countries to purchase commodities priced in us dollars and us treasuries nor should it be allowed to go too low because that would risk the dollar losing its exorbitant privilege us exporters face resistance from foreign buyers because products priced in dollars are more expensive bloomberg quotes mark sobel a former treasury official this is a unilateral policy which will alienate countries around the world he added the highly unusual trading stance may even put the us at odds with its world trade organization commitments opening the country up to wto challenges conclusion but there s more to it than that taken to its logical solution if the us starts slapping tariffs on all the products its domestic industries can t compete against we are looking at the complete collapse of global trade as we know it imagine you want to hell you need to sell your products to the us because of the enormity of the us market consumer spending makes up 70 of us gdp to be a successful international company you need to be selling into the us but your american competitors don t like how cheaply you re able to sell your goods in their own backyard they complain to the commerce department and bang you re your us imports are immediately hit with a 25 tariff guess what just happened to your us market any country in the world that manufactures goods that are priced higher than ones made in the us or any country company that manufactures goods the commerce department thinks can be made cheaper domestically can be subjected to punishing duties those duties aren t picked up by the so called currency manipulators they are added to the prices paid by us consumers and go directly into us government coffers and because a lot of goods previously made in america no longer are because of globalization american consumers end up paying billions of dollars worth of duties which are effectively an import tax on consumers having treated its former trading partners with such disdain they of course begin looking elsewhere to replace the increasingly closed off us market in country supply chains spring up regional trading blocks with countries friendly enough to not engage in a race to the bottom devaluation battle start to emerge including the countries that are part of china s belt and road initiative the problem though is everything is priced in us dollars companies don t have to sell into the us but they do have to buy raw materials which invariably are priced in usd soon discussions at higher levels like the imf and the wto point to alternatives beyond the usd the us has been in danger of losing its exorbitant privilege but now its adversarial trade stance pushes the major powers into adopting a new global currency possibly backed by gold once this happens the us dollar plunges in value hardly anyone can afford to trade with the us because of its radical protectionism in this environment of fear and isolationism the metals that prosper are gold and silver traditional safe havens that hold their value and can be relied upon as tangible currencies in the event of a fiat money breakdown the united states withdraws further and further from its former trading partners eventually the only countries it trades with are its old nafta stalwarts canada and mexico coffee beans from kenya chinese silks forget about it most imported products are either too expensive or not available the irony in all this is how badly the us would hurt itself bereft of trading partners the once mighty us economy becomes a shadow of its former self as for commodities the new america is in real trouble having relied on offshore suppliers for decades the us mining industry cannot produce enough critical metals to feed the industries factories needed to replace imports raw materials are in short supply to fix america s crumbling infrastructure the us mining industry embraces the opportunity to explore for and mine these metals but it takes 10 to 15 years to build new mines and that s after large deposit discoveries are made it doesn t help that for many years the united states government couldn t agree on a viable mining strategy with anti mining democrats pitted against nimby republican lawmakers who preferred to share mining knowledge with countries locked into chinese off take agreements rather than nurture a domestic mining industry that could come to the rescue of the us which has cut itself adrift are we being alarmist maybe at aoth we believe the global economy has reached an inflection point that is very close to breaking down global growth has slowed compounded by trade wars the slowdown in china and the latest threat the novel coronavirus according to the world gold council global gold backed etfs and similar products added 61 tonnes t or net inflows of us 3 1bn in january across nearly all regions boosting holdings to new all time highs of 2 947t central banks worried about economies cooling and low inflation were buying gold by the truckload and pursuing monetary stimulus in the form of interest rate cuts and or massive bond buying programs like we went through with quantitative easing in the us europe and japan that worked pretty well after the financial crisis when the world economy was more or less back on track with no tit for tat tariffs impeding international trade and the us dollar still carrying enough heft and respect to enjoy exorbitant privilege this time is different we have an unpredictable president in the white house that has already done much damage to the world economy hurt the relationship between the us and china and now appears heading towards a global currency trade war wherein everybody dukes it out over who can devalue and out export the other the outcome is a gradual race to worthless and america s trading partners punting the dollar and replacing it with a basket of currencies likely remember all that central bank gold buying backed by gold the trump administration is going down a very dangerous road with its new currency rule that imbues the us commerce department with incredibly strong powers to invoke across the board trade protectionism from countries all the way down to individual companies the way we see it buying gold or silver bullion is one of the best ways to take a defensive position during what

like many lebanese jesuit priest gabriel khairallah has been on the front lines of anti government protests for more than three months i mean what am i doing on the front i am against corruption and seeking social justice and the same for the doctors he says he s done much more than protest on the streets in recent weeks he also opened a low cost medical clinic in the annex of beirut s st joseph church in khairallah s clinic which is run mostly by volunteers the cost of a visit is about 5 and is waived for those who can t afford it more than 30 doctors serve on a rotating basis providing specialized care in cardiology pediatrics gynecology and orthopedics khairallah also corralled pharmacies to donate certain medicines we are collecting from every person of goodwill says khairallah we are not expecting a miracle we hope to create a place where people feel respected a perfect economic storm the need for such a clinic arose as lebanon s economic woes sparked spontaneous mass protests last october a million people took to the streets initially anger surged over a new tax on internet voice call services and expanded to demand the ouster of the government the protests peaceful for months grew more violent in december as riot police used water cannons tear gas and rubber bullets to stop thousands from demonstrating in front of the parliament building lebanon is one of the most indebted nations in the world for decades the central bank serviced debt by offering high interest rates to attract capital but it reached a point that people began to realize it s not sustainable and the government is just accumulating more debt and the banks are further away from solvency says paul salem president of the middle east institute in washington d c over the past 18 months with a decline in oil prices remittances from lebanese working in the gulf also have shrunk it s causing a reverse sucking motion salem says with people not sending money and trying to pull their money out lebanon s worsening economic crisis has had dire consequences for the country s medical care doctors have staged sit ins at hospitals to warn of shortages of lifesaving medicines and supplies which can no longer be obtained from international suppliers due to a shortage of u s dollars patients began skipping doctor visits vaccinations and prescriptions because they could no longer afford them as insurance policies lapsed amid widespread unemployment more and more people are not able to pay the fees doctor fees khairallah says as the protest movement gained strength in october lebanese banks closed for two weeks when the banks reopened they restricted lines of credit and the central bank began to limit u s dollar withdrawals the first to suffer were businesses requiring hard currency including medical suppliers which could only access 50 of the dollars needed to purchase goods the lebanese government also failed to reimburse private and public hospitals for medical care to patients covered by social security and military health accounts according to human rights watch the world is collapsing on top of everyone khairallah s new clinic has quickly become a lifeline for patients who crowd into a small waiting room i was in the middle class before says a middle aged woman who would not give her name chagrined by showing up at a free clinic she had been forgoing medical appointments until this clinic opened she recently lost her job at a university now she struggles she curses lebanon s political elite for stealing the country people who have money can t withdraw it the world is collapsing on top of everyone she says referring to currency controls that limit lebanese bank withdrawals atms no longer dispense dollars and depositors must wait in long lines to withdraw small sums each week on jan 25 the 100th day of anti government protests khairallah was back on the streets weaving his way through thousands of people waving lebanese flags and chanting slogans against the government to show the power that we are here and we are not afraid he was joined by dr mouin jammal an internal medicine specialist the head doctor for khairallah s new clinic we still have to make more pressure that s why we are here says jammal he wants the central bank to raise the dollar limits for medical supplies before hospitals run out we will not wait until it s really empty he says about the dwindling hospital stocks this is why we are making pressure to avoid the crisis bloated bureaucracy the fix for lebanon s health care crisis will require reforming the country s bloated and inefficient bureaucracy say doctors who have worked in lebanon s system for years the ministry of health is a corrupt ministry completely says dr karam karam a clinical professor of medicine at the american university of beirut who served as health minister in the 1990s while in office karam says he introduced a transparent bidding process to combat bribery on purchases of medicine and medical supplies from abroad we saved almost 50 million he says in just one year and cut kickbacks by the same amount do you think anyone says thank you since then corruption in the health ministry has escalated says dr ismail sukkarieh a gastroenterologist and member of parliament in the 1990s everything is on the basis of financial calculations the mentality of business not the mentality of responsibility he says there are already critical shortages of medicine hospitals have stopped performing nonessential surgeries and closed entire wings for lack of patients economist nisreen salti an associate professor at the american university of beirut who studies the health sector believes it is unlikely there will be a complete breakdown in the health care system but believes the availability of expensive and critical life saving medicines including cancer drugs will decline except to the privileged a shrinking pool of people covered by what is available lebanon was once proud of its health care sector despite the corruption but things are different now she says even if these acts of cleaning up take place we always revert back to a state where things lack transparency again and drug prices seem to be artificially high salti says she warns the lebanese will be less healthy because of rising unemployment and diminished resources for housing and food which are linked with health i fear that the deep erosion is one that is difficult to recover from and to correct she says we cannot rely on donors dr elie saliba a pediatric orthopedic surgeon also worries about long term erosion as he gives a visitor a tour of a special center for children with cerebral palsy in the sprawling hospital of bhannes hospitality center for charity sisters compound in bikfaya an hour s drive from beirut saliba splits his practice at night he provides free medical care for anti government protesters injured by security police and by day he sees his usual patients and is on call at the children s center there are 80 children in a space filled with brightly colored exercise equipment for daily therapies and classrooms that accommodate child sized wheelchairs the cost for residential care is more than 1 000 per month he says the government has paid 400 of that amount for each patient he says but no longer does due to the economic crisis the rest of the the center s budget comes from private donors he says but we cannot rely on donors in this period many of the richest lebanese the facility s traditional benefactors have left the country and no longer make charitable donations and those of more modest means now have even less to give the upshot saliba says we may close at the end of the year

while u s advocates and local politicians struggle to get their first public banks chartered mexico s new president has begun construction on 2 700 branches of a government owned bank to be completed in 2021 when it will be the largest bank in the country at a press conference on january 6 he said the neoliberal model had failed private banks were not serving the poor and people outside the cities so the government had to step in andrés manuel lópez obrador known as amlo has been compared to the united kingdom s left wing opposition leader jeremy corbyn with one notable difference amlo is now in power he and his left wing coalition won by a landslide in mexico s 2018 general election overturning the institutional revolutionary party pri that had ruled the country for much of the past century called mexico s first full fledged left wing experiment amlo s election marks a dramatic change in the political direction of the country amlo wrote in his 2018 book a new hope for mexico in mexico the governing class constitutes a gang of plunderers mexico will not grow strong if our public institutions remain at the service of the wealthy elites the new president has held to his campaign promises in 2019 his first year in office he did what donald trump pledged to do drain the swamp purging the government of technocrats and institutions he considered corrupt profligate or impeding the transformation of mexico after 36 years of failed market focused neoliberal policies other accomplishments have included substantially increasing the minimum wage while cutting top government salaries and oversize pensions making small loans and grants directly to farmers guaranteeing crop prices for key agricultural crops launching programs to benefit youth the disabled and the elderly and initiating a 44 billion infrastructure plan lópez obrador s goal he says is to construct a new paradigm in economic policy that improves human welfare not just increases gross domestic product the end of the neoliberal era to deliver on that promise in july 2019 amlo converted the publicly owned federal savings bank bansefi into a bank of the poor banco del bienestar or welfare bank he said on january 6 that the neoliberal era had eliminated all the state owned banks but one which he had gotten approval to expand with 2 700 new branches added to the existing 538 branches of the former bansefi that will bring the total in two years to 3 238 branches far outstripping any other bank in the country banco azteca currently the largest by number of branches has 1 860 digital banking will also be developed speaking to a local group in december amlo said his goal was for the bank of the poor to reach 13 000 branches more than all the private banks in the country combined at a news conference on january 8 he explained why this new bank was needed there are more than 1 000 municipalities that don t have a bank branch we re dispersing resources but we don t have a way to do it people have to go to branches that are two three hours away if we don t bring these services close to the people we re not going to bring development to the people they re already building i ll invite you within two months three at the most to the inauguration of the first branches because they re already working they re getting the land because we have to do it quickly the president said the 10 billion pesos 530 4 million needed to build the new branches would come from government savings and that 5 million had already been transferred to the banco del bienestar which would pass the funds to the secretariat of defense whose engineers were responsible for construction the military will also be used to transport physical funds to the branches for welfare payments amlo added they are helping me they are propping me up the military has behaved very well and they don t back down at all they always tell me yes you can yes we do go to concerns that the government owned bank would draw deposits away from commercial banks and might compete in other ways such as making interest free loans to small businesses amlo countered there s no reason to be complaining about us building these branches f private banks want to build branches they have every right to go to the towns and build their branches but as they won t because they believe that it s not business we have to do it it s our social responsibility the state can t shirk its social responsibility issues with the central bank while the legislature has approved the new bank mexico s central bank can still block it if bank regulations are breached ricardo delfín who works at the international accounting firm kpmg told the newspaper la razón that if the money to fund the bank comes from a loan from the federal government rather than from capital it will adversely affect the bank s capitalization ratio but amlo contends that the bank will be self sufficient funding for construction will come from federal savings from other programs and the bank s operating expenses will be covered by small commissions paid on each transaction by customers most of whom are welfare recipients branches will be built on land owned by the government or donated and software companies have offered to advise for free about the central bank he said we re going to speak with those from the bank of méxico respecting the autonomy of the bank of méxico we have to educate them because for them this is an anachronism even sacrilege because they have other ideas but we ve arrived here after telling the people that the neoliberal economic policy was going to change there shouldn t be obstacles how is the bank of méxico going to stop us from having a branch that disperses resources in favor of the people what damage does that do whom does it harm amlo has repeatedly promised not to interfere in the business of the central bank which has been autonomous for the past quarter of a century but he has also said that he would like its mandate expanded from just preserving the value of the peso by fighting inflation to include fostering growth the concern according to the financial times is that he might use the central bank to fund government programs following in the footsteps of argentina s former president cristina fernández de kirchner whose heterodox policies led to high inflation and many economists believe the country s current crisis mark weisbrot counters in the new york times that argentina s problems were caused not by printing money to fund domestic development but by a massive foreign debt hyperinflation actually happened under fernández de kirchner s successor president mauricio macri who replaced her in 2015 the public debt grew from 53 to more than 86 of gdp inflation soared from 18 to 54 short term interest rates shot up to 75 and poverty increased from 27 to 40 in an upset election in august 2019 the outraged argentinian public re elected fernández de kirchner as vice president and her former head of the cabinet of ministers as president restoring the 12 year kirchner legacy begun by her husband nestor kirchner in 2003 and considered by weisbrot to be among the most successful presidencies in the western hemisphere more appropriate than argentina as a model for what can be achieved by a government working in partnership with its central bank is that of japan where prime minister shinzo abe has funded his stimulus programs by selling government bonds directly to the bank of japan the boj now holds nearly 50 of the government s debt yet consumer price inflation remains low so low that the boj cannot get the figure up even to its 2 target other funding options amlo is unlikely to go that route because he has vowed not to interfere with the central bank but analysts say he needs to introduce some sort of economic stimulus because mexico s gdp has slipped in the last year the mexican president has criticized gdp as the ultimate standard advocating instead for a model of development that incorporates wealth distribution and access to education health housing and culture into its measurements but as kurt hackbarth warned in jacobin in december to fully unfurl program without simply ransacking other line items to pay for it will require doing something amlo has up to now categorically ruled out raising taxes on the rich and large corporations which not surprisingly make out like utter bandits in mexico s rigged financial system amlo has continually vowed however not to raise taxes on the rich instead he has enlisted mexico s business magnates as investors in public private partnerships allowing him to avoid the tequila trap that brought down argentina and mexico itself in earlier years getting locked into debt to foreign investors and the international monetary fund mexico s business leaders seem happy to invest in the country despite some slippage in gdp as noted by carlos slim mexico s wealthiest man debt didn t go up there is no fiscal deficit and inflation came down in november 2019 the economy secretariat reported that foreign direct investment showed a 7 8 increase in the first nine months of that year compared with the same period in 2018 reaching its second highest level ever and at the end of 2019 the peso was up around 4 stocks also rose 4 5 and inflation dropped from 4 8 to 3 partnering with local business leaders is politically expedient but public private partnerships can be expensive and as u k professor richard werner points out tapping up private investors merely recirculates existing money in the economy better would be to borrow directly from banks which create new bank money when they lend as the bank of england has confirmed this new money then circulates in the economy stimulating productivity today the best model for that approach is china which funds infrastructure by borrowing from its own state owned banks like all banks they create loans as bank credit on their books which is then repaid with the proceeds of the projects created with the loans there is no need to tap up the central bank or rich investors or the tax base government banks can create money on their books just as central banks and private banks do for mexico however using its public banks as china does would be something for the future if at all meanwhile amlo has been a trailblazer in showing how a national public banking system can be initiated quickly and efficiently the key it seems is just to have the political will along with massive support from the public the legislature local business leaders and the military this article was first posted on truthdig com

digital banking will also be developed speaking to a local group in december amlo said his goal was for the bank of the poor to reach 13 000 branches more than all the private banks in the country combined at a news conference on jan 8 he explained why this new bank was needed there are more than 1 000 municipalities that don t have a bank branch we re dispersing resources but we don t have a way to do it people have to go to branches that are two three hours away if we don t bring these services close to the people we re not going to bring development to the people they re already building i ll invite you within two months three at the most to the inauguration of the first branches because they re already working they re getting the land because we have to do it quickly the president said the 10 billion pesos 530 4 million needed to build the new branches would come from government savings and that 5 million had already been transferred to the banco del bienestar which would pass the funds to the secretariat of defense whose engineers were responsible for construction the military will also be used to transport physical funds to the branches for welfare payments amloadded they are helping me they are propping me up the military has behaved very well and they don t back down at all they always tell me yes you can yes we do go to concerns that the government owned bank would draw deposits away from commercial banks and might compete in other ways such as making interest free loans to small businesses amlo countered there s no reason to be complaining about us building these branches f private banks want to build branches they have every right to go to the towns and build their branches but as they won t because they believe that it s not business we have to do it it s our social responsibility the state can t shirk its social responsibility issues with the central bank while the legislature has approved the new bank mexico s central bank can still block it if bank regulations are breached ricardo delfín who works at the international accounting firm kpmg told the newspaper la razón that if the money to fund the bank comes from a loan from the federal government rather than from capital it will adversely affect the bank s capitalization ratio but amlo contends that the bank will be self sufficient funding for construction will come from federal savings from other programs and the bank s operating expenses will be covered by small commissions paid on each transaction by customers most of whom are welfare recipients branches will be built on land owned by the government or donated and software companies have offered to advise for free about the central bank he said we re going to speak with those from the bank of méxico respecting the autonomy of the bank of méxico we have to educate them because for them this is an anachronism even sacrilege because they have other ideas but we ve arrived here after telling the people that the neoliberal economic policy was going to change there shouldn t be obstacles how is the bank of méxico going to stop us from having a branch that disperses resources in favor of the people what damage does that do whom does it harm amlo has repeatedly promised not to interfere in the business of the central bank which has been autonomous for the past quarter of a century but he has also said that he would like its mandate expanded from just preserving the value of the peso by fighting inflation to include fostering growth the concern according to the financial times is that he might use the central bank to fund government programs following in the footsteps of argentina s former president cristina fernández de kirchner whose heterodox policies led to high inflation and many economists believe the country s current crisis mark weisbrot counters in the new york times however that argentina s problems were caused not by printing money to fund domestic development but by a massive foreign debt hyperinflation actually happened under fernández de kirchner s successor president mauricio macri who replaced her in 2015 the public debt grew from 53 to more than 86 of gdp inflation soared from 18 to 54 short term interest rates shot up to 75 and poverty increased from 27 to 40 in an upset election in august 2019 the outraged argentinian public re elected fernández de kirchner as vice president and her former head of the cabinet of ministers as president restoring the 12 year kirchner legacy begun by her husband nestor kirchner in 2003 and considered by weisbrot to be among the most successful presidencies in the western hemisphere more appropriate than argentina as a model for what can be achieved by a government working in partnership with its central bank is that of japan where prime minister shinzo abe has funded his stimulus programs by selling government bonds directly to the bank of japan the boj now holds nearly 50 of the government s debt yet consumer price inflation remains low so low that the boj cannot get the figure up even to its 2 target other funding options amlo is unlikely to go that route because he has vowed not to interfere with the central bank but analysts say he needs to introduce some sort of economic stimulus because mexico s gdp has slipped in the last year the mexican president has criticized gdp as the ultimate standard advocating instead for a model of development that incorporates wealth distribution and access to education health housing and culture into its measurements but as kurt hackbarth warned in jacobin in december to fully unfurl program without simply ransacking other line items to pay for it will require doing something amlo has up to now categorically ruled out raising taxes on the rich and large corporations which not surprisingly make out like utter bandits in mexico s rigged financial system amlo has continually vowed however not to raise taxes on the rich instead he has enlisted mexico s business magnates as investors in public private partnerships allowing him to avoid the tequila trap that brought down argentina and mexico itself in earlier years getting locked into debt to foreign investors and the international monetary fund mexico s business leaders seem happy to invest in the country despite some slippage in gdp as noted by carlos slim mexico s wealthiest man debt didn t go up there is no fiscal deficit and inflation came down in november 2019 the economy secretariat reported that foreign direct investment showed a 7 8 increase in the first nine months of that year compared with the same period in 2018 reaching its second highest level ever and at the end of 2019 the peso was up around 4 stocks also rose 4 5 and inflation dropped from 4 8 to 3 partnering with local businessleaders is politically expedient but public private partnerships can be expensive and as u k professor richard werner points out tapping up private investors merely recirculates existing money in the economy better would be to borrow directly from banks which create new bank money when they lend as the bank of england has confirmed this new money then circulates in the economy stimulating productivity today the best model for that approach is china which funds infrastructure by borrowing from its own state owned banks like all banks they create loans as bank credit on their books which is then repaid with the proceeds of the projects created with the loans there is no need to tap up the central bank or rich investors or the tax base government banks can create money on their books just as central banks and private banks do for mexico however using its public banks as china does would be something for the future if at all meanwhile amlo has been a trailblazer in showing how a national public banking system can be initiated quickly and efficiently the key it seems is just to have the political will along with massive support from the public the legislature local business leaders and the military

for years the ministry of health is a corrupt ministry completely says dr karam karam a clinical professor of medicine at the american university of beirut who served as health minister in the 1990s while in office karam says he introduced a transparent bidding process to combat bribery on purchases of medicine and medical supplies from abroad we saved almost 50 million he says in just one year and cut kickbacks by the same amount do you think anyone says thank you since then corruption in the health ministry has escalated says dr ismail sukkarieh a gastroenterologist and member of

if argentina needs divine intervention to resolve its latest debt crisis economy minister martin guzman went to the right man pope francis took the unusual role of a mediator in debt talks between guzman and international monetary fund chief kristalina georgieva on the sidelines of a vatican conference last week debt should not be paid at the price of unbearable sacrifices francis said in a nod to the gruelling negotiations his native argentina now faces with the imf and bondholders its creditors will not take such a forgiving stance argentina has thrown down the gauntlet to the imf and a group of creditors including gmo and t rowe price by demanding that a debt restructuring is completed by a tough march 31 deadline the south american nation is running out of money and is once again threatened by the spectre of default there is a significant probability of a hard default where argentina will miss payments says carl ross a partner and sovereign credit analyst at gmo the reason is this timeline is a very aggressive timeline it is an extremely compressed timeline relative to other debt restructuring in the last 20 years it is the city the pope hails from that has roiled creditors in recent weeks the province of buenos aires clashed with bondholders over a 250m payment but eventually gave in markets saw the lack of help from the government as a hardline stance that could be replicated in upcoming talks over the sovereign debt
why do economies take so long to recover from a financial crisis what role do financial markets play in the macroeconomy and how should monetary policy responses account for them will private contracts that specify payment in alternative crypto currencies survive without government regulation many of these questions are as central to the macroeconomic debate as they are ageless time and again policymakers economists and ordinary citizens have struggled with these issues occasionally forging new paths but more often just overlooking the lessons of bygone eras only to discover them anew and few episodes in our history contain as many lessons for macroeconomists as the great depression the abrogation of gold clauses on 18 february 1935 the united states supreme court issued one of its most controversial ever decision on economic matters by a slim five to four majority the court effectively invalidated the so called gold clauses on debt contracts the decision represented a watershed in the power of us congress to regulate money and monetary policy its background was fittingly dramatic the stakes enormous in 1933 the new roosevelt administration seeking to stimulate an economy in the midst of its worst crisis in the 20th century abandoned the gold standard setting the stage for a massive devaluation of the dollar and a rapid increase in commodity prices over the next few years hausman et al 2017 a forgotten yet key component of this programme was the joint resolution of congress on 5 june 1933 a dramatic legal development that invalidated the gold clauses in public as well as private debt contracts prior to 1933 many bond issues had clauses that allowed for repayment in gold as well as paper these contractual agreements known as gold clauses became popular in the aftermath of the civil war when a dual monetary system emerged and gold began to trade at a premium to paper money although this premium disappeared by 1879 and congress removed the last ties to silver in 1900 the use of gold clauses in private debt contracts was still widespread in 1933 abrogation instantly created the prospect of a massive redistribution of wealth a series of lawsuits ensued with four eventually reaching the supreme court nevertheless with the dollar down by nearly 70 by early 1935 enforcing existing gold clauses would have threatened many corporate bond issuers with bankruptcy in a complex and very confused ruling the supreme court determined that congress s action although deemed invalid could nevertheless be maintained because of the lack of actual damages to the plaintiff hart jr 1935 for all practical purposes gold clauses were henceforth nullified 1 the essence of the ruling hinged on the power of congress to regulate the currency and the monetary system with the court ultimately agreeing with the government s argument that its power in these matters must be absolute the ability of private citizens to settle contracts in gold was adjudged to pose an imminent threat to this authority the echo of this decision to the current debate surrounding the widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies and smart contracts is bound to be considerable the economic implications of the abrogation devaluation and the uncertainty surrounding the court s decision on abrogation had profound economic implications while aggregate gdp recovered and grew by 11 and 9 in 1933 and 1934 respectively private investment nevertheless fell and now stood a staggering 72 below its pre 1929 trend levels cole and ohanian 2004 in a recent paper gomes et al 2019 we show that the legal uncertainty surrounding the elimination of the gold clauses accounted for most of this disparity using hand collected historical data from the balance sheets income statements and bond characteristics of all publicly traded industrial us firms between 1930 and 1936 we are able to perform a detailed comparison of the behaviour of corporate investment across firms with varying levels of exposure to gold clauses in their debt contracts we find that the existence of gold denominated debt led to a significant reduction in investment over 1933 and 1934 this effect of gold clause exposure on investment is then dramatically reversed following the supreme court s decision to uphold abrogation any differences in corporate investment across firms have largely disappeared by the end of 1936 we calculate that about one third of the drop in the aggregate investment of public firms over 1933 1934 is explained by these events by 1936 nearly all of the now positive net investment is accounted for by the elimination of these leverage risks to corporate balance sheets as anticipated by existing theories of debt overhang firms exposed to leverage risk chose to instead increase their equity payout during 1933 and 1934 again reversing this behaviour following the supreme court s decision as the likelihood of default increased equity holders had an incentive to expropriate bondholders by increasing equity payout we observe the same patterns for small and large firms although the latter with their ample cash holdings were largely insulated from the distress of the financial intermediation sector bernanke 1983 calomiris and mason 2003 modern relevance our findings strongly suggest that the massive contraction in corporate investment was not due to a lack of funding or limited access to capital markets these factors played a role no doubt but the dramatic increase in debt burdens and the downward rigidity of debt contracts seem to have created serious agency problems that significantly undermined the economic recovery economists often emphasise the role of nominal rigidities in prices and wages but history suggests the long lived nature of nominal debt contracts have the potential to create far more serious disruptions to the economy 2 policymakers should take note today gold clauses are no longer common in bond contracts but the risk we identify remains especially relevant for many emerging economies where corporations issue bonds denominated in foreign currencies often the us dollar the possibility of a local currency depreciation exposes these emerging market issuers to leverage risk much like gold clauses exposed us issuers to the dollar s devaluation in the 1930s 3 and the challenges faced then would no doubt

first a review of last week s events eur usd the statistics in the united states including ism and nfp look rather optimistic the us indices have updated their record levels over the past five days the dow jones is 29393 and the s p500 is 3345 production orders in germany have been falling by 0 5 for three months in a row confirming concerns about the state of the european economy which is teetering on the edge of recession as a result expectations are growing among investors regarding the expansion of quantitative easing qe policy in the euro zone and confidence is growing that the dollar rate will remain at least unchanged this has recently been stated by the fed vice president randal quarles donald trump also radiates optimism ahead of the presidential election insistently reminding the voters that the unemployment in the us is at a record low of 3 5 recall that the opinion of experts as well as most indicators on d1 regarding the pair s quotes on the last five day period was neutral gray 50 50 first of all because of the unclear situation with the coronavirus but at the same time on both timeframes h4 and d1 about 15 of the oscillators gave signals the pair was overbought and the trend reversal down was upcoming graphical analysis on h4 agrees with this development foreshadowing a return to a very strong support of 1 0990 1 1000 this is exactly what happened the pair did turn around and reached the specified support on wednesday february 05 this was followed by a 20 hour battle of the bulls and the bears which in the end ended with the victory of the latter the dollar continued to rise while the euro continued to fall the decline in coronavirus infection rates and the market support from the central bank of china played into the hands of the us currency as a result on friday february 07 after updating the multi month low the pair found a local bottom at 1 0940 and ended the trading session at 1 0945 gbp usd following the euro the pound lost its position against the dollar an additional pressure is exerted on it by concerns that the uk will still not be able to agree a trade deal with the eu during the post brexit transition period as in the case of eur usd about 15 of oscillators last week gave clear signals about the pair being overbought and graphical analysis predicted a decline in the british currency first to the horizon of 1 2970 and then to the level of 1 2800 in fact the pair s fall stopped on friday february 07 approximately in the middle of the named range in the 1 2880 zone usd jpy the decrease in the rate of the coronavirus infection and the hopes for an early victory over this infection reduce the interest of markets in safe haven currencies such as the japanese yen as a result the pair managed to break the landmark level of 110 00 in the second half of the week and reach the level of 110 016 then there was a rebound and the final chord sounded in the area of a strong medium term support resistance zone at the level of 109 75 cryptocurrencies bitcoin has had the best january in the past seven years the value of the main coin has increased by about 30 percent the volume of capitalization of the asset added about 39 billion according to experts the reason for this rise was the geopolitical situation the approaching halving has also affected the value of bitcoin the last time bitcoin showed such aggressive growth dynamics was in january 2013 then the coin increased in value by about 54 percent it is noteworthy that at that time the asset was also preparing for the halving another reason pushing the btc usd pair up was the coronavirus asian investors are increasingly buying cryptocurrency because of the situation with the coronavirus payments in dollars may be banned so bitcoin and other coins will be the only way out vijay ayyar one of the top managers of the luno crypto exchange said on cnbc also in his opinion the price of bitcoin is affected by the black market many companies from china have closed the export of goods which is why the scale of smuggling paid for with cryptocurrency has increased significantly whatever it was the halving along with the virus and the smugglers have almost pushed bitcoin quotes to the cherished bar of 10 000 on thursday february 06 fully justifying the forecasts of most experts the cost of one coin reached the mark of 9 860 naturally the growth of the leading cryptocurrency gave another impetus to the top altcoins ethereum eth usd reached 223 9 litecoin ltc usd 75 30 and ripple xrp usd 0 2800 as for the forecast for the coming week summarizing the opinions of a number of experts as well as forecasts made on the basis of various methods of technical and graphical analysis we can say the following eur usd over the past week all most popular currency pairs have reached landmark levels eur usd 1 1000 gbp usd 1 3000 and usd jpy 110 which makes the task of forecasting their further movement even more difficult since these levels can act as both a very strong support and resistance at the time of writing this forecast saturday february 08 the situation with indicators for the eur usd pair mirrors what we observed a week ago 100 of trend indicators and 85 of oscillators on h4 and d1 are now colored red and the remaining 15 of the oscillators now signal the pair is oversold and a rebound up is expected 60 of experts supported by graphical analysis on h4 believe that the pair will continue to fall aiming to test the lows of november october 2019 in the area of 1 0880 and if successful it will open the way to the zone of 1 0500 1 0800 where it already visited in 2015 2017 however graphical analysis as a further perspective draws a rebound of the pair from the support of 1 0880 back up first to the resistance of 1 1000 and then another 100 points higher the majority 60 of analysts agree that the pair will reach 1 1100 and 1 1200 again in the medium term as for the macroeconomic analysis next week we will be covered by a whole wave of important events among them are the speech of the fed jerome powell to the us congress the publication of statistics on the consumer markets of germany and the united states on 13 and 14 february and the release of gdp data for germany and eurozone at the end of the week on friday 14 february gbp usd on tuesday february 11 the data on the uk gdp for the 4th quarter of 2019 will also be available it is expected that the increase will be zero which may put additional pressure on the pound it should be noted that the situation with brexit and the monetary policy of the bank of england makes the prospects for the british currency very vague at least now the experts opinions are divided into three almost equal parts 30 are for the growth 30 are for the fall and 40 are for the sideways movement of the pair in the medium term the majority of analysts 65 still hope for the successful promotion of the trade negotiations between britain and the eu as for technical analysis the situation repeats the situation with the eur usd the indicators are colored red and only 15 of the oscillators are in the oversold zone the pair finished the week at the level of1 2880 in the pivot point zone along which it rotated from the end of october to the beginning of december 2019 therefore the nearest borders of its fluctuations are the borders of the same last year s corridor 1 2800 and 1 3000 however the fall of the pound over the past five days by as much as 320 points suggests that it may not stay in the specified channel the next target for the bears is the 1 2400 1 2580 zone if the trend turns up we will see the pair in the 1 2975 1 3200 zone with a pivot point of 1 3100 due to the increased volatility of the pair it is not possible to give more accurate benchmarks recall that in december 2019 it flew more than 600 points in just 10 days usd jpy japan is the most energy dependent country due to the lack of its own energy resources especially now when after blocking several nuclear power plants it was necessary to significantly increase purchases of petroleum products therefore a sharp increase in the price of this energy carrier always leads to a weakening of the japanese currency over the past week the oil market has been experiencing increased volatility in anticipation of the opec committee s decision to reduce the oil production as a result it was decided to reduce its production by 600 000 barrels per day which should stop the fall in the price of black gold the easing of china s trade policy should also support the oil market in particular beijing s decision to reduce duties on us goods worth 75 billion most likely all this affected the growth of the usd jpy pair and the fall of the japanese currency to 110 yen per dollar last week 60 of experts expect that the pair will continue to grow further which will be facilitated not only by the oil factor but also by the improvement of the situation with the coronavirus however we must not forget that since january 06 brent oil futures have fallen by almost 21 from 68 91 to 54 45 which gives reason to the remaining 40 of analysts to side with the japanese currency the technical analysis situation here is as follows on the h4 timeframe 80 of oscillators and 75 of trend indicators look up while on d1 85 of oscillators and 90 of trend indicators are green so there is a clear advantage of bullish sentiment graphical analysis on h4 indicates a drop in the pair to the zone of 109 10 109 30 the following supports are 108 30 and 107 65 on d1 the picture is reversed first growth to the 110 80 111 30 level and then to the 111 70 height the nearest resistance is 1 2575 cryptocurrencies so the price of bitcoin has updated the 3 month high beware of a trend reversal 20 of experts warns against the background of the coronavirus epidemic relations between the us and china may stabilize which will cause an increase in investor interest in fiat currencies in this case bitcoin can sink a lot even without the coronavirus these two industrial giants are moving step by step toward the end of the trade war but how much will this affect the bitcoin quotes 80 of analysts believe that a particularly strong drawdown below 9 100 should not be expected and the pair will soon reach the 10 450 mark and there s 12 300 just around the corner thomas lee co founder of fundstrat global advisors predicts even greater growth in his opinion the average yield on bitcoin in the next six months will reach 200 but as often happens when everyone looks up the price goes down therefore we strongly advise you not to forget about the 20 of specialists who call for extreme caution
could silver break out like it did in 2011 silver is expected to begin the 2020s newly burnished through a combination of higher industrial and investment demand and tightened supply owing to mine production issues and output cuts if it does it would be the continuation of a trend that started last year 2019 was an excellent year for gold and silver both metals began to run last summer after the us federal reserve started cutting interest rates in july the fed lowered rates three times before freezing the benchmark federal funds rate at a range of 1 5 1 75 in november the market is reportedly expecting multiple cuts in 2020 that along with similarly dovish policies among other central banks a record 17 trillion of negative yielding sovereign bonds and fresh safe haven demand due to tensions with iran and a lack of progress on trade talks to name two key issues powered precious metals to new heights spot gold and silver both peaked in early september at a respective 1 552 00 oz and 19 67 oz taking a long term view of silver and gold prices reveals that the precious metals move in almost identical patterns over the last year gold and silver have each gained about 25 trough to peak over the last five years gold gained 45 to silver s 40 charting the metals back to 2010 the correlation is tight when gold goes up it almost always takes silver with it it s actually fascinating to examine these charts closely at face value the red lines appear to show a very similar pattern the spike in both gold and silver happened in 2011 when gold shot up to a record 1 900 an ounce and silver approached 50 oz but in fact silver s streak occurred in april five months before gold s big run this contradicts the prevailing wisdom that silver prices follow gold prices the fun for precious metals investors was short lived by the end of 2011 silver had dropped to below 2010 levels and gold fell to under 1 600 in 2012 as the federal reserve implemented its third round of quantitative easing both metals rebounded gold took off above 1 900 and silver pushed back up to near 50 then the crash of 2013 when gold prices plunged a gravity inducing 200 an ounce over two days and silver fell even more on a percentage basis sinking below 25 for the first time since 2010 silver and gold trade fairly closely for the next six years but diverge towards the end of the chart notice the column between jan 19 and feb 20 at the start of 2019 gold turns sharply upward for a whole year even touching 1 600 very recently silver s move is much more modest it only climbs one square on the chart to gold s three squares representing 15 to 20 an ounce versus gold s 1 300 to 1 600 what happened to cause this anomaly in 2019 we re not sure but we do know that a reliable way to evaluate gold and silver prices is to look at the gold silver ratio the gold silver ratio is simply the amount of silver one can buy with an ounce of gold to find the ratio divide the current gold price by the price of silver on june 12 the gold silver ratio hit a 26 year high by breaking through the 90 ounce mark meaning it took over 90 ounces of silver to purchase one ounce of gold the higher the number the more undervalued is silver or to put it another way the farther gold prices are pulling away from silver prices the gold silver ratio tells precious metals investors which is under valued or over valued silver or gold at the current ratio of 88 1 a trader who has an ounce of gold could sell his gold for 88 ounces of silver compared to the historical average of 56 silver ounces to one gold ounce historically then silver is right now extremely under priced compared to gold incidentally the 2019 gold silver ratio of 86 1 ranks among the highest 2 of all time dating back to 1687 there have been only two years since the us government removed the dollar from the gold peg 1991 and 1992 that there were higher ratios if silver is so under valued we got to thinking what would it take for silver prices to rise to the levels of nearly a decade ago what were the silver market conditions in 2011 that could reveal clues as to where silver is going in 2020 this article attempts to answer these questions 2011 boom and bust there are numerous suppositions as to why silver climbed 175 in one year before suddenly falling off a cliff silver plummeted over 25 in two days many observers looked to investment banks like jp morgan suspected of manipulating the silver market which at the time was known to be shorting silver even though prices kept rising conspiracy theorists recalled what happened to warren buffet s ill fated silver squeeze in the 1990s that propelled the price up 80 before crashing dovish monetary policy at the us federal reserve was another reason to be bullish on precious metals in early 2011 three years after the great recession the us economy was still reeling from the mortgage crisis and collapse of lehman brothers confidence in the us economy was at a record low the eurozone was in trouble with greece ireland portugal italy and spain all reporting financial problems the fed announced a third round of quantitative easing and reaffirmed it would hold interest rates at zero for at least two years in august 2011 the swiss national bank stunned financial markets by promising to print the swiss franc in unlimited quantities as necessary to maintain a peg between the franc and the euro resulting in a flood of investments out of the franc and into other safe haven currencies or precious metals elsewhere in europe central banks remained committed to resolving the debt crisis by even more borrowing the result of all of these economic factors including a belief that the dollar was under siege was for investors to seek safe haven assets like gold and silver a more intricate reasoning for silver s rise involved the use of silver in solar panels this theory begins with the belief that industrial demand for silver was surging in 2011 due in part to the photovoltaic industry consuming silver in much higher quantities than previously supply wasn t able to keep up leaving a shortfall this it turns out wasn t quite true while the industry did experience massive growth between 2008 and 2011 silver demand rose 338 it barely registered as a demand driver according to bullionvault the silver market was also thought to be tight due to a shortage of high purity bars required for the silver paste that goes into solar panels these 0 9999 fine silver bars are less common than the regular 0 999 bars so when the supply of high purity bars ran low corresponding with the hike in the silver price a cause and effect was assumed there was in fact a shortage of 0 9999 bars but the supply of raw material mined silver remained well stocked between 2003 and 2012 the silver market was in a significant surplus six times bullionvault notes whatever the reason or reasons for its jump silver s surprising journey to 49 stopped abruptly in mid september 2011 initiated by then fed chairman ben bernanke s decision not to proceed with more quantitative easing money metals exchange explains what happened next disappointed long traders began selling their contracts as prices fell the margin calls began forcing weak hands to sell then major u s and asian exchanges increased margin requirements the result of these rapid fire events was a near term rout in the paper prices for gold and silver the precious metal plunged from a peak of 49 an ounce to under 40 within a week silver s biggest three day plunge in 28 years silver investors and traders know the metal to be thinly traded and therefore volatile but the scope of the correction raised eyebrows some traders blamed the unwinding of the long silver short dollar hedge for the scale of the correction the telegraph quotes the president of the precious metals trading firm dillon gage saying us investors bought silver and gold as a way to hedge against further erosion in the dollar s buying power conspiracy theorists appeared to be validated when a rumor circulated about massive selling out of george soros s hedge fund in the following weeks a lawsuit was filed against jp morgan and hsbc alleging market manipulation however both the cftc and a new york appeals court found no indications of collusion or criminal abuse of the silver market gold silver ratio as indicator wouldn t it be great if we had a tried and true forecasting tool that could tell us when silver and gold prices are going to take off of course possessing such a thing would stand to make us a lot of money sadly we don t what we do have is the gold silver ratio and the knowledge that the precious metals usually move in the same direction although silver historically leaps faster and higher than gold as mentioned at the top the current gold silver ratio of 88 1 is near historic highs for the ratio to drop either gold needs to fall or silver to rise the question silver investors want answered is when are rising silver prices going to bring the ratio down to a more reasonable level that reflects the bullish fundamentals for silver we get some help here from a may 2019 column in kitco authored by renowned mining investor and commentator lobo tiggre he notices that since 2011 instead of trailing along with gold silver keeps getting cheaper and cheaper relative to gold so what gives we don t know the answer to why silver investors aren t acting on the flashing red neon buy now sign indicated by the high gold silver ratio but according to jason hamlin a commodities analyst writing in seeking alpha the ratio is one of the most reliable buy indicators for silver whenever it is above 80 ie now silver mines ltd managing director anthony mclure confirms this reportedly telling the denver gold forum last september that the higher than normal ratio is often the precursor to a bull run peter schiff in a recent column states that because silver is despite its many industrial uses still a monetary metal it tends to track relatively consistently with gold over time when gold goes up it almost always takes silver with it furthermore it may well mean the silver gold ratio will shrink again as it did in the years after the 08 crash historically during a bull market in gold silver outperforms if this holds trues that ratio will close conclusion the silver market today is obviously quite different from the one in 2011 that saw silver jump to an all time high of 49 an ounce could it run that far again we believe so consider industrial demand for silver particularly photovoltaics is heading up and should get another lift if and when the trade war with china is put to rest investment demand for silver also looks solid with no end in sight to the low interest rate policy direction of central banks add higher demand to shrinking supply lower grades and less silver by product credits from falling lead and zinc mine production we see a floor forming under silver prices the 88 1 gold silver ratio is very high by historical standards this is a warning to investors that at any time the ratio could correct either meaning a move up in silver prices or a move down in gold prices gold is holding up very well despite a phase 1 trade deal with china a continued strong dollar and higher sovereign bond yields in the us than elsewhere at aoth we do not believe the gold price is going to fall quite the opposite peter schiff states silver has hit an all time high of 49 per ounce twice in january 1980 and then again in april 2011 if you adjust that 49 high for inflation you re looking at a price of around 150 per ounce in other words silver has a long way to run up as one analyst put it with the long term downside potential of silver very low versus its current valuation the risk reward is one of the best investments on the planet we don t know what will be the catalyst that makes silver leap again like it did in 2011 or when it will happen but one thing is for sure when silver runs volatility will be high it will likely spike fast without warning and probably percentage wise much higher than gold by richard rick mills www

the number of confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus which originated from wuhan continues to spiral worldwide so it is still difficult to estimate its impact on the global economy these economic uncertainties have led central banks around the world to cut interest rates or ease monetary policy although the people s bank of china has not taken any action to lower the reserve ratio requirement because of the outbreak it has released funds worth 1 2 trillion yuan into the market through actions such as reverse repurchases at the same time russia which only has a few confirmed cases of the virus also adjusted its key interest rate by 25 basis points to 6 percent last friday with the bank of russia indicating that since the inflation rate is still lower than expected it is likely to continue cutting interest rates at its next meeting in addition to russia at least 11 central banks synchronized global monetary easing last week including the bank of thailand and the bangko sentral ng pilipinas which also cut interest rates last week so why did this pneumonia outbreak prompt central banks around the world to act so quickly as the international monetary fund president kristalina georgieva pointed out when sars broke out in 2002 2003 china accounted for only 4 percent of the global economy and there was only a 0 1 percent damper on global growth once the epidemic was contained however china today accounts for 18 percent of the global economy therefore the effect of the coronavirus on the world s economy will be more severe than what sars inflicted this is why the imf wants central banks around the world to pursue quantitative easing georgieva said pointing out that 49 central banks cut interest rates in 2019 lifting economic growth by half a percentage point at the moment central banks in emerging markets have been the first to take action since their countries have already been under pressure even before outbreak of the novel coronavirus because of the trade war between china and the united states russia s central bank in fact cut rates five times last year now the epidemic is making central banks in these the emerging markets speed up rate cuts or take action on quantitative easing after the pboc made a comprehensive cut in the rrr on january 1 the market expected that another cut would not be made until the second quarter at the earliest however many analysts now believe that the pboc will make another rrr cut this quarter to counter the effects of the outbreak so can these actions by the central banks actually boost the economy the vast majority of investors believe that the global economy will inevitably be affected in the first quarter especially as china s gdp may fall to 5 percent or even lower according to a leading government economist but once the outbreak is gradually contained and dissipates one should not underestimate the economic rebound that will take place as global liquidity will sharply increase thanks to the actions of central banks around the world this will not only help the global economy rebound significantly but could even lead to higher inflation according to analysts which is an absolute advantage to asset prices including the stock markets take a look at the msci emerging markets index which has rebounded 3 77 percent in the past week though we can t say it has shrugged off the effect of the coronavirus the rebound reflects the efforts of central banks and certainly gives investors the confidence and incentive to enter the market andrew wong is chairman and ceo of anli securities
pakistan was economically prosperous during the 1980s and today it is among the poorest its current gdp growth is estimated close to 2 percent barely sufficient to keep pace with population growth as i stated in my op ed published in daily times dec 2019 pakistan is bankrupt last year the sum of interest payments due to the government s debt obligations and pension payments owed to retired employees was more than the federal government s net revenue pakistan is running on borrowed money sadly some pakistanis are instinctively aware and the political leaders and bureaucrats know it but continue stealing the borrowed money as if tomorrow will never come people elected pakistan tehreek e insaf on the promise that it will bring about a change however as of today it is a complete disaster it has not only reduced economic growth but has also implemented policies that will make pakistan bankrupt in a nutshell imf and khan s programs have produced disastrous results for pakistan every time the imf gets involved expect failed economic results political instability the harsh cookie cutter conditions of the fund and lack of ownership by anyone have resulted in failed less effective imf programs throughout its 61 year history pakistan has gone to the imf 21 times most of these times should be considered bailouts as of march 2019 the public debt of pakistan was about 35 094 trillion which is 91 2 percent of the country s gross domestic product gdp the government owes about 18 17 trillion to domestic creditors and about 1 378 trillion to public sector enterprises pses pakistan also has an external debt of around us 105 billion of which it owes us 11 3 billion to the paris club us 27 billion to multilateral donors us 5 765 billion to the international monetary fund and us 12 billion to international bonds such as eurobond and sukuk about a fifth of the external debt us 19 billion is owed to china the trouble is that the imf loans come with conditions such as improving tax collection and ending utility subsidies that in essence set the economic policy agenda for the khan government these conditions will result in further economic disaster meanwhile the country s accumulated debt was 72 5 percent of gdp in 2018 up from 67 20 percent in 2017 and external debt jumped to 106891 usd million in the third quarter of 2019 from 99086 usd million in the fourth quarter of 2018 furthermore foreign currency reserves and foreign capital flows have been falling rapidly also pakistan had borrowed billions of dollars in loans from friendly countries including china saudi arabia and the united arab emirates but even that was not enough to cover the interest payments on past debts dawn jan 31 2020 reported that the government admitted to major violations of the fiscal responsibility and debt limitation act frdla for massively exceeding debt acquisition limits in public debt and liabilities in 15 months as of february 1 2020 the total debt and liabilities stood at rs 29 879 trillion at the end of the fiscal year 2018 crossed rs 41 489tr at the end of september 2019 showing an increase of rs11 6tr or 39pc at the end of the fiscal year 2019 the total debt and liabilities have increased by about 35pc or rs 10 344tr to touch rs 40 223tr on top of that the federal fiscal deficit excluding grants was rs 3 635 billion or 9 4pc of gdp during fy 2018 19 thus remaining higher than the threshold of four percent because of the tremendous spending loans and required payment of interest on the loan khan will have to continue begging the imf for the loan with conditions that will put pakistan in a more desperate situation than it was before the trouble is that the imf loans come with conditions such as improving tax collection and ending utility subsidies that in essence set the economic policy agenda for the khan government these conditions will result in further economic disaster in addition because of high interest payment the required cost of the military and the retirees and higher than high normal corruption i predict that pakistan will be knocking on the imf and other doors for more loans next year as the politicians and bureaucrats have already stolen or wasted most of the recent loans thanks to khan pakistan has raised its corruption index by 3 from 117 to 120 out of 180 in 2019 i predict that by the time khan is out of the office pakistan s corruption index will go even higher by more than ten points in three and a half years i e 130 or more some pakistanis call the current government as the second most corrupt regime in the history of pakistan very few pakistanis pay income taxes but the imf wants a rapid increase in tax collection without explaining how to accomplish it in addition the imf wants major cuts in government spending and it is fully aware that the austerity will invariably cause a growth slowdown to make matters worse the imf is also demanding higher spending cuts on services for the poor and investment in poor areas additionally the imf wants to end subsidies for gas and electricity and require price controls for some items to be set by an independent body despite the required spending cuts by the imf khan is borrowing and spending like there is no tomorrow dawn reported feb 2 2020 that fbr report finds high ranking officials involved in large scale corruption in a public speech given at pind dadan khan on dec 26 2019 pm imran khan had referred to corruption in the customs department by saying we found one collector customs in one area who was earning rs70 crore per month it proves pakistan does not need more income taxes it needs to collect what it is legally owed sadly the imf never conditioned its loan on curbing corruption the suggested policy of controlling prices shows the naivety of the imf sadly it has forgotten the history of u s price controls in the 1970s under president nixon it almost destroyed the economy repeating the same failed policy which will result in economic disaster shows that incompetent uneducated people run the imf its incompetence further proves my point of why no country s leaders should ever let the imf near their country as most of its suggestions are unrealistic and result in economic and social disaster yahoo reported jan 20 2020 that because of price control wheat has disappeared from the market in pakistan and bread makers have closed their shops as they cannot make money with the suggested price set for nan here is another proof of the unrealistic imf and khan policies and more to come to further warn the international financial institutions of their laissez faire attitude about the loans atif mian has stated that if an airplane took off a dozen times only to come crashing down each time the only logical conclusion would be that the aircraft requires a fundamental redesign pakistan s economy like the airplane has crashed 13 times or more in the last 60 years each time requiring an international monetary fund bailout the new york times dec 10 2019 i hope that now imf wakes up and realizes that it is incapable of solving anyone s problems and will stop interfering in the economic problems of other countries however i am sure that they will not heed my advice because i suspect the motives of both the imf and pakistan are selfish which makes them continue their disastrous economic involvement with no end in sight the writer is phd usa professor emeritus usa

source new dispensation promises a mirage newsday zimbabwe february 9 2020 by phillip chidavaenzi ordinary people including civil servants and many in the informal sector have become increasingly disillusioned with president emmerson mnangagwa s highly touted new dispensation anchored on economic development which seemingly have collapsed in spectacular fashion a snap survey by newsday weekender revealed that many ordinary people believe the political elites who live in the lap of comfort and luxury were far removed from the hardships of a population at its wits end on how to live through the next day when it was first rumoured that mnangagwa was considering mthuli ncube for the post of finance minister there was a ripple of public excitement given the man s glossy cv but in just two years those who have been hit hard by the continued downward spiral of the economy have even been suggesting that for all his ills the late former president robert mugabe was probably a better leader who felt for the people and pushed pro poor policies with the majority of ordinary zimbabweans earning less than 2 000 a month surviving through the month has become a tall order according to the poverty reduction forum trust prft s basic needs basket survey which monitors the cost of accessing basic needs in urban areas by october last year a family of five required 4 307 16 for their basic needs before the re introduction of the zimbabwe dollar us 100 was sufficient to fill a trolley of groceries but now 100 in local currency is not even sufficient to purchase four litres of cooking oil several people who spoke to this publication revealed that they were no longer doing monthly budgets like in the past but were now living from day to day a researcher and development economist with prft tafara chiremba said the increasing cost of living demanded families to be more prudent in their spending habits they need to have a plan on the basic needs when they will need to buy and where they can buy goods at cheaper prices he said given availability of income there is need for households to buy goods that can last a month in the face of increasing inflation and cost of transport this strategy can help households to save money in january this year civil servants agreed to a 140 pay hike after the top public workers union apex council had earlier rejected a government offer to double the pay for the government employees saying it was too little they eventually settled for a pay deal where the lowest paid state employees would get 2 450 up from 1 033 a month with people forking out between 8 and 10 for a single trip into the central business district using public transport that translates to between 320 and 500 for transport the whole month if the individual has three children who commute to school everyday the figure would treble in a bid to alleviate the transport woes the government availed a subsidised facility for public transport through the zimbabwe united passenger company zupco where an individual would pay just 1 or 2 for a single trip into town but the buses have proved too few in light of the demand for affordable transport in december last year the parliamentary portfolio committee on local government indicated that the zupco bus management scheme was gobbling 51 million per month with committee chairperson miriam chikukwa claiming the money was not enough according to chiremba while it was the responsibility of government to provide social protection to vulnerable groups such did not have to be reactionary by any standard the zupco buses are also in limited supply hence they are not able to cater for all zimbabweans who need cheaper transport in the face of inflation and general increase in cost of living he observed the programme itself is a reactionary measure and it is not addressing the root of the problems that have led the country to where it is right now rentals in high density suburbs where landlords have now opted to charge in united states dollars to lock value are now going for between us 10 and us 12 a room which roughly translates to about 250 in local currency with a kilogramme of beef costing between 85 and 150 many families have cut their beef rations for alternatives such as soya mince beans and a variety of vegetables to remain within their monthly budgets though dismissed in government as a joke mnangagwa s encouragement for people to opt for vegetables following concerns that meat was now too expensive was viewed as a show of how those in power were far removed from

authored by lance roberts via realinvestmentadvice com in 2007 i was at a conference where paul mcculley who was with pimco at the time was discussing the idea of a minsky moment at that time this idea fell on deaf ears as the markets and economy were in full swing however it wasn t too long before the 2008 financial crisis brought the minsky moment thesis to the forefront what was revealed of course was the dangers of profligacy which resulted in the triggering of a wave of margin calls a massive selloff in assets to cover debts and higher default rates so what exactly is a minsky moment economist hyman minsky argued that the economic cycle is driven more by surges in the banking system and in the supply of credit than by the relationship which is traditionally thought more important between companies and workers in the labor market in other words during periods of bullish speculation if they last long enough the excesses generated by reckless speculative activity will eventually lead to a crisis of course the longer the speculation occurs the more severe the crisis will be hyman minsky argued there is an inherent instability in financial markets he postulated that an abnormally long bullish economic growth cycle would spur an asymmetric rise in market speculation which would eventually result in market instability and collapse a minsky moment crisis follows a prolonged period of bullish speculation which is also associated with high amounts of debt taken on by both retail and institutional investors one way to look at leverage as it relates to the financial markets is through margin debt and in particular the level of free cash investors have to deploy in periods of high speculation investors are likely to be levered borrow money to invest which leaves them with negative cash balances while margin balances did decline in 2018 as the markets fell due to the federal reserve hiking rates and reducing their balance sheet it is notable that current levels of leverage are still excessively higher than they were either in 1999 or 2007 this is also seen by looking at the s p 500 versus the growth rate of margin debt the mainstream analysis dismisses margin debt under the assumption that it is the reflection of bullish attitudes in the market leverage fuels the market rise in the early stages of an advance this is correct however in the later stages of an advance when bullish optimism and speculative behaviors are at the peaks leverage has a dark side to it as i discussed previously at some point a reversion process will take hold it is when investor psychology collides with leverage and the problems associated with market liquidity it will be the equivalent of striking a match lighting a stick of dynamite and throwing it into a tanker full of gasoline that moment is the minsky moment as noted these reversion of bullish excess are not a new thing in the book the cost of capitalism robert barbera s discussed previous periods in history the last five major global cyclical events were the early 1990s recession largely occasioned by the u s savings loan crisis the collapse of japan inc after the stock market crash of 1990 the asian crisis of the mid 1990s the fabulous technology boom bust cycle at the turn of the millennium and the unprecedented rise and then collapse for u s residential real estate in 2007 2008 all five episodes delivered recessions either global or regional in no case was there as significant prior acceleration of wages and general prices in each case an investment boom and an associated asset market ran to improbably heights and then collapsed from 1945 to 1985 there was no recession caused by the instability of investment prompted by financial speculation and since 1985 there has been no recession that has not been caused by these factors read that last sentence again interestingly it was post 1970 the federal reserve became active in trying to control interest rates and inflation through monetary policy as noted in the fed the stability instability paradox in the u s the federal reserve has been the catalyst behind every preceding financial event since they became active monetarily policy wise in the late 70 s as shown in the chart below when the fed has lifted the short term lending rates to a level higher than the 2 year rate bad stuff has historically followed the fed is doing it again as noted above minsky moment crises occur because investors engaging in excessively aggressive speculation take on additional credit risk during prosperous times or bull markets the longer a bull market lasts the more investors borrow to try and capitalize on market moves however it hasn t just been investors tapping into debt to capitalize on the bull market advance but corporations have gorged on debt for unproductive spending dividend issuance and share buybacks as i noted in last week s macroview we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us since the economy is driven by consumption and theoretically companies should be taking on debt for productive purposes to meet rising demand analyzing corporate debt relative to underlying economic growth gives us a view on leverage levels the problem with debt of course is it is leverage that has to be serviced by underlying cash flows of the business while asset prices have surged to historic highs corporate profits for the entirety of u s business have remained flat since 2014 such doesn t suggest the addition of leverage is being done to grow profits but rather to sustain them over the last decade the federal reserve s ongoing liquidity interventions zero interest rates and maintaining extremely accommodative policies has led to substantial increases in speculative investment such was driven by the belief that if something breaks the fed will be there to fix to it despite a decade long economic expansion record stock market prices and record low unemployment the fed continues to support financial speculation through ongoing interventions john authers recently penned an excellent piece on this issue for bloomberg why does liquidity look quite so bullish as ever we can thank central banks and particularly the federal reserve twelve months ago the u s central bank intended to restrict liquidity steadily by shrinking the assets on its balance sheet on auto pilot that changed though it reversed course and then cut rates three times and most importantly it started to build its balance sheet again in an attempt to shore up the repo market which banks use to access short term finance when it suddenly froze up in september in terms of the increase in u s liquidity over 12 months by crossborder s measures this was the biggest liquidity boost ever while john believes we are early in the global liquidity cycle i personally am not so sure given the magnitude of the increase central bank balance sheets over the last decade currently global central bank balance sheets have grown from roughly 5 trillion in 2007 to 21 trillion currently in other words central bank balance sheets are equivalent to the size of the entire u s economy in 2007 the global stock market capitalization was 65 trillion in 2019 the global stock market capitalization hit 85 trillion which was an increase of 20 trillion or roughly equivalent to the expansion of the central bank balance sheets in the u s there has been a clear correlation between the fed s balance sheet expansions and speculative risk taking in the financial markets is another minsky moment looming the international monetary fund imf has been issuing global warnings of high debt levels and slowing global economic growth which has the potential to result in minsky moment crises around the globe while this has not come to fruition yet the warning signs are there globally there is roughly 15 trillion in negative yielding debt with asset prices fundamentally detached for corporate profitability and excessive valuations on multiple levels as desmond lachman wrote how else can one explain that the risky u s leveraged loan market has increased to more than 1 3 trillion and that the size of today s global leveraged loan market is some two and a half times the size of the u s subprime market in 2008 or how else can one explain that in 2017 argentina was able to place a 100 year bond or that european high yield borrowers can place their debt at negative interest rates or that as dysfunctional and heavily indebted government as that of italy can borrow at a lower interest rate than that of the united states or that the government of greece can borrow at negative interest rates these are all clear indications that speculative excess is present in the markets currently however there is one other prime ingredient needed to complete the environment for a minsky moment to occur that ingredient is complacency yet despite the clearest signs that global credit has been grossly misallocated and that global credit risk has been seriously mispriced both markets and policymakers seem to be remarkably sanguine it would seem that the furthest thing from their minds is that once again we could experience a minsky moment involving a violent repricing of risky assets that could cause real strains in the financial markets desmond is correct currently despite record asset prices leverage debt combined with slowing economic growth the level of complacency is extraordinarily high given that no one currently believes another credit related crisis can occur is what is needed to allow one to happen professor minsky taught that markets have short memories and that they repeatedly delude themselves into believing that this time will be different sadly judging by today s market exuberance in the face of mounting economic and political risks once again minsky is likely to be proved correct at this point in the cycle the next minsky moment is inevitable all that is missing is the catalyst to start the ball rolling an unexpected recession would more than likely due to trick
washington after emerging intact from his impeachment and trial us president donald trump can now trumpet his economic record as he battles to win re election in november the businessman turned politician inherited an economy in the upswing from his predecessor barack obama recovering from the ravages of the 2008 global financial crisis and rather than falter or die of old age the expansion has continued through trump s first three years in office giving him a trump card in the campaign to win a second term in november but there are some chinks in his armor as well as growing fears about the economic damage done by the coronavirus outbreak in china which raise doubts about how long the good times can last jobs gains continue jobs jobs jobs the president tweeted friday following a blockbuster employment report showing the us economy created 225 000 jobs last month he used the hashtag promisesmadepromiseskept last year job growth averaged 175 000 compared to 193 000 in 2018 and 176 000 in 2017 slower than the final three years of the obama administration the unemployment rate now at 3 6 percent near its lowest point in 50 years compared to 4 7 percent in december 2016 obama s last full month in office and joblessness in the hispanic and black communities has tumbled to historic lows for african americans the unemployment rate fell to 5 9 percent in december from 7 8 percent in december 2016 for hispanics it dropped to 4 2 percent from 5 9 percent average hourly earnings increased 2 9 percent in 2019 keeping slightly ahead of inflation record growth the economy is now in its 11th year of expansion a record period of growth but has fallen short of trump s lofty promises after reaching 1 5 percent gdp growth in 2016 the last year of obama s term in 2017 it climbed to 2 3 percent and the following year to 2 9 percent thanks to stimulus from the massive tax cut aimed mostly at corporations and the wealthiest americans and increased government spending particularly on the military but growth slowed to 2 3 percent last year after trump s trade war with china intensified which discouraged business investment while the us is in better shape than most advanced economies the eurozone grew only 1 2 percent it is unlikely to see long periods of 3 0 percent or higher as trump promised treasury secretary steven mnuchin said this week the economy could have hit the target last year were it not for the problems faced by boeing the aerospace giant has been in crisis mode since its top selling 737 max aircraft was grounded in march 2019 following two fatal crashes which shut down exports of the plane the imf predicts us growth will slow even further this year to 2 0 percent as the boost from the tax cut fades away deficits climbing the tax cuts approved by congress at the end of 2017 the most significant tax reform in 30 years helped boost gdp growth but also drove government debt and the deficit higher the reform cut income taxes on the richest americans while slashing the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent the budget deficit is projected to breach 1 trillion by the end of september according to the congressional budget office while government debt is expected to represent 81 percent of us gdp mnuchin said trump is planning to slash taxes for the middle class as well trade tensions eased trump has congratulated himself on signing a momentous initial trade deal last month to end the long battle with beijing but at what cost china pledged to buy some 200 billion in us goods but tariffs on about two thirds of the goods traded between the economic powers remain in place and the conflict slowed us and global growth and sent domestic manufacturing into a recession trump did fulfill his campaign promise to renegotiate the 1994 continental free trade deal with mexico and canada creating the usmca the new pact also signed in january replaces what trump called the worst trade deal in us history though experts say it amounts to an update rather than an overhaul booming stock market wall street has cheered the tax cuts and loosening of regulations by the trump administration gaining around 55 percent since he was elected on november 8 2016 that will be another selling point to americans whose retirement wealth depends in large part on stock prices

pen pals dryly noted that this is because of the czech equivalent of hyperinflation a whopping 3 2 year on year in december but on a more serious note monetary authorities are keeping their eyes on what they should above target inflation and ignoring transitory hopefully external shocks to domestic activity the market s reaction was predictable bonds down the currency up meanwhile elsewhere in emerging markets yep it s more policy easing but with caveats we ve got stealth easing in india rates on hold but keeping accommodative stance a 25bps cut in brazil a hawkish one though the central

as we move through a new year and new decade what will 2020 bring for business in jamaica more of the same or something different let me admit up front i do not hold or pretend to hold any special powers to predict the future i wish i did and who wouldn t but sorry i don t all i can do much like anyone else is make a best guess but not a best guess based on feeling or best wishes but on data analysis known and immerging patterns and connecting the dots so let s do just that for 2020 last year saw jamaica further improve its macro economic stability with the indicators pointing in the right direction but what of economic growth as finance minister dr nigel clarke and others have acknowledged while macro economic stability is a critical condition for economic growth by itself it is not enough to spur greater levels of economic growth and the results speak for themselves headlines delivered to your inbox sign up for the gleaner s morning and evening newsletters the jamaican economy grew according to the statistical institute of jamaica statin at a low 0 6 per cent for the june to september quarter of 2019 the last reported period of 2019 this makes for 19 consecutive quarters of economic growth which is the longest unbroken stretch of economic growth since jamaica started measuring growth quarterly in 1997 this growth while low did occur under challenging circumstances locally and internationally for example locally we saw the closure of the jisco alpart plant represented a 17 6 per cent decline in jamaica s output of bauxite alumina and internationally the trade war between the united states and china saw a drag on global growth so what will change this picture for jamaica what guided the list i chose the list based on several factors including but not limited to the convergence of various government policy investments enhanced and emerging business opportunities and infrastructural decisions made by the government private sector and civil society in 2019 and preceding years certain patterns have emerged that should make 2020 best guess a very special one for business in jamaica top 10 business trends here are my top 10 trends placed in no order of priority 1 jamaica stock exchange the number one ranked stock exchange according to bloomberg in 2018 will continue its stellar performance with even more initial public offering ipos and additional public offerings apos the money raised will further fuel the expansion of businesses locally and offer jamaicans an opportunity to invest the government through the listing of transjamaica highway and jps will continue its policy as it did with wigton ipo where over 30 000 jamaicans participated 2 tourism growth the preliminary report from the jamaica tourist board jtb is showing that in 2019 tourism earned between us 3 7 billion and us 3 8 billion from approximately 4 4 million visitors which is a us 500 million increase from 2018 this success was underscored by an increase in the retention of tourist spend locally from us30 cents in 2016 to us40 8 cents in 2019 the retention earnings are set to improve with greater linkages between tourism and local attractions entertainment and food events 3 special economic zones special economic zones sez a geographically designated area where fiscal and other incentives are used to attract investment to a country are expanding globally there are more than 5 400 sezs in over 147 countries including jamaica after the mammoth task undertaken in 2019 by the special economic zone authority jseza of transitioning jamaica s freezones over to sez we now have approximately 104 entities across 140 locations in 11 parishes with sez status as either developers or occupants while the sez are frequently associated with the business process outsourcing bpo sector bpo while an important sector is but one of a variety of economic activities undertaken in the sezs in 2020 expect greater growth in the bpo logistics manufacturing and creative industries with expanded opportunities for non sez local businesses through stronger linkages and higher domestic inputs being sourced from the local economy additionally sezs will experience growth in jamaica by introducing new business models reflective opportunities presented by global value chains in the as a service model for example research as a service data as a service distribution as a service etc we already see sez companies like canco limited in st thomas with its food manufacturing standards certifications leading the way by offering manufacturing as a service likewise a subsidiary of west indies petroleum offering oil storage as a service in port esquivel 4 further bpo growth the bpo sector has unquestionably been one of the best performing in 2019 the sector is currently undergoing a transformation moving into greater value added and knowledge intensive activities according to the business process industry association of jamaica bpiaj now the global services association of jamaica gsaj the sector employs approximately 36 000 jamaicans and is segmented with 80 per cent customer service 18 per cent knowledge process and two per cent information technology outsourcing 5 the ferry economic cluster buildout a cluster is emerging in the ferry st catherine area that most people have not fully recognised the power of at least not yet the 94 acre kingston 876 commercial complex is being built out by the cascade group jamaica and includes the 60 million headquarters for tropical battery the current build out of ceac outsourcing company limited s ceac 100 000 square feet bpo focused sez and the already built 7 000 square metre nestlé jamaica distribution hub when completed kingston 876 is expected to host 30 35 operations the ferry area also hosts tank weld equipment ltd the sole dealer for shacman trucks for the caribbean derrimon trading is leasing space from tank weld to build out a 100 million distribution hub what makes the ferry so special its location it is close to the port of kingston three major population centres kingston portmore and spanish town and it has great connectivity to both the east west and north south highways 6 improved road network it goes without saying that roads are important to economic development nevertheless roads by themselves do not induce sustainable growth however roads that facilitate the movement of goods services and or people more efficiently not only introduce cost savings but new opportunities for earnings and these are the conditions that many of the more than 400 roads that were resurfaced and rehabilitated in 2019 offer jamaica the prime minister said it best at the ground breaking for the southern coastal highway improvement project reducing the distance between people market services and knowledge is a great part of what economic growth is all about the flow of goods capital technology and people will drive economic growth and create a broader space for development and prosperity for all 7 drones the global commercial drone market is estimated at a value of us 5 80 billion and is projected to grow tenfold in five years by barclays this is a fourth industrial revolution technology that has tremendous job creation prospects in jamaica the more immediate opportunities will be seen in various services industries in 2020 expect drone usage to expand into construction private security precision agriculture to deliver fertiliser herbicides and pesticides the most exciting opportunity will be in tourism with drone flying as a service where tourists can fly around the beautiful landscape of jamaica and take pictures and videos this is a winning formula to enhance jamaican tourism in the 21st century the great thing about drone flying as a service is that it represents a low hanging fruit that locals can get involved in build the market and dominate 8 the bank of jamaica monetary transmission mechanism one of the perennial complaints of jamaican businesses especially the msme sector is access to credit at reasonable and affordable rates while there has been much improvement in this area for many msmes the interest rates being offered by financial institutions are still far too high in response the bank of jamaica boj undertook a set of policy rates the rates that financial institutions borrow from the boj reductions reaching 0 5 per cent by the end of 2019 the reductions were done to drive credit expansion by making money less expensive to borrow it has not fully worked as acknowledged by boj governor richard byles when he said that while this faster growth of private sector credit is a positive signal we are of the view that this expansion in credit is still not fast enough particularly in the context of where domestic activity remains below the economy s potential or capacity this suggests that an even faster pace of credit growth is possible without causing inflation to rise above the inflation target importantly the governor clearly signalled that the way forward would not be business as usual when he exclaimed that whatever blockage is in the system that is causing the rates to not go down as fast i want them to talk why we are not seeing a better transmission of the policy rate reductions to borrowers 9 lng the new 194 mw jamaica public service company ltd liquified natural gas lng plant and the new fortress lng terminal both in old harbour st catherine have changed jamaica s energy landscape forever the latter ought to be watched keenly because of its wider implications for development economic growth and job creation the terminal is part of larger plans to position jamaica as an lng hub within a global logistics and trade hub additionally it has opened opportunities for further economic diversification and investment in food processing industries cold logistics pharmaceuticals manufacturing of chemicals and plastics however the biggest thing to watch is in the possibility of a data centre by new fortress data centres are critical infrastructure in cloud computing where depending on its size and configuration tech companies like google apple microsoft etc perform or receive services ranging from data storage infrastructure as a service data as a service data analytics etc for data centres energy is their largest operating expense largely due to the cooling required for the computer servers jamaica offers a globally unique solution for data centres by combing a variety of technologies the potential combination of lng for power generation cryogenics lng is shipped at a very cold 160 c for cooling renewables such as solar wind and deep water cooling from the sea puts new fortress in a great position to put jamaica on the map in growing the data centre and cloud computing market estimated by bloomberg to be worth us 36 7 billion 10 logistics opening new possibilities with the improving road network improved port and airport infrastructure raising of money on the stock exchange by logistics companies and the build out of more warehouse space especially as sezs 2020 will be a year for logistics mailpac listed on the jamaica stock exchange in the latter part of 2019 raising money to fund its growth and expansion in response to the growing e commerce market in jamaica another example to watch is howard mitchell s aircraft cargo and handler provider ajas limited and its plans to list on the junior stock exchange in 2020 the funds raised according to mitchell would finance its expansion in response to keeping pace with increased passenger and cargo volumes additionally he pointed out that there is interest coming from the middle east about using jamaica as an aviation hub finally we cannot forget wisynco national baking company and knutsford express all of which either announced or commenced logistics projects in 2019 this sampling of private projects is the logistics hub in motion using the infrastructure laid down by the government and transforming jamaica into a logistics centred economy ainsley brown is the senior director regulations policy monitoring and enforcement at jamaica s special economic zone authority and an adjunct lecturer in logistics at the mona school of business and management
are we the people presiding over the failure of the great american experiment a blueprint for recovering our government from money ben cress follow 13 min read jan 19 2020 listen share watching the change in america s politics for 30 years i have felt anger fear disappointment shock futility disillusioned sad discouraged infuriated and hopeless but never apathy i have always believed the american people have the character and the will to not let our democracy fail i am beginning to waiver in that belief but i have not given up on us history has recorded many democracies that have self destructed and america is not immune indeed many others have predicted it is imminent but destruction of our democracy is inevitable only if we the people decide to do nothing to prevent it we have witnessed america reduced to a nation controlled by a small group of ultra wealthy people corporations and the bi partisan campaign contribution purchase of professional politicians those are traits of a plutocracy government by the wealthy democracy eventually exists in name only when a plutocracy supplants it and it will make the people living under it feel like their votes do not count which may be one reason only about 50 of us vote we the people have all the power but have ceded that power and abdicated our duty to cast an informed vote the sole purpose of my article is to present a blueprint to we the people to take control of american politics professional politicians on both sides have divided us and we are on the verge of being conquered to reverse this we must set aside our partisan differences to achieve three common goals 1 provide a forum for all grassroots candidates instead of simply accepting the professional politicians the political parties support 2 negate the need for money in 2020 to run for office and eventually eliminate money from campaigns entirely 3 ensure that candidates for office and office holders are sufficiently held to account by discussing their values in detailed weekly discussions the past few decades have demonstrated that a few wealthy people corporations and the professional politicians have not created a fair and just society through governmental policy their policy priorities were tax cuts for corporations cutting social programs and tax cuts for the wealthy and the result of that focus is a stressed and discouraged society the professional politicians in congress and some states have committed economic mismanagement of social investments and created policies that have resulted in the demise of the middle class another example of the mismanagement is for politicians to observe the middle class being decimated the past few decades in part by a global economy and technology and do little or nothing to re train or educate those who suffered loss of their jobs homes and standard of living we the people have the constitutional means to take control of our government reject plutocracy and re establish democracy we don t have to risk our lives as some are doing in other countries we can decide to take control of america s political process or we can decide to accept living in a plutocracy out of respect for the many freedoms we inherited from those who have defended america when democracy has been challenged externally and now internally americans have a duty to make a conscience choice democracy or plutocracy the choice is too profound and everlasting to make a decision by default what is needed is thinking deeper and reasoning together to win this battle for america to put this in perspective below are a few of the legislative and societal results when we the people allow professional politicians political parties and the moneyed interests that support them to avoid accountability some of what has happened in america in recent decades as condensed below is maddening even overwhelming so you may want to scroll down to the blueprint political campaigns are shallow negative and uninformative and the debates should not be called debates because they are not about 5 billion is spent in each election cycle and the two main parties and politicians control the narrative resulting in an uninformed electorate the citizens united v fec case equates citizens and corporations for campaign contributions as free speech and politicians never debate the illogic of it nor the need to reverse it wages of the working class middle class have stagnated for about 40 years our healthcare system ranks last among 11 developed countries and yet costs more than any other our educational system does not rank in the top 20 in the world but costs the most schools are financed via property taxes resulting unequal education over a thousand of our municipal water systems are health hazards and our roads and bridges are crumbling voting machines and processes can be easily hacked and we ve known it for many years us military spending is roughly equal to the combined expenses of china saudi arabia united kingdom india france and japan the income wealth gap of americans is growing wider each year gerrymandering disenfranchises millions of voters because we allow partisanship in drawing the boundaries the electoral college instead of confirming the vote of americans can reject and nullify the popular vote but politicians ignore it american s confidence in the media justifiably or not has dangerously eroded teenagers are more enlightened and educated about climate change than the us congress taxpayers bailed out wall street about 10 years ago but congress did almost nothing for the average american victims of the corruption while doing nothing to those guilty of the corruption the us armed forces have a presence in about 150 countries monopolies have been allowed by governmental policy including the media pharmaceuticals telecommunications and banking to name a few that impact us the most it took about 200 years for the national debt to reach about 800 billion in 1980 it s now approximately 22 trillion about 27 times as much the us government estimates another 1 1 trillion will be added to the debt in 2019 and yet another 1 trillion in 2020 interest on the national debt is in the top five largest government expenditures the blueprint the foundation and guidance for this blueprint to recover democracy is this quote from james madison one of our founding fathers knowledge will forever govern ignorance and people who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power knowledge gives a popular government without popular information or the means of acquiring it is but a prologue to a farce or a tragedy or perhaps both here is how we reclaim our power and democracy by focusing on knowledge and information as mr madison advises and creating nonpartisan forums a diverse coalition of americans can recover the political system the us constitution empowers us to establish this blueprint for recovering our democracy and exercising our control is explained in the four pillars below implementing these pillars will be done on the state and local level all politics is local it will require a huge effort and a strong will are we willing to come together to make the effort and exercise our will is the crucial question the four pillars are one hour a week it is absurd and insulting that the politicians control every aspect of their communications with us but we the people can refuse to accept that we must demand one hour a week from political candidates and incumbents during which their philosophy beliefs values on a given topic health care for instance or gerrymandering will be discussed for up to one hour these one hour sessions will be planned and conducted by we neither the media nor the political parties will play a part in organizing and conducting these forums this will work for two reasons first grass roots candidates will have forums to realistically challenge incumbents recall the three goals of our coalition without raising millions of dollars second history shows us that if enough of we demand change we prevail discussing philosophy or values on a topic is inherently nonpartisan and non adversarial it is simply a matter of what they think and feel about an issue discussing their philosophy on a topic ensures that our forums are scrupulously nonpartisan and only endeavor to elicit knowledge and information for citizens to consider and act on as they choose if the forum discussions become partisan it gives politicians an excuse to not participate just as important partisan questions deter gaining real knowledge and information and are just another opportunity to repeat talking points or claim fake news we want knowledge and information not to challenge candidates on how they voted or what they previously said that would be a partisan challenge that challenge is for the mainstream media to follow up if their record conflicts with their views stated in our one hour discussion topic the demand on the politician s time is minimal surely they don t have to prepare to explain their philosophy on a topic politicians complain of spending 10 to 40 of the time fund raising so one hour a week is certainly not a time burden elected representatives cannot credibly claim they are responsive to constituents when we get so little of their time and only on their terms categorically whom do they spend their time with donors lobbyists rules for the one hour 1 the topic will be announced one week before the one hour discussion these forums are for education not trapping a politician 2 no leading questions leading questions suggest an answer and we want knowledge and information 3 must be a registered candidate for an office in accordance with legal filing requirements 4 no live audience these knowledge and information one hour sessions should not be interrupted by an audience and we do not want the politician playing to an audience 5 politicians may appear in person or videoconference 6 discussions will be televised ideally live or recorded and archived for public access panels who asks questions two people asking the questions and a moderator to ensure compliance with the rules seems practical but those details can be left to the local organizers since this will be implemented on the state and local level of course there are many qualified people able to appropriately ask the questions following the rules without training but the integrity of the weekly one hour discussion is crucial so that improper or poorly worded questions won t provide the politicians with a reason to not participate the moderator can facilitate forming questions properly if there is difficulty bar associations state and local could initially take the lead organizing these forums attorneys are trained to ask questions to get to the heart of an issue bar associations promote pro bono work from their membership as part of its giving back to society leading we the people to recover democracy would be saving american society the ultimate of giving back hopefully bar associations nationwide will consider this article a formal request to help initiate this organizational effort and lead we the people to create these forums tv network where will these discussion forums take place initially on the local pbs affiliates or the public access channels these forums would hopefully be temporary only for the 2020 election longer term we the people can raise the money to create a nationwide tv network devoted solely to conducting political campaigns and to hold office holders accountable via the weekly one hour discussions crowd funding a mere 5 00 from eligible voters will raise about 1 billion dollars until that ideal is realized pbs or even renting network tv studio time could suffice again this money is raised on the state and local level hopefully local tv stations could contribute studio time for nonpartisan educational forums but about 75 of the american media is owned by about six corporations so this is unlikely implementing the four pillars all this totally depends on the will of we the people to decide to do it this mechanism is exactly what the constitution envisions for we the people to use our power to re gain control when professional politicians and the policies they enact no longer serve americans there may be other methods to prevent professional politicians and their moneyed backers from taking control of america but if so no one is discussing them we can accomplish much of this for the 2020 election if we choose to certainly we can set the tone for the future and let it be known that we are no longer going to let the money control our political systems and structures there are many social and political movements already organized and functioning republicans democrats progressives independents metoo the 3 ers black lives matter the alt right make america great again the resistance and every other social and political movement can join forces and evolve and advance american politics if they can for this one ultimate pivotal issue set aside their differences and join together to exercise the power of we it will be an evolution of american politics a collateral benefit would be to give divided americans a common cause a reason to come together we may realize we actually agree on many basic issues which is validated by many polls each of these movements has its own agenda to promote what these movements can also do is add the demand for one hour a week from candidates and or officeholders in addition to their issue specific demands these movements will not have to finance anything and the time demand is minuscule it may be nothing more than carrying an additional demonstration sign that says one hour a week surely everyone regardless of politics can come together for a renewed political system that supports grass roots candidates so that a viable campaign can be orchestrated without millions of dollars we the people must act now for the 2020 election and demand one hour a week from all candidates most of course will refuse especially the professional politicians but if we begin now there is still plenty of time for grassroots candidates who would not otherwise decide to run in this toxic environment to become public servants imagine an actual grassroots candidate not chosen by a political party who only wants to give public service and will enthusiastically discusses her his philosophy for an hour once a week that sounds almost quaint by today s standards but they exist juxtapose that with the professional politician attacking and dividing with nothing more than shallow talking points six months of once a week on 26 topics by grassroots candidates cannot be ignored by the pros they would have to participate or lose elections if the concept of grassroots candidates seems remote it may be because we re jaded by our increasing political cynicism our forums will create a venue for a new type of candidate from the republican democrat progressive independent or other parties to present their philosophy and values they will no longer need the endorsement of a party will some of the grassroots candidates be superficial also of course but with one hour on a single topic their actual philosophy will emerge their demeanor and ability to articulate their beliefs will likewise emerge and that is the point one hour one topic once a week that is the knowledge and information mr madison had in mind as explained in pillar i philosophical questions are nonpartisan and this is crucial to forcing politicians participation while also hosting grass roots candidates in our forums any indication of partisanship from the panels or moderator could provide a reason to not participate politicians refusal to give a nonpartisan discussion hour could be interpreted as not wanting to reveal their true philosophy here are some sample questions that demonstrate how philosophical belief questions provide an understanding of both their knowledge and their character we gain knowledge and information just as mr madison advises 1 as a congressperson do you have a duty to ensure that your constituents are fully informed of your philosophy on the issues confronting america will you commit to one hour a week to fulfill that duty 2 is equal healthcare for all a human right if it is do the us or state governments have a role to ensure that right is fulfilled 3 using a pie chart how would you distribute the us budget among its various needs show it in percentages not dollar amounts x for military y for debt interest z for social programs and so on exclude social security since it is funded by separate ss taxes 4 does the federal government have a duty to address the ever widening income and wealth gap between rich and poor americans if so what can be done if there is no duty what can be done 5 what is your philosophy and practical application for using science in considering legislation 6 compare and contrast socialism and democratic socialism 7 what should the government do if anything to train or re train people for the current demands of employers 8 does gerrymandering by both parties support or negate democracy what can you we do each of us has a decision to make do we implement this blueprint do we take back control from the big money and professional politicians that are not creating a just and fair society for all of us do we continue to let a tiny minority dictate to us even though we have all the power and greatly outnumber any opposition or can we the people join together as americans and create an unstoppable movement in the pure pursuit of knowledge and information and nullify the obscene and corrosive amounts of money in politics that would be an evolution of american politics and our society more in keeping with our values you can introduce this concept into any groups of which you re a member encourage others to discuss this with you contact bar associations and ask for help form groups to strategize implementation engage people to think deeper discuss this blueprint with your political opposite encourage grassroots candidates or become one yourself to quote hillel the elder if not you who if not now when consider this the us constitution the emancipation proclamation women s suffrage and the voting rights act of 1965 were all deemed idealistic at the time and yet they became law those seminal events evolved americans individually and america as a country and a society we have an opportunity now to match the willpower behind those four evolutionary hallmarks of legislation america needs to take an evolutionary leap so our government s will create a society for all not just an economy for the few we can add to the list of movements of idealism that became realism the goal of one hour a week is an evolutionary leap in how americans conduct elections and hold politicians accountable in one sense the threat of plutocracy simply provided the opportunity for us think deeper about what the end result of our detachment 50 voting is going to render if we don t take action which will we the people decide democracy or not which will you decide democracy or not if we the people remain passive in the face of this challenge to democracy then we are probably right now presiding over a prologue to a farce or a tragedy or perhaps both that mr madison predicts

even though a bunch of us economic indicators are looking good and interest rates are low half of investment grade corporate bonds are just one notch above junk status this could be because levered us

two respected experts peter koenig and larry romanoff analyse the coronavirus outbreak and put it in its proper perspective shunning the us government and its vassal states campaign of deliberatearound this disease whose origin itself is highly problematic and perhaps political as larry romanoff puts it canada with a population about the same as shanghai has so far this flu season had more than 20 000 confirmed cases 2 200 hospitalisations and 85 deaths roughly the same as all of china with the new corona virus at the same time but there is no panic in canada about the flu and united airlines isn t cancelling all flights to canada by the same token for the us in this flu season there have been 140 000 hospitalisations and about 8 500 deaths but the flu barely rates a mention in the us media and the government is not shuttering cities or air travel peter koenig is an economist and geopolitical analyst he is also a water resources and environmental specialist he worked for over 30 years with the world bank and the world health organization around the world including in palestine in the fields of environment and water he lectures at universities in the us europe and south america he writes regularly for global research ich rt sputnik presstv the 21st century greanville post defend democracy press telesur the saker blog the new eastern outlook neo and other internet sites he is the author of implosion an economic thriller about war environmental destruction and corporate greed fiction based on facts and on 30 years of world bank experience around the globe he is also a co author of the world order and revolution essays from the resistance peter koenig is a research associate of the centre for research on globalization while preparing for the worst because washington with the help of its level 4 bio war lab will not let go easily china s approach of endless inventive creation avoiding conflicts will outlive the aggressor remember the spanish flu pandemic of 1918 the deadliest in history infected an estimated 500 million people worldwide at that time about one third of the planet s population and killed at least 50 million people a death rate of 10 including some 700 000 americans this new coronavirus 2019 ncov may just be a trial imagine a stronger mutation of a coronavirus would be implanted into the chinese population say with a mortality rate of 10 to 20 or higher it could cause real havoc however a stronger version may not be so easily controllable and directable i e towards the chinese race and may risk spreading to the caucasian race as well meaning the executioner would risk committing mass suicide but that and the constant bashing with negative western propaganda travel bans border closures flight bans and more plus the disease itself the medical care work absenteeism medication and medical equipment not to forget the specially built 1 000 bed emergency hospital in wuhan and an 8 average decline at the shanghai stock exchange bear a considerable economic cost for china so much so that the people s bank of china pbc has recently injected some 1 2 billion yuan about us 174 million equivalent into the economy to prevent that from happening washington is doing everything possible to destabilize china see hong kong taiwan the uyghurs in china s western xinjiang province tibet the infamous trump inspired tariff war and now the new coronavirus outbreak the death toll is at present about 2 1 of total cases of infection down from 2 3 a week ago china s currency the yuan is also advancing rapidly as a reserve currency gradually replacing the us dollar when that happens that real money like the chinese yuan based on a hard economy and covered by gold against a fake fiat currency based on nothing like the us dollar is taking the lead then the us dollar hegemony is broken and the us economy doomed the west s demolition priority seems to have shifted drastically from russia to china why because china is an ever stronger economic power soon to surpass the united states in absolute terms since mid 2017 china is already number one measured by the ppp purchasing power parity indicator indeed the most important one because it demonstrates what people can actually buy with the money it sounds like a strange coincidence that in october 2019 a simulation with precisely the coronavirus was carried out at the john hopkins institute in the us funded by the bill and melinda gates foundation the wef world economic forum as well as the pirbright institute of the uk one of the world s few level 4 highest security level bio warfare laboratories for more details see china s coronavirus a global health emergency is launched what are the facts in china where by now scientific evidence is mounting that the disease like all the coronaviral diseases including the 2019 ncov predecessor sars severe acute respiratory syndrome 2002 2003 also in china and its middle east equivalent mers middle east respiratory syndrome are not only laboratory fabricated but also patented and so are many others for example ebola and hiv both sars and 2019 ncov are not only man made but they are also focusing on the chinese race that s why you find very few people infected in the 18 countries where the coronavirus has spread quarantine is absolutely not necessary chinese biologists of the office of science and technology of the city of wuxi south eastern jiangsu province near shanghai have developed a test kit that can detect the 2019 ncov virus within 8 15 minutes similar to a pregnancy test this test kit is available to the world in fact it has been used to test an airline crew member arriving from new york at the zurich airport and feeling ill within less than an hour the crew member was sent home it was the common flu yet china bashing in one way or another seems to intensify by the day yesterday 3 february the un in geneva has issued an edict that all un employees returning from china must stay home and work from home for 14 days i e a dictated self quarantine and new contracts for chinese staff will be temporarily suspended this is all propaganda against china expand these statistics to europe and you find similar figures of course nobody talks about it this is an annual occurrence a bonanza for the western pharma industry in the west disease is business the more the merrier once you are in the medical mill it s difficult to escape specialists find always another reason to send you yet to another specialist for another treatment the ignorant patient has no option than to obey after all its his health and life in china it is the total opposite the chinese system does everything for its population s health and well being yet this 2019 2020 flu season which is far from over has so far claimed more than 8 400 lives alone in the us more than 140 000 hospitalizations and more than 8 million infected people the us has about 330 million people compare this to china s 1 4 billion population with as of 3 february an infection rate of less than 21 000 a death toll of 425 in china and outside of china reported two one in hong kong another one in the philippines the nyt and washpo are on a vicious daily campaign to slander and vilify china with lies and manipulated information on how badly china is managing the disease when the complete opposite is the case compare this to the common flu epidemic that hits the us and most of the western countries despite the fact that the us and europe have virtually implemented carpet vaccination in some us states and eu countries even compulsory russia also closed her 4 200 km long border working hand in hand with china in containing the virus this also means that no infected russian citizen may leave china this is a concerted chinese russian effort spearheaded by china to control and contain the epidemic nevertheless and against who s guidance washington immediately advised its citizens not to travel to china and withdrew non essential staff from us consulates and the embassy in beijing thereby triggering an avalanche of similar reactions among washington vassals around the globe i e most of the european countries did likewise many of them canceled their flights to china as did of course the us in fact dr tedros has himself as well as other high ranking who officials on various occasions praised china for her effort to contain the virus the speed with which wuhan population of 11 million capital of the center eastern province of hubei and china as a whole has reacted to the outbreak the latest achievement in 8 days china has built in wuhan a 25 000 m2 special hospital for treatment of the coronavirus 2019 ncov and possible mutations with 1 000 beds and for about 1 400 medical personnel for a budget of the equivalent of us 43 million equipped with state of the art medical technology no other country in the world would have been capable of such an achievement on 29 january who director general dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus said that there was no reason to declare the outbreak of the coronavirus 2019 ncov in china a pandemic risk on 30 january he declared the virus an international emergency but made clear that there was no reason for countries to issue travel advisories against travelling to china let me speculate the international emergency was declared at the request of washington and the comment against the travel advisory was an addition by dr tedros himself as he realized that there was indeed no reason for panic that china is doing wonders in stemming the virus from spreading and in detecting the virus early on while this coronavirus is indeed serious and is causing deaths one wonders if the responses especially in the west are reaching out of control canada with a population about the same as shanghai has so far this flu season had more than 20 000 confirmed cases 2 200 hospitalisations and 85 deaths roughly the same as all of china with the new corona virus at the same time but there is no panic in canada about the flu and united airlines isn t cancelling all flights to canada by the same token for the us in this flu season there have been 140 000 hospitalisations and about 8 500 deaths but the flu barely rates a mention in the us media and the government is not shuttering cities or air travel even more in 2017 the us recorded 61 000 fatalities from the flu with 45 million becoming very ill yet there was no national emergency cited and life remained normal 1 infection history december 31 2019 january 31 2019 december 31 1 january 03 44 january 21 225 january 23 830 january 24 1 295 january 25 1 950 january 26 2 744 infections 80 deaths january 27 4 515 infections 105 deaths january 28 5 974 infections 132 deaths january 29 7 711 infections 170 deaths january 30 9 692 infections 216 deaths january 31 9 800 infections 216 deaths source chinese government and world health organization data see map below sofar all recorded deaths are in mainland china not a single death has been recorded outside china these numbers are low when compared to those pertaining to the common seasonal virus flu outbreak according to who data there were 5 million infections and 650 000 deaths worldwide associated with the common seasonal flu virus 2017 figures in hong kong there are more deaths every two weeks from the regular flu each year and this year than occurred with sars in total but with only 6 confirmed coronavirus cases hong kong is shutting down most flights and trains between the mainland and has closed many of its border ports of entry in mainland china the new virus has now caused more infections than did sars during 2002 2003 although the death rate is much lower but 200 or 300 deaths in a population of nearly 1 4 billion is not immediately reminiscent of the plague or the spanish flu both of which caused millions of deaths around the world and indeed china as well experiences many more deaths from the simple flu each year yet china has allocated nearly 30 billion rmb about us 4 billion to support the battle against this novel coronavirus the fear and the over reaction if indeed it is such appear to stem simply from the fact that this pathogen is new train travel during this holiday was down by about 75 from the same period last year china extended the country s new year holiday in an attempt to permit citizens to remain isolated at their homes for a longer period but there will soon be a large wave of travelers returning to their place of residence or work with the dangers of further infections airlines from numerous countries announced the reduction or full cancellation of all flights to china and russia mongolia and north korea blocked all crossings into china until march 1 russia effectively closing its 4 200 km border the us and many other nations have recommended the avoidance of any travel to china as well many businesses in china have elected to temporarily close their doors including starbucks and mcdonald s ikea and others 2 the italian government declared a state of emergency in an effort to allegedly prevent the spread of the coronavirus strain after two cases were confirmed in rome italy air france delta airlines air canada british airways lion air and seoul air finnair cathay pacific and jetstar asia have suspended all flights to and from china several other airlines including were reducing the number of flights to the country as demand for travel drops many nations have now evacuated most of their diplomatic staff from china including the us france and japan australia said it would quarantine suspected infections for two weeks on a small island about 1 600 kms from its mainland and singapore has barred all travelers who have visited mainland china during the past two weeks 3 elsewhere more than 6 000 tourists were under lockdown aboard a cruise ship at an italian port on thursday after two chinese passengers from macao were isolated over fears they could be carrying the coronavirus 4 the who declared a global emergency on january 30 the who declared the virus outbreak as a global emergency an extraordinary event that constitutes a risk to other countries and requires a coordinated international response this was prompted by the rapid rise in reported infections especially having spread to 18 other nations where there were cases of human to human transmission france confirmed that a doctor who was in contact with a patient with the new virus later became infected himself and medical specialists worry that the spread of new viruses from patients to health workers can signal the virus is becoming adapted to human transmission and thus become much more infectious 5 the who director general said the declaration was not a vote of non confidence in china nor what was happening in china but because of what is happening in other countries and that our greatest concern is the potential for this virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems which are ill prepared to deal with it marion koopmans an infectious diseases specialist at erasmus university medical center in the netherlands and a member of who s emergency committee wondered if the virus was more infectious than previously thought or if there was something unusual in those circumstances another virologist suggested the transmission was easier than initially assumed stating that if transmission between humans was difficult then the numbers would have plateaued another medical officer stated that this new virus has spread at unprecedented scale and speed with cases passing between people in multiple countries across the world there were western media reports that wuhan medical authorities had been arrested for breaking the news about the virus but those claims were not true what did happen was that some unrelated individuals circulated online comments that sars had returned to china and had been detected in wuhan s hospitals which claim rattled a great many people the police did interview them because spreading unfounded or false rumors that upset public stability is a crime in china however these 8 individuals were released and later commended because their evidence proved to be essentially correct even though as the chief epidemiologist at the ccdc stated they lacked scientific evidence in fact china s supreme court issued a statement on this saying facts show that although the novel coronavirus infected pneumonia was not sars information released by the eight people was not entirely fabricated 6 in a surprising move the mayor of wuhan zhou xianwang said that the public were initially unsatisfied with the speed of information disclosure and that the rapid effective lockdown of the city was upsetting to many people he said i hope the public can understand that it s an infectious disease and it s unprecedented to lockdown a city with more than 10 million people however faced with the current situation we ve closed the city gate and possibly besieged the virus within the city we might leave a bad name in history he then stated but if it s conducive to the control of the virus and the protection of the safety of the people both he and the party chief in wuhan would resign if that would appease any existing indignation 7 typically hong kong s south china morning post an anti mainland publication twisted the story to read wuhan mayor under pressure to resign over response to virus when in fact there was no outside pressure 8 it was heartwarming that privately owned chinese hotels in wuhan voluntarily provided free rooms for medical staff needing rest xiao yaxing the private owner of a four star hotel in the city opened a discussion group on chinese social media platform wechat where he appealed to his peers from more than 40 hotels to offer rooms for doctors and nurses who were working day and night to save lives he said that since nearly all transportation had ceased in the large city it was difficult for the medical staff to get to hospitals from home and needed rest places as well xiao said many hotels in wuhan are shut down for travelers leaving a lot of empty rooms that we can offer for free 9 china s state owned enterprises also mobilised their resources to combat the outbreak of pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus the nation s major telecom operators initiated emergency responses to ensure effective communications in hubei province and soe pharma companies have made extreme efforts to accelerate production of test kits and medical appliances as well as working around the clock to develop vaccines against the virus 10 and of course every silver lining has a cloud retail giants carrefour and wal mart are being fined millions of rmb for illegal price gouging profiteering frauds and otherwise cheating their customers during this crisis both having apparently been warned in advance only a few days prior by the authorities and both firms ignoring the warnings it must be said that both carrefour and especially wal mart have a long history in china of various kinds of fraudulent practices a few years ago all the wal mart stores in chongqing province were shuttered and six top executives arrested for a massive public fraud with the company receiving a heavy fine 11 as an example in this instance one branch alone of carrefour in shanghai had taken advantage of the public anxiety to mark up their regular vegetable prices from for example 2 5 rmb to 19 8 from 3 87 to 19 55 and from 4 26 to 18 33 while their procurement costs had remained stable the authorities discovered that both carrefour and wal mart had been further cheating customers with false prices or misleading tags but charging 30 to 50 more at the check out these price frauds occurred in many stores in many provinces by both firms 12 carrefour china apologized for any pricing irregularities and said the company would establish a special control group to conduct internal price quality inspections wal mart for its part also issued a statement saying it would strengthen efforts on price inspections and treat any problems extremely seriously however these are the same statements these two companies make each time they are caught and fined for fraudulent practices 13 some troubling background each of these items below and indeed all of them together might be dismissed as mere coincidences it is too early to form conclusions but these facts and events have startled and alarmed some people from their topical relevance and their correspondence in terms of time part of the unsettling nature of these events is that many tragedies in the world in recent times have had trial runs with the authorities conducting simulated events that uncannily resembled the real event which took place shortly afterward the boston marathon bombing in the us a few years ago was one such event where hundreds of citizens testified that what appeared to be fbi agents carried out precisely such a simulation only days before the actual bombing took place there are many such and all well documented though the mass media avoided all discussion of them chinese officials initially believed the virus originated at the huanan seafood wholesale market in wuhan but say it now appears now that there were multiple sources of the infection huang chaolin a chinese pulmonary disease specialist vice director of wuhan jinyintan hospital revealed some early findings on the clinical data of the first 41 novel coronavirus cases in a new published paper in the lancet he said that four of the first five cases had no contact with the seafood market and that only 27 of the first 41 cases had such exposure judging from the whole situation the seafood market may not be the only source the origin of the novel coronavirus might be multi source 14 while a few caucasians and other asians have been infected to date the virus so far appears to still be tightly focused to chinese in my previous article on this virus i referred to a thesis on biological weapons by leonard horowitz and zygmunt dembek who stated that clear signs of a genetically engineered bio warfare agent were 1 a disease caused by an uncommon unusual rare or unique agent with 2 lack of an epidemiological explanation i e no clear idea of source 3 an unusual manifestation and or geographic distribution such as race specificity and 4 multiple sources of infection this case now has all four 15 there is another matter involving racial susceptibility to this 2019 ncov infection disease a group of chinese virologists discovered that at least some chinese have an extremely large number of a particular kind of cell in their lungs which relate to regulating both viral reproduction and transmission they claimed this as the appropriate biological background for the epidemic investigation of the 2019 ncov 16 17 another strange occurrence was around two years ago when the us air force placed a listing on the federal business opportunities website asking for at least 12 rna samples from russian people of a european ancestry as well as 27 samples of russian synovial fluid the contract stated that all samples must be collected from russia and must be caucasian the government will not consider tissue samples from ukraine 18 igor nikulin a former member of the un commission on biological weapons noted that the rna samples can be used to develop viruses new types of biological weapons are being developed there s nothing else that could possibly interest the military department most likely they are weaponised viruses the us is trying to develop various types of biological weapons specifically for specific carriers of this gene pool and caucasoids are needed since they constitute the majority of the population of our country this is the same focus group for which they are trying to find the samples it s necessary for the viruses to act selectively on one or another ethnic group wuhan was holding the world military games just a few weeks prior to the outbreak of the virus with a huge foreign contingent present 300 us military personnel arrived in wuhan for these games which lasted into november not long before the infections began there is no proven link between these two but merely questions which arise from the timing 19 20 in october of 2019 the bill and melinda gates foundation co hosted a pandemic exercise with the johns hopkins center for health security in conjunction with the uk s pirbright institute using precisely such a novel corona virus outbreak it was called event 201 and was a simulation exercise that envisioned a fast spreading coronavirus with a devastating impact in their simulation the coronavirus resulted in a death toll of 65 million people within 18 months surpassing the deadliest pandemic in history the 1918 spanish flu 21 screenshot event 201 the organisers were saying efforts to prevent such consequences or respond to them as they unfold will require unprecedented levels of collaboration between governments international organizations and the private sector in their narrative the immune resistant virus was crippling trade and travel sending the global economy into freefall social media was rampant with rumors and misinformation governments were collapsing and citizens were revolting they claimed this scenario was utterly realistic aside from the coincidence with a virtually identical breakout in china perhaps the most revealing part was the group s focus on the necessity of deep coordination with the private sector because in their words vaccine development is slow and difficult if there isn t an immediate market for it comments of this kind unfortunately raise immediate questions another serious matter is the pirbright institute itself which assisted in the above simulation the pirbright institute is one of the uk s two major bio weapons labs the other being porton down it was from pirbright that foot and mouth disease viruses escaped twice in recent years devastating the small farmers by killing all the cattle and that resulted in uk farming suddenly being taken over by big agra this so called institute has what must surely be the worst record of safety of ethics and of story telling ability among the entire world s level 4 biolabs for background a level 4 lab is perhaps the most secure place on earth no unauthorised person can even approach much less enter and an exit requires among other things stripping naked for decontamination nothing no materials can be removed from the site for obvious reasons without a police or military escort however when the foot and mouth disease ravaged england and the source was definitively traced to pirbright their response was that animal activists had entered the lab and stolen some vials of pathogens and released them the great majority of english unfamiliar with the technical features of biolabs probably believed the story which was pure fantasy a related issue is that pirbright s presence at the simulation was no doubt due to the fact that they have created and patented several five i believe coronaviruses one of which was used in the simulation us patent 10 130 701 issued november 20 2018 it is curious that pirbright is partially funded by the gates foundation a primary funder leading one to wonder why bill gates would be financing a uk bioweapons lab we are told the interest is in vaccines but a biolab that creates and patents lethal pathogens could avoid the cost of vaccine research by not creating the pathogens in the first instance pirbright own the patents for five different new kinds of corona viruses but have also created and patented a wide range of other pathogens including with funding from gates engineered mosquito genes weaponising insects in fact which some believe was the original source of oxytech s mosquitoes that released the zika virus 22 23 then in late january netflix released a new documentary called pandemic how to prevent an outbreak which alarmed many people with the coincidence of it being released just as the coronavirus is spreading worldwide some dismissed this as an elaborate publicity stunt but its contents are too detailed and too linked to china s coronavirus to be an accident the series examines the worldwide healthcare system discussed possible sources of viruses that could cause a worldwide pandemic and examines humanity s ability to cope given that the documentary required some time for production many worried citizens on the internet are asking if netflix had prior knowledge it is an alarmist documentary encouraging the public to be most scared of influenza and respiratory corona viruses with phrases like pandemic is now seek don t hide prayers might work it too focuses on the private sector as the world s savior with privately produced and for profit vaccines 24 25 26 in another disparaging article cnn claims historically a mass quarantine is an aggressive response that s far from perfect in the past it has led to political financial and social consequences lawrence gostin a professor of global health law at georgetown university and director of the who s center on global health law said the move was unprecedented and he thought very unwise nothing on this scale has ever been tried he told cnn there s very little evidence of its effectiveness and i think there s good reason to think that it could backfire from a public health social human rights perspective cnn claims they can lead to logistical issues that merely the word quarantine will cause panic and hysteria apparently there are also human rights implications one us expert stating i don t think you can enforce a mass quarantine of 30 million people without violating human rights the same expert claimed it could easily spur public violence and a distrust of health authorities and that there will be broad financial and social consequences and will hinder local economic activity gostin then claimed that getting the buy in from the people you re protecting is essential he said and always better than ordering people to do stuff it would seem that for china you are damned if you do and damned if you don t 27 other media and internet posters regularly insinuate or claim that the new coronavirus leaked from the wuhan bio weapons lab yet another example of writers making claims while lacking any close personal acquaintance with the facts the university of wuhan contains the wuhan institute of virology which is one of the country s premier biosafety laboratories which works with the who and other international groups as part of a large network studying pathogens from all over the world as do all other such institutes i have seen many insinuations or accusations of the institute being a bio weapons lab but those are claims made with no supporting evidence i am generally aware of the institute and it is purely a civilian operation it has never been associated with biological military or combat research note to readers please click the share buttons above or below forward this

trump who is seeking a second term in office in the nov 3 election but the biggest downgrade to payrolls over a 12 month period since 2009 showed the labor market was not as robust as the republican president has boasted strong job creation in january provided reassurance that the record long economic expansion still has room to run said lydia boussour a senior u s economist at oxford economics in new york but this latest health report also points to a maturing labor market with benchmark revisions showing it isn t as youthful as it has pretended to be over the last two years advertisement nonfarm payrolls increased by 225 000 jobs last month with employment at construction sites increasing by the most in a year amid milder than normal temperatures the government s survey of establishments showed there were also strong gains in hiring in the transportation and warehousing industry economists polled by reuters had forecast payrolls would rise by 160 000 jobs in january some said the unusually warm weather was likely throwing off the model the government uses to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data juicing the numbers with the coronavirus hitting the chinese economy hard u s payrolls growth could slow in the coming months advertisement the federal reserve on friday flagged the coronavirus as a risk to the u s economy until it is clear that the hiring was due to an upward shift in the overall economic growth rate we have to assume that there are weaker numbers coming sometime during the next few months said joel naroff chief economist at naroff economic advisors in holland pennsylvania advertisement the economy grew 2 3 in 2019 the slowest performance in three years after logging 2 9 growth in 2018 growth this year is seen around 2 the

unemployment rate rises economists said the size of the benchmark revisions which showed substantial downgrades to manufacturing employment from august through december 2018 suggested the government

retreated from record highs as investors focused on the benchmark revisions the dollar traded higher against a basket of currencies while prices of u s treasuries rose advertisement economists said the report supported the fed s desire to keep interest rates unchanged this year the government also introduced updated population estimates to its smaller household survey data the unemployment rate is calculated from the household survey the labor force participation rate or the proportion of working age americans who have a job or are looking for one rose two tenths of a percentage point to 63 4 last month the highest since june 2013 as a result the jobless rate rose to 3 6 from 3 5 in december advertisement economists said the higher participation rate if sustained suggests the economy needs to create about 130 000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working age population instead of the 100 000 estimated by fed officials despite the downward pressure from an aging

middle east tension spurs gold demand as flight to safe haven pushes price to a 7 year high the gold market s sweet spot is at the beginning of the year according to bloomberg analysts mike mcglone a commodity strategist at bloomberg intelligence says january has historically proved to be the best month to buy gold the yellow metal s prices have consequently gained ground at an average rate of 2 7 for the last two decades during this period generally gold prices surge in the first few months of the year prices then cool down through the spring and summer months and then rise again in the fall january therefore is regarded as the best time to invest in the yellow metal mcglone suggests that the metal could hit february highs of 1 600 should its past five years average increase persist true to mcglone s words january 2020 has witnessed increased bullish buying of gold as a result bullion has attained its highest prices since its september 2019 rise since the beginning of the year the metal has rallied by over 1 6 reaching highs of 1 553 an ounce setting a new six year high this rise however has been largely attributed to the us forces airstrike that brought down iran s qasem soleimani the iranian general was regarded as one of the most powerful men in the country general soleimani was the head of the quds force an elite iranian military unit us president donald trump took responsibility for the attack carried out on soleimani at baghdad airport the iranian military operations leader died alongside some other militia figures backed by his country us we preempted soleimani attacks defending his decision us president donald trump said the general was directly and indirectly responsible for the deaths of millions of people the january 3 airstrike therefore escalated tensions between the middle eastern nation and washington as an illustration ayatollah ali khamenei the country s supreme leader publicly declared severe revenge for the us terming the act as criminal he also proclaimed a three day long national mourning event for the slain general the general who led the iranian revolutionary guards elite unit the quds force was said to be the second most influential military figure in the country after the ayatollah washington has said that the attack was preempting future iranian attack plans the effect of the attack on commodities trading was instant global oil prices for instance soared by over 4 in the attack s wake with iranian officials terming the airstrike as an act of war that warranted harsh retaliation it ushered the already shaky world economy into a new but more dangerous chapter iranian president hassan rouhani said that his country and other like minded regional free nations would avenge the death of the general he also vowed to stand against america s bullying russia iraq and lebanon have openly supported iran s vengeful stance with russia terming the airstrike as a reckless step and murder gold prices are highly affected by geopolitics gold is a haven asset that has proven to perform exceedingly well in seasons of political and economic uncertainties according to jeffrey currie the goldman sachs commodities research global head geopolitics play an essential role in the performance of the gold market currie notes that gold performed well even controlling for real rates and dollar weakness during the beginning of both gulf wars and during the events of september 11 2001 it is for this reason that commodity strategists at goldman sachs have pointed to gold as a more robust hedge than oil for any investor seeking safety in returns as the tensions between tehran and washington escalate the markets for both oil and gold have risen after the baghdad airstrike as retaliation looms while brent prices have seen an upswing the rise is a sign that an oil supply disruption is imminent analysts from goldman however say that only an actual interruption in supply can sustain the surge in oil prices in contrast as per gold s history goldman says that the precious metal should rally beyond its current prices oil prices are currently at the highest they have been since september s attacks on two saudi arabian oil facilities analysts at goldman are projecting a downswing in crude oil prices in the next few weeks despite an over 1 25 rise after the attack on soleimani on its part gold rallied by over 100 an ounce and could soon exceed goldman s 2020 price prediction of 1 600 per ounce gold experienced choppy water in 2018 thanks to a relatively strong us dollar but 2019 turned the precious metal s fortunes around in september 2018 the fed hiked its rates upping its anticipation for the us economic growth in 2019 it was the fed s third increase in rates in a year and the eighth since the regulator s 2015 rate normalization policy started as a result the us had its highest rates in a decade the head of metals research strategy at j p morgan then noted that as long as the inverse equities bonds correlation holds the gold price will continue to be dictated by the direction of real yields and the us dollar gold therefore being sensitive to the high interest fed rates and a strong dollar was expensive especially for buyers that use other currencies the us bond yields were also more attractive and hence more preferred to non yielding precious metals gold s rally in 2019 in 2019 the fed s stance turned dovish heralding a new era for precious metals the fed began to ease the rates and the inverted yield curve showed up in financial charts the us and china trade wars coupled with the brexit debate and cooling global economic growth made gold a preferred investment asset ben bernanke has said that nobody really understands gold prices but history shows that geopolitics is a good driver of precious metals market excellence for this reason gold has not only seen an upsurge in demand among individual investors but also among central banks and major institutional investors the demand among investors has quickly escalated as central banks around the world lower their rates in what is viewed as a worldwide currency degradation attempt the fed has continuously been on us president donald trump s abuse radar as he has been a vocal supporter of low interest rates as a tool for global export market competitiveness the weak dollar environment weak economic growth data and rising inflation were the factors that goldman used to give its 1 600 an ounce of gold price prediction for 2020 goldman s jeffrey currie says that the firm is still bullish that the metal will hit this three month price prediction target citigroup in 2019 also issued a 2 000 ounce price prediction for gold in a year or two there were more bullish predictions for the price of gold come 2020 which should be easier to actualize now with the ongoing events in iran globally investors are falling back to gold and other safe haven assets as iran vows to abandon its uranium enrichment restrictions the nuclear deal negotiated by the obama administration would have seen the middle eastern country not only convert but also redesign and reduce its nuclear investments in return the state would have had the economic sanctions slapped on it for its nuclear related activities lifted which would free up billions of dollars in frozen assets and oil revenue donald trump has said that his administration had identified at least 52 sites in iran that would be bombed should iran attack us citizens or assets for this reason investors have been in a mad dash to sell stocks pushing their money to traditional safe bets julius baer s carsten menke nevertheless warns that the gold market needs more drivers than geopolitics to have a lasting impact this fact means that its prices will only reach higher peaks if more economic and financial instabilities arise to learn more about novem visit join the discussion in our telegram channels and follow our progress on social
on january 12 2010 an earthquake of magnitude 7 3 on the richter scale ripped through port au prince metropolitan area and other parts of haiti more than 1 5 million people representing 15 per cent of the country s population were directly affected by the earthquake according to the haitian government 316 000 people lost their lives an estimated us 7 8 billion dollars of damage was caused equivalent to more than 120 per cent of the gdp gdp gross domestic product gross domestic product is an aggregate measure of total production within a given territory equal to the sum of the gross values added the measure is notoriously incomplete for example it does not take into account any activity that does not enter into a commercial exchange the gdp takes into account both the production of goods and the production of services economic growth is defined as the variation of the gdp from one period to another of 2009 everyone in haiti has a story that begins or ends on 12 january and many wounds remain open everyone lost someone everyone remembers where they were that day from debt relief to oil debt when the earthquake struck i was with a group of european debt activists gathered by eurodad in a debt strategy meeting in brussels we reached out to our colleagues from papda haitian platform for an alternative development with whom we d been campaigning for the abolition of former haitian president duvalier s odious debt odious debt according to the doctrine for a debt to be odious it must meet two conditions 1 it must have been contracted against the interests of the nation or against the interests of the people or against the interests of the state 2 creditors cannot prove they they were unaware of how the borrowed money would be used we must underline that according to the doctrine of odious debt the nature of the borrowing regime or government does not signify since what matters is what the debt is used for if a democratic government gets into debt against the interests of its population the contracted debt can be called odious if it also meets the second condition consequently contrary to a misleading version of the doctrine odious debt is not only about dictatorial regimes see éric toussaint the doctrine of odious debt from alexander sack to the cadtm the father of the odious debt doctrine alexander nahum sack clearly says that odious debts can be contracted by any regular government sack considers that a debt that is regularly incurred by a regular government can be branded as odious if the two above mentioned conditions are met he adds once these two points are established the burden of proof that the funds were used for the general or special needs of the state and were not of an odious character would be upon the creditors sack defines a regular government as follows by a regular government is to be understood the supreme power that effectively exists within the limits of a given territory whether that government be monarchical absolute or limited or republican whether it functions by the grace of god or the will of the people whether it express the will of the people or not of all the people or only of some whether it be legally established or not etc none of that is relevant to the problem we are concerned with so clearly for sack all regular governments whether despotic or democratic in one guise or another can incur odious debts and recovery of stolen assets we quickly organised a solidarity campaign for debt relief for haiti we took the chance to explain why debt relief was not only a matter of solidarity but one of justice as haiti had been suffering from international interference and a legacy of odious debts since its independence this included unjust and harmful conditionality from imf imf international monetary fund along with the world bank the imf was founded on the day the bretton woods agreements were signed its first mission was to support the new system of standard exchange rates when the bretton wood fixed rates system came to an end in 1971 the main function of the imf became that of being both policeman and fireman for global capital it acts as policeman when it enforces its structural adjustment policies and as fireman when it steps in to help out governments in risk of defaulting on debt repayments as for the world bank a weighted voting system operates depending on the amount paid as contribution by each member state 85 of the votes is required to modify the imf charter which means that the usa with 17 68 of the votes has a de facto veto on any change the institution is dominated by five countries the united states 16 74 japan 6 23 germany 5 81 france 4 29 and the uk 4 29 the other 183 member countries are divided into groups led by one country the most important one 6 57 of the votes is led by belgium the least important group of countries 1 55 of the votes is led by gabon and brings together african countries and world bank world bank wb the world bank was founded as part of the new international monetary system set up at bretton woods in 1944 its capital is provided by member states contributions and loans on the international money markets it financed public and private projects in third world and east european countries it consists of several closely associated institutions among which 1 the international bank for reconstruction and development ibrd 189 members in 2017 which provides loans in productive sectors such as farming or energy 2 the international development association ida 159 members in 1997 which provides less advanced countries with long term loans 35 40 years at very low interest 1 3 the international finance corporation ifc which provides both loan and equity finance for business ventures in developing countries as third world debt gets worse the world bank along with the imf tends to adopt a macro economic perspective for instance it enforces adjustment policies that are intended to balance heavily indebted countries payments the world bank advises those countries that have to undergo the imf s therapy on such matters as how to reduce budget deficits round up savings enduce foreign investors to settle within their borders or free prices and exchange rates loans ultimately haiti received debt relief before and after the earthquake under the hipc heavily indebted poor countries hipc in 1996 the imf and the world bank launched an initiative aimed at reducing the debt burden for some 41 heavily indebted poor countries hipc whose total debts amount to about 10 of the third world debt the list includes 33 countries in sub saharan africa the idea at the back of the initiative is as follows a country on the hipc list can start an sap programme of twice three years at the end of the first stage first three years imf experts assess the sustainability of the country s debt from medium term projections of the country s balance of payments and of the net present value npv of debt to exports ratio if the country s debt is considered unsustainable it is eligible for a second stage of reforms at the end of which its debt is made sustainable that it it is given the financial means necessary to pay back the amounts due three years after the beginning of the initiative only four countries had been deemed eligible for a very slight debt relief uganda bolivia burkina faso and mozambique confronted with such poor results and with the jubilee 2000 campaign which brought in a petition with over 17 million signatures to the g7 meeting in cologne in june 1999 the g7 group of 7 most industrialised countries and international financial institutions launched an enhanced initiative sustainability criteria have been revised for instance the value of the debt must only amount to 150 of export revenues instead of 200 250 as was the case before the second stage in the reforms is not fixed any more an assiduous pupil can anticipate and be granted debt relief earlier and thirdly some interim relief can be granted after the first three years of reform simultaneously the imf and the world bank change their vocabulary their loans which so far had been called enhanced structural adjustment facilities esaf are now called growth and poverty reduction facilities gprf while structural adjustment policies are now called poverty reduction strategy paper this paper is drafted by the country requesting assistance with the help of the imf and the world bank and the participation of representatives from the civil society this enhanced initiative has been largely publicised the international media announced a 90 even a 100 cancellation after the euro african summit in cairo april 2000 yet on closer examination the hipc initiative turns out to be yet another delusive manoeuvre which suggests but in no way implements a cancellation of the debt list of the 42 heavily indebted poor countries angola benin bolivia burkina faso burundi cameroon central african republic chad comoro islands congo ivory coast democratic republic of congo ethiopia gambia ghana guinea guinea bissau guyana honduras kenya laos liberia madagascar malawi mali mauritania mozambique myanmar nicaragua niger rwanda sao tome and principe senegal sierra leone somalia sudan tanzania togo uganda vietnam zambia and mdri processes1 and in some cases this was topped up with additional cancellations of bilateral debt from venezuela france italy norway and finland external public debt stocks were reduced by 60 per cent reaching a minimum of us 775 million however debt service debt service the sum of the interests and the amortization of the capital borrowed remained a challenge as haiti had and still has one of the lowest domestic resource mobilisation rates in the western hemisphere according to the world bank at just 14 percent of gdp domestic tax revenues finance less than three quarters of total public spending 2018 external public debt also increased further due to the petrocaribe program with venezuela under this scheme the haitian government could purchase oil from venezuela at 60 of the price deferring the rest as debt which incurred one per cent interest interest an amount paid in remuneration of an investment or received by a lender interest is calculated on the amount of the capital invested or borrowed the duration of the operation and the rate that has been set over 25 years the haitian government was supposed to use the revenue for development projects however much of the money disappeared through corruption which led to massive demonstrations in 2018 at the same time following the recommendations of the imf the haitian government reduced fuel subsidies resulting in drastic price hikes of up to 51 per cent in march 2019 the haitian government secured a new imf loan of us 299 million which included further conditionalities on deficit reduction external public debt is now higher than before the hipc mdri debt relief reaching us 2 21 billion in 2018 increasing debt service four times higher than in 2011 decreasing donor support and a low capacity to generate revenue has placed the haitian government in deadlock not being able to pay even the most basic bills such as electricity from disaster aid to aid disaster along with debt relief donors from around the world pledged massive amounts of humanitarian and reconstruction aid thousands of humanitarian workers were deployed to haiti and ngos raised more than us 3 billion within a year of the disaster additionally governments and multilateral agencies promised us 13 34 billion for the 2010 2020 period unfortunately the office of the special envoy to haiti who kept track of disbursements ended its surveillance in 2012 at that time only 48 2 per cent of what was promised had been disbursed a total of us 6 43 billion since then it has proved difficult to ascertain how much of the total pledged has actually been disbursed according to the world bank the total official development assistance oda official development assistance official development assistance is the name given to loans granted in financially favourable conditions by the public bodies of the industrialized countries a loan has only to be agreed at a lower rate of interest than going market rates a concessionary loan to be considered as aid even if it is then repaid to the last cent by the borrowing country tied bilateral loans which oblige the borrowing country to buy products or services from the lending country and debt cancellation are also counted as part of oda apart from food aid there are three main ways of using these funds rural development infrastructures and non project aid financing budget deficits or the balance of payments the latter increases continually this aid is made conditional upon reduction of the public deficit privatization environmental good behaviour care of the very poor democratization etc these conditions are laid down by the main governments of the north the world bank and the imf the aid goes through three channels multilateral aid bilateral aid and the ngos and official aid received by haiti between 2013 and 2017 was us 5 3 billion which falls considerably short of the total resources promised more important than the amount of aid money is how it was spent the promise expressed by haiti special envoy bill clinton in the donors conference in new york in 2010 was to build back better however in the rush to deliver emergency aid and reconstruction a lack of coordination and failure to put local actors in the driving seat led too often to inadequate action the lack of participation of haitian authorities and csos contrasted with the high percentage of foreign companies being awarded reconstruction contracts europeaid for instance awarded 76 6 per cent of the value of the contracts in haiti in 2010 and 2011 to european corporations in total between 2010 and 2012 84 per cent of public funds for the reconstruction were managed outside the haitian administration what now ten years after the earthquake around 30 000 people are still living in camps and 300 000 people live in canaan a new informal settlement on the outskirts of port au prince despite the billions of dollars that flooded the country after the earthquake and the promises to build back better according to the humanitarian needs overview of the united nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs ocha 4 6 million haitians about 40 per cent of the population will require urgent humanitarian assistance in 2020 and there are 3 7 million people in acute food insecurity the political situation does not help economic prospects according to the imf and other development institutions the 10th anniversary of the earthquake is a good moment for the international community to assess its relationship with haiti untying aid and promoting local and regional procurement are basic principles of effective development that should be prioritised by development agencies together with the need to extend these principles to any engagement with the private sector in development on fiscal and debt

with his impeachment trial drawing to a close president donald trump is expected to deliver an economic message in his third state of the union address tuesday night his tone is expected to be markedly different from the foreboding chord he struck in 2017 obviously he s going to have a theme to this speech that is akin to mission accomplished in the sense of branding it as a great american comeback said mark hamrick senior economic analyst at bankrate com by many metrics the economy is healthy but economists say that much of the same data indicates slowing growth and that many of the rosy top line numbers obscure a more nuanced portrait of america s financial health labor market the u s labor market added 145 000 jobs in december for a total of 2 1 million throughout 2019 an average of 176 000 per month according to the bureau of labor statistics while unemployment is at a historic low of 3 5 percent last year s gains failed to match those of 2018 when the economy added 2 7 million jobs an average of 223 000 per month trump frequently claims that his presidency has been a boon for black workers whose unemployment rate is at an all time low but as the left leaning economic policy institute points out that doesn t tell the whole story because black workers are still twice as likely as their white counterparts to be without jobs a disparity that persists throughout all education levels stock market the benchmark s p 500 rose by 29 percent in 2019 although that came on the heels of a december 2018 rout that erased all of the gains for that year in a matter of weeks in spite of a phase one deal that called a truce to the trade war with china business investment remains anemic and higher costs from tariffs weigh on corporate profits stocks have spent the early weeks of 2020 buffeted by those challenges coupled with the unfolding coronavirus crisis the stock market has seen a re emergence of volatility hamrick said that s one of the hallmarks of the return of volatility which is that you can see big swings down as well as up economists point out that since the end of the recession the wealthiest americans have disproportionately benefited from the stock market s meteoric recovery most of the beneficiaries of the economy have been the folks at the top of the income and wealth distribution only half of americans own any stock at all said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics even among the half of the country with exposure to stocks most are invested in index or mutual funds through 401 k or similar retirement vehicles and zandi said a significant number of lower income households are still living paycheck to paycheck consumer confidence the most recent consumer confidence readings preceded the spread of and alarm over the chinese coronavirus before that however the prevailing sentiment was one of optimism according to the conference board about half of americans characterize jobs as plentiful for many the job market is a proxy of sentiment hamrick said the low unemployment rate is a tide that lifts many boats he said consumer confidence might be the biggest unsung hero of the economic momentum that has propelled the expansion in recent quarters although businesses have been keeping cash on the sidelines or using it for stock buybacks ordinary americans have been spending at a steady clip fueling what some economists have dubbed a virtuous cycle of demand and corresponding economic activity residential real estate lower interest rates have reinvigorated home sales which climbed by 3 6 percent in december on a month to month basis with mortgage rates at 3 5 percent financing a home is affordable but the home itself might not be the number of home sales for the year is roughly flat when compared with 2018 although the median price was 274 500 in december a jump of nearly 8 percent on an annualized basis while they are a boon for sellers zandi said rising prices could be keeping homeownership out of reach for many americans the other aspect of that is it makes it difficult for first time homebuyers to get in he said wage growth in spite of record low unemployment economists point out that wage growth remained slack throughout the economic recovery dipping below 3 percent in the most recent report the lack of more substantial and significant wage gains has probably been the primary complaint hamrick said wage growth may well have peaked download the nbc news app for breaking news hamrick added that state and local minimum wage hikes have helped drive income gains for low wage workers nevertheless the distribution of some of these wage gains does have a tendency to lift people at the lowest level of the income spectrum he said the persistently low rate of wage growth has been somewhat mitigated by a parallel trend of muted inflation in the post recession years but the exceptions are big ones for many americans higher costs for health care and education have canceled out the rise in pay those things are challenges that tend to undermine some of the benefits of the improvement in wages hamrick said industrial production manufacturing has been in contraction since late summer as factories struggle with the impact of the trade war higher input costs due to tariffs and reduced demand for u s made goods in china as a result of retaliatory tariffs hamrick referred to the sector s struggle as a self inflicted wound by trump the president to some degree created his own problem by deciding to embark on trade confrontations he said the brunt of the headwinds is being borne by states that were crucial to trump s 2016 win manufacturing has been losing jobs over the past year particularly in key swing states like pennsylvania michigan and wisconsin zandi said that s really an area where his policies particularly his trade policies have been very counterproductive zandi added that the coronavirus epidemic threatens to drag down the sector further as demand for oil copper and other industrial commodities slumps gdp growth economists say steady if sluggish growth in gross domestic product signals no risk of a recession in the near future but the economy has been unable to eke out the kind of growth trump has repeatedly promised even after corporate tax rates were slashed hamrick characterized the president s pledges of outsize gdp growth as unrealistic comparing the economy to a formidable but slow moving ocean liner even though it was given an injection of jet fuel to some degree with the tax cuts and jobs act it now appears that the benefits of the tax law are behind us he said there s no doubt that we ve not seen the return to the sustained 3 percent real gdp growth that president trump spoke of

containment measures in china are expected to cause a contraction in q1 gdp in the world s second biggest economy the resultant disruptions in supply chains and tourist arrivals are causing economic hardship on much of emerging asia as well as advanced economies like australia due to their dependence on china s p global said it would cause a large but temporary drop in china s gdp it lowered its

by pooya stone iran s gas industry is on the verge of complete collapse gas exports have fallen sharply and the gas industry is heavily worn out and there is no money to invest in the gas industry however the government seems to be looking to raise gas prices in the country supply budget deficit with rising gas prices the majlis iran s parliament research center on 26 january announced a dramatic increase in the cost of production transmission and distribution of gas along with debt repayment of energy optimization gas supply and gas collection projects analysts see this as a prelude to rising gas prices an important point in next year s budget statistics and a report by the majlis research center is the increase in the cost of production transmission and distribution of gas by 36 percent to reach nearly 13 trillion tomans on the other hand government debt repayment for gas projects gas collection and energy optimization will increase by 100 percent to 8 trillion tomans gas industry burnout virtually two thirds of iran s domestic gas sales revenue is spent on production and distribution and optimization projects and the gas industry needs tens of billions of dollars of capital to be able to prevent south pars gas production from slipping for the next few years reduction in gas exports to iraq the iraqi ministry of electricity announced in january that iran s supply of gas to this country had fallen sharply over the past three months according to the agreement iran should export 50 million cubic meters of gas to iraq but this figure has so far only been possible on paper iran used to supply 25 million cubic meters of gas a day but now it has fallen to 4 million cubic meters iraqi ministry of electricity spokesman ahmed moussa told bloomberg in january reduced gas exports to turkey deutsche welle also reported on 1 november 2019 statistics from the turkish energy market regulatory office show that the amount of turkish gas imported from iran in august this year decreased by one third compared to the same period last year according to statistics in august iran exported only 160 million cubic meters of gas per day while according to the agreement with turkey it had to export on average 833 million cubic meters per month a contradiction in the production and export of gas however since april 2019 the national gas company has stopped publishing monthly gas statistics and iran s leaders are providing contradictory information on gas production and exports in august 2019 oil minister bijan zanganeh announced that south pars daily production capacity had reached 750 million cubic meters and the country s exports to iraq had peaked at 38 million cubic meters in june mehdi jamshidi dana the director of dispatching the national iranian gas company announced that domestic gas consumption had reached 513 million cubic meters while the industrial gas consumption had reached 127 million cubic meters and the power plant had reached 50 million cubic meters the sum of these three parts amounts to about 690 million cubic meters which is less than the declared amount of gas produced by zanganeh 750 million cubic meters to 60 million cubic meters and the government should have no problem exporting gas to iraq and turkey but the spokesman for the ministry of electricity of iraq is talking about the import of only 4 million cubic meters of gas and the same is true of gas exports to syria the problem of shortage of gas in industrial and power plants meanwhile gas deliveries to iran s industrial and power plants have also fallen sharply national iranian gas company announced on 12 january that domestic and commercial gas consumption exceeded 573 million cubic meters per day which would further limit gas supply to the industrial and power plants and consequently reduce exports gas export money is not returned to the government the problems of the regime in the gas industry do not end here bijan namdar zanganeh recently announced that iraq will not pay us for the gas it receives zanganeh also mentioned in february 2019 that iraq had two billion dollars in debt but that it could not pay because of sanctions the us has given iraq several months of exemptions in the last 15 months ago to continue purchasing electricity and gas from iran and the latest us exemption is due to expire next month the bank of iraq is responsible for transferring iran s gas and electricity money in iraqi dinars to an account in this bank and iran can only use the money to buy humanitarian goods the bank of iraq announced in january 2020 that it will suspend financial transfers between iraq and iran if the united states does not extend the exemptions next month hamid hosseini a spokesman for the regime s petroleum exporters union also said on 29 january iran s gas and electricity exported to iraq will be deposited into the central bank account and sanctions prevent cash withdrawal and 5 billion will be deposited into the iraqi central bank the queue to receive gas capsules the collapse of iran s gas industry has put the country in a situation where in addition to a significant reduction in gas exports inside iran citizens are also facing a shortage of gas on 29 january protesters in zabul in sistan and baluchestan province protested the lack of gas capsules there have also been reports of liquefied petroleum shortages in other cities across the country iran has the world s second largest gas resources a corruption that swept through the structure of government centers such as oil and gas has prevented the gas carrier network from being updated and after years of unnecessary use of gas networks problems are now coming one after another the regime to keep the gas system up to date is now facing serious challenges such as the south pars gas field which supplies more than 25 percent of iran s gas will enter its half life in the next few years and its output is declining rapidly unable to invest to stop its decline the fate of gas exports will become more unclear so when all the ways to make money to offset the budget deficit are closed there is no other solution for the regime than to gain pressure on the people and rising gas prices like a gasoline price hike in the past which ignited widespread protests in the country this can be a spark for uprisings and demonstrations on the street in the coming days and month
colin coleman is co chair of the youth employment service member of boards a former partner at goldman sachs and former senior fellow at yale university s jackson institute africa today accounts for around 17 of the world s population but only about 3 of global gdp these statistics not only attest to a failure to tap the continent s developmental potential but also highlight the tremendous opportunities and risks ahead as long as africa continues to lag economically it will be a source of global instability and extremism but if it rises it could be one of the major sources of growth for the world africa is no stranger to suffering the continent has been ravaged by slavers plundered by colonisers exploited by world powers during the cold war and ravaged by the post colonial conflicts leaving a legacy of relentless volatility horrific violence and widespread poverty consider the atrocities committed by king leopold ii of belgium in the so called congo free state today the democratic republic of the congo drc in the late 1890s as he looted the country s ivory and rubber as adam hochschild recounts in his book king leopold s ghost a young edmund morel who witnessed leopold s plunder for profit described the forced labour directed by the closest associates as terrible and continuous women were abducted and raped men were enslaved and worked to death resisters risked death and their hands would be severed while they were still alive as proof of punishment and with nobody left to cultivate or find food millions suffered near famine and died of diseases that they might have survived otherwise it must be bad enough to stumble upon a murder recalled morel i had stumbled upon a secret society of murderers with a king for a croniman well over a century later the drc still struggles to maintain peace and stability let alone secure growth and development indeed all of central africa has suffered from seemingly unremitting conflicts a dynamic that since the end of the cold war developed into an avalanche of killing and destruction as the regional analyst and advocate kris berwouts put it a decade ago approximately six million people died as a direct or indirect consequence of the two wars in the drc in 1996 1997 and 1998 2002 which followed the brutal genocide in rwanda yet in spite of this history africa has managed to make important gains in recent decades in sub saharan africa gdp growth has averaged 5 per year since 2000 for the entire continent the rate is only slightly lower moreover according to a 2019 world bank report poverty in africa defined as income of less than 1 90 per day declined from 54 in 1990 to just over 41 affecting about 400 million people in 2015 if the economy continues to grow at today s rate through 2030 the continent s poverty rate will decline to 23 given rates of poverty reduction elsewhere in the world however this would still represent a rising share of global poverty africa has the potential to go much further the world s youngest and fastest urbanising continent africa will have 24 million more people on average living in its cities each year between 2015 and 2045 more than india and china combined according to a 2016 mckinsey company estimate this implies major increases in consumption already spending by consumers and businesses in africa totals 4 trillion household consumption is expected to grow by 3 8 annually until 2025 reaching 2 1 trillion and business spending should grow from 2 6 trillion in 2015 to 3 5 trillion in 2025 altogether the mckinsey report predicts 5 6 trillion in african business opportunities by 2025 some of these opportunities lie in agriculture if africa which possesses 60 of the world s uncultivated arable land intensified its agricultural productivity it could produce 2 3 times more cereals and grains with similar increases in horticulture crops and livestock other opportunities lie in infrastructure as of 2010 africa still needed at least 46 billion in additional spending each year to upgrade its energy water and transportation networks of course some valuable investment opportunities also involve africa s abundant natural resources which include 10 of the world s oil reserves 40 of its gold and 80 of its platinum but the importance of such resources to africa s future prosperity shouldn t be overestimated according to a 2019 goldman sachs economic research report commodities have accounted for only around 30 of africa s gdp growth since 2000 in fact the report concludes the drivers of africa s secular acceleration appear to be deep and structural this reflects success which needs to be reinforced from now on by continuing to strengthen institutions support political stability promote democratisation enhance policy coordination improve ease of doing business reduce debt open financial markets attract foreign direct investment facilitate technology transfers and nurture human capital such as through education and health care some countries particularly the smaller economies of east africa are already demonstrating how powerful such reforms can be if the entire continent took this approach sustaining and accelerating the needed reforms over the next half century some believe that africa could emulate china s rapid rise of the last 50 years but not everyone is optimistic about africa s ability to fulfill its promise some doubt that the continent will manage to overcome its legacy of slavery colonialism and great power competition there are also concerns about the global economic landscape especially trade tensions between the united states and china and the attendant effects on growth and commodity prices much will hinge on the performance of africa s largest economies egypt nigeria and south africa and progress on making the african continental free trade area a functioning regional economic bloc if africa succeeds it could lift millions of its own out of poverty while serving as a stable and prosperous economic partner for the rest of the world otherwise the continent will remain constrained by poverty institutional lethargy and corruption which will feed instability and possibly spill over to the rest of the world africa will soon be home to one fifth of the global population the world would sleep easier if the continent could put itself on the road to growth and prosperity bm copyright project syndicate 2020
many investors are scratching their heads about why us stocks fell sharply after this morning s non farm payrolls report some media outlets blame the move on concerns about china s economy and profit taking after a strong week however a deeper look into the details of the jobs report quickly reveals underlying weakness the unemployment rate was expected to stay at 3 5 but it rose to 3 6 and most worryingly wage growth missed expectations with the chinese economy slowing this is the first sign of similar trouble ahead for the us economy federal reserve officials have expressed little concern about the impact of coronavirus but fear can be a powerful driver of consumer and business demand currency traders on the other hand drove the us dollar higher against all of the major currencies with the exception of the japanese yen which held at pre nfp levels the dollar rises when there is risk aversion so the move is consistent with the sell off in stocks however the relative stability of usd jpy is a sign that while investors are worried about the global impact of coronavirus they believe the us economy will fare better than others for now the jobs number changes nothing monetary policy will remain unchanged as the fed waits to see how world growth is affected according to the white house based on the past and what they are seeing a drop of 0 2 is expected its likely to be far more than that but with strong q4 earnings it could take q1 warnings to cement the top in stocks and turn usd jpy the most important report on next week s calendar will be us retail sales if consumer spending slows red flags will be up and investors could be scared into deeper profit taking after hitting record highs this week we look for a steeper pullback in equities in the second week of february for currencies this means a near term top for pairs like usdjpy and usdcad the currency hit the hardest is the australian dollar which fell to a 10 year low friday investors were not pleased by china s decision to delay trade data a sign that the numbers could be too ugly to publish even if it is only moderately weaker the government could be worried that it will trip further selling dovish comments from rba governor lowe didn t help the central bank lowered their gdp forecast in response to the bushfires and coronavirus to 2 from 2 5 for the year ending june 2020 lowe said if the economy were to hit a rough spot easing is an option the new zealand dollar fell in sympathy as investors look forward to similarly cautious comments from the reserve bank of new zealand next week meanwhile usd cad is flashing signs of a top unlike the us job growth doubled expectations in january with an increase of 34 5k compared to 17 5k forecast the unemployment rate also dropped to 5 5 instead of rising to 5 7 as expected wage growth jumped to 4 4 from 3 8 ivey pmi rose to 57 3 from 51 9 a sign of improvement in manufacturing despite the central bank s cautious outlook these are very good numbers and given usd cad s recent rally profit taking is due there are no major canadian economic reports to threaten this move in the coming week making it a low risk trade euro and sterling both extended their losses german trade and industrial production numbers were very weak while sterling fell victim to a rising dollar fourth quarter gdp numbers are due from both in week ahead so eur and gbp will be in play
it is not correct to say pastoring is lucrative when you hear ituah ighodalo what immediately comes to your mind is pastoring and his church trinity house but the ebullient pastor in a recent

corporate organisations they come to us to help them solve their corporate problems and of course that includes government and non governmental organisations the popular opinion out there is that pastoring is a vocation for the not too adventurous but here you are a partner in a big firm why didn t you just sit back and enjoy the lucrative fruits of pastoring let me say that it is not quite correct that pastoring is lucrative a lot of the time what people see is the result of the years of pain you see a man who seems after 25 or 30 years in the ministry to be living a decent or even flamboyant lifestyle you forget that there was a time when he couldn t eat when he couldn t drive a car or was sleeping in a one room apartment all by himself every glory has a story so if eventually overtime somehow the labour of his hands begins to yield it doesn t necessarily mean that it is lucrative besides those who truly want to be pastors are people who really want to serve and make life better for other people if along the line there are some benefits here and there i think that is okay as well what do you say to those who describe it as vocation for the not too adventurous laughs it is true that unfortunately a few pastors have given the connotation that they want to live off pasturing and don t really want to work but really pasturing if you are really committed to it is very intense involving and hard job first you have study the bible it s a lot of work second you read other books and other forms of inspiration three you pray diligently i ve had a vigil all night i got into bed at 5 and i got up at 7 and i ve been up on my feet since them four you also have to prepare messages and preach on sundays and even wednesday that takes a lot of effort five you re on call people call you 24 hours from 5am my phone has been ringing and then there is administrative work to do you have to run an organisation six there is the ministering to people somebody is sick you re there somebody is dying you re there naming ceremony you re there so pastoral work is tough for someone who really wants to pastor so imagine when you now have to combine it with circular work and other volunteer activities in a way i m grateful to god especially now that i m beginning to create time for myself and my family as a pastor if you don t take your time your family may suffer you just painted a picture of a superman how do you manage the energy comes from god but i manage myself well i take it one thing at a time and i delegate as best as i can i have a few good people who work with me and if you find good people to work with you then it makes the whole thing a joy and on my part this is my life it is not a job or a chore so for me it s not a stress still on pastoring there is a raging controversy on tithe and tithing some say pastors practically establish churches to collect tithes for personal enrichment well tithing is biblical and it is spiritual the origin of tithe dates back to a gentleman called abram who after he had won a serious battle gave a tenth of what he got in the battle to a gentleman called melchizedeck who was a representative of god it was an offering of gratitude and thanks for deliverance from life issues it was a spiritual action secondly when jacob was escaping from canaan and going back to his uncle s place in haran he also made a covenant with god that if you protect me and bring me back to my father s house of everything that you give me i will give you a tenth but it was instituted in the wilderness when god said i need a section of you to spend their time and energy to listen to me serve me the rest of you pay a tithe to me so that i can use that tithe to help everybody fulfil their spiritual aspiration so it has become a compulsion and then of course with the things of god there are blessings joys so i fully believe in the payment of tithe i fully believe in giving to god to help god do his job and i fully believe in the support of people who are committed to god s work so that they can focus on god s work and the rest of us can carry on with our activities it s the beginning of the year and many pastors are prophesying or making predictions do you have any to share with our readers let me separate between predictions and prophesies and being actually able to hear from god concerning a situation a prediction comes from an evaluation and analysis of certain situations and extrapolations into the future for instance if the clouds are dark and the atmosphere is humid i can safely predict that it is going to rain either in the evening or tomorrow so if i analyse what is going on in nigeria i can make a prediction a prophesy is a wish into the future you prophesy that by god s grace it will be well sometimes god would hear that prophesy and back it and make it happen because things are done by the power of the mouth however visions of the future are things that you see clearly that somehow or the other god through whatever means has spoken to you like joseph dreaming that his brothers would serve him sometimes it is the bible itself that speaks to you sometimes it is a man of god and sometimes it is a voice speaking to you to your question about vision for nigeria or whether i have heard from god i ve not heard a clear word of god as to whether this or that would happen in nigeria but i ve heard concerning my life and concerning the life of my parishioners nigeria is regarded by many as being very religious on account of her numerous worship centres especially churches yet it appears immorality and criminality has continued to rise as a result people have said that pastors have failed what would you say to this yes no and half no and i d give you my reasons it s not everybody who says he s a pastor that is actually doing the things of christ so even pastors themselves need a bit of redemption secondly the rot in nigeria is so deep that it s going to take a lot more efforts to change it thirdly while pastors are influential in certain areas there are some people who are more influential than pastors who drive people s thinking a lot of people in government drive the thinking of people even more than pastors are doing because not only do they control the media they also control the wallet and sometimes you hear the people saying pastor na your own you dey talk o or pastor e joko sibe na that one i go chop so there are influences in the society competing with the pastors maybe we pastors should deal more with the leadership and i think that is where pastors have failed maybe we have not spoken truth to leadership sufficiently for different reasons ranging from gratification to being in their good books or because they threatened us so one thing i and my church is trying to do is to is to be honest and to speak truth to the nation you certainly struck a chord with former president olusegun obasanjo from the way he related with you at the recent why i am alive campaign organised by caroline moore in lagos many have different opinions about the former president what do you think of him one general obasanjo is a nice man two he s a very warm and open man and he makes friends very easily even at his age three he s very hardworking four he has passion for nigeria but where he has failed is that in the one two or three instances that he had an opportunity to make significant difference in our nation he bowed to the spirit and pressure of nigeria he bowed to that thinking that has made nigeria what it is such that he changes his mind concerning certain things and makes u turn when he should be steadfast for that reason a few people find him if you like ambivalent and that is why some people sort of draw back from him but he s been one of the most passionate one of the most hardworking and most vigorous concerning the nigerian project he was very particular about nigeria s debt situation as an accountant do you share his worries yes i do you cannot live off what you have not generated the bible says the borrower is servant to the lender the reason why nigeria is where we are today is because some leaders put us into debt many years ago then world bank came imf came london club came paris club came and started giving us orders devalue your currency restructure your economy you can t sell petrol at this price it s because they lent us money and you are not able to pay when nigeria was a net lender even to england our currency was stronger than the british pounds in my lifetime and the fundamentals haven t changed what changed was the thinking and approach of our leaders and they were influenced from outside the problem many do not know is that nigeria is still very significantly influenced from outside especially by the british and the americans the british left a roadmap a dna for an unworkable nigeria tell them i said so and i don t blame them your vassal state tells you they want independence are you going to make it easy for them or make it difficult for you not to be able to control them these people left in pain so they left behind a script a nigeria that would work to their benefit and not to the benefit of nigerians they divided us into three groups and for each group they left a last will and testament which has caused a lot of disunity and distrust such that tribes are played up against one another and they don t trust one another some people think their right is power it was the british that gave them that idea some people are ambivalent they re neither here nor there it was the british that gave them that formula and some people are pushed to one side it was the british that left that template before they stage a coup in nigeria britain and america know sometimes they even sponsor and motivate them they do it all over africa not just in nigeria even in iran now they re doing it what borders me however is why we after 60 years of independence cannot speak to one another and collectively come together and face a common enemy the nigerian resource the nigerian people are much stronger if we can realise our potential than the whole of europe what resources do they have in europe that we don t have in manifold most of our resources they take from here and go and use to benefit their economy how can you harvest yam in your backyard harvest it and then send it to london to eign oil companies who don t make proper account are complicit in this so by just accounting properly for oil and defending it we ll get double what we re getting right now secondly nigeria must feed itself if nigeria feeds herself and we don t import any food we ll save 3 or 4billion dollars and feeding ourselves is not a big deal very simple put the word out we are not importing food we re not importing fruits we can grow them all here thirdly bring the educational institutions here let our children stop going out to be trained we have land what s the big deal about building a school and if we don t have enough teachers let us bring the teachers here to come and teach our children rather than carry our children to go and meet the teachers do you know how much it costs to educate a child in england for one year it cost at least fifty thousand pounds school fee alone is thirty thousand pounds and the child must come back and forth by aircraft the mother goes once or twice a year then the father if he has three children there will eventually buy an apartment there so you end up spending almost a million pounds going out of nigeria imagine how many of our children we have in all these places even in ghana so if we can arrest all these spending then we will have more than enough to grow our economy we should build and harness all our resources we have gold we have bitumen surface bitumen we have diamond we have marble bauxite and nobody is touching them you are such an erudite pastor you talk business you talk economy you talk politics yet people are against pastors going into politics how can you stay away from leadership it s not possible it s even a wrong notion to say pastors should stay away from politics maybe what you re trying to say is that pastors should not be partisan because your congregation has different kinds of people but a pastor must be involved and interested in those who are going to lead the country a pastor must have access to them he must be able to speak to them what he has heard from god and if he hasn t heard from god he must tell them what his conscience his morality and understanding of the word of god are saying he might just not necessarily contest an election but if he chooses to leave his pulpit and run for office he s a citizen of nigeria he s entitled to it i am leading a vanguard to look for right leadership in nigeria from wherever whether apc or pdp but we must define a profile of the kind of person that can lead us you must be of a certain look and feel you must have a certain level of exposure you must have a passion for nigeria you must be fair you must be detribalised and be ready for even development you must be well spoken well travelled understand economy and have a track record because you can t give what you don t have in china they prepare their leaders in singapore you must have run a fortune 500 company a man would take you only in the direction he understands and knows as chairman you played a prominent role in the why i am alive campaign most likely you played a major role in bringing obasanjo to speak at the programme why did you key into the programme it s not just caroline or why i am alive campaign that i work with i work with many people i think one of the gifts god has given me is the ability to help others fulfil their dreams i want everybody to succeed i can t remember how i met caroline all i know is that one day she came into my office and she had different kinds of ideas and i d listen to her patiently and try to point her in certain directions and give her as much support as i could all i know is that i want her to succeed because if she succeeds she d help others succeed so when she came up with this why i am alive project which is about laying a new trajectory for nigeria and leaders mentoring young people why would i not support a thing like that and when she said please i d like chief obasanjo to speak at the gathering i said no problem because i had a good relationship with him we gave him option of date he picked a date and we began to plan and i m glad that all went well
business aviation chinedu eze writes on the suspension and disruption of flights due to the fear and effect of coronavirus which has claimed many lives when coronavirus was announced to the world two about two weeks ago the world was yet to appreciate its devastating effect but the world became petrified when the figures of the victims began to rise world health organisation who which treated it with levity initially literally mounted the rostrum to warn about how lethal the disease china quickly took a critical but radical step to quarantine the city wuhan and ensured nobody travels in and out of the city while everyone is appalled about coronavirus it is feared that it would spread very fast through air travel that reality set on a panic button and like ebola and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars airlines and airports have put up stringent measured to checkmate the spread of the virus ironically like coronavirus sars started in china in 2002 so the most populous country seemed to be the most determined to find cure for the virus as at friday about 7 711 persons had died of the virus in china airlines pull out reports indicate that american airlines united airlines british airways air france lufthansa swiss australian airlines lion air finnair cathay pacific and ural airlines have cancelled flights to china due to wuhan coronavirus outbreak fears of the virus have led to plummeting demand for travel to china air france suspended its three weekly flights to wuhan on january 24 but as of wednesday morning said it was maintaining its 23 weekly flights to beijing and shanghai afp reported that british airways which flies daily from london s heathrow airport to shanghai and beijing said it had suspended all its flights to and from mainland china indonesia s lion air group southeast asia s biggest carrier by fleet size is halting all its flights to and from china owing to the deadly coronavirus a company spokesman said wednesday hong kong based carrier cathay pacific said it would progressively reduce capacity by 50 per cent or more on its routes to mainland china from thursday through to the end of march adding that the reduction concerns both cathay pacific and its cathay dragon subsidiary also finnair said the suspension of group travel from china was leading it to suspend some flights beginning february 5 through most of march us carrier united airlines said it would trim its service to china from the united states in light of a big drop in demand following a call by us health officials to avoid non essential travel to the country russia s urals airlines which had already suspended flights to several destinations in china also announced on wednesday that it was cutting some services to europe popular with chinese tourists including paris and rome because of the outbreak economic impact cnn com reported recently that the coronavirus could cost china s economy 60 billion this quarter urging that beijing would have to act fast to avert a bigger hit china may have to cut taxes boost spending and slash interest rates to prevent the coronavirus outbreak wreaking havoc on an already fragile economy the economic impact of the virus is still impossible to determine but one state media outlet and some economists have said that china s growth rate could drop two percentage points this quarter because of the outbreak which has brought large parts of the country to a standstill a decline on that scale could mean 62 billion in lost growth cnn reported the report noted that china could ill afford that kind of hit and remarked that growth last year was already the country s weakest in nearly three decades as china contended with rising debt and the fallout from its trade war with the united states the report said so far policymakers have taken some steps to help the businesses that are most affected by the rapid spread of the disease central and local governments have allocated 12 6 billion so far to spend on medical treatment and equipment major banks have cut interest rates for small businesses and individuals in the worst hit areas and the bank of china said it would allow people in wuhan and the rest of hubei province to delay their loan payments for several months if they lose their source of income because of the disruption the people s bank of china the country s central bank has said that it would ensure there is enough liquidity in the financial markets when they reopen next monday after a 10 day lunar new year holiday when hong kong s markets reopened earlier this week the hang seng index hsi plunged nearly 6 per cent in just a few days of trading effect on airlines with the cancellation and suspension of flights international airlines are counting their losses because china has been a big boost to global air travel due to their huge population experts said that in the short term this coronavirus would have significant effect on revenues but this would become less severe in the long run cnn quoted financial analyst ken herbert with financial services firm canaccord who said although it s very early into the current coronavirus outbreak several other outbreaks in recent years provide a framework that can be applied to the current situation the note mentioned that although the current outbreak appears to be spreading faster than those past viruses it has been less deadly so far herbert said an average revenue drop of 13 per cent has been observed over past outbreaks citing data from the international air transport association an airline trade organisation however we believe that all things considered traffic tends to recover relatively quickly after a pandemic outbreak he said the brunt of the impact is expected to be borne by chinese airlines that service wuhan the epicenter of the outbreak particularly those like china southern china eastern and air china economic sledgehammer the current virus has drawn comparison to the severe acute respiratory syndrome or sars outbreak in 2003 a natural connection because both are caused by a coronavirus sars had a higher fatality rate about 10 per cent compared to 3 per cent from the current virus which made it an economic sledgehammer to airlines in the asia pacific region the canaccord report said as a result of sars which ultimately infected around 8 100 people the report said revenue per passenger kilometer otherwise known as rpk and also measured in revenue per passenger mile or rpm fell by 35 per cent at the worst of the outbreak and led to an 8 decline in rpks in the region for all of 2003 the 2015 middle east respiratory syndrome or mers outbreak also led to a strong impact although the infection only reached 1 300 people in the middle east and south korea the report cited an unusually high 38 per cent fatality rate led to a 12 per cent dive in rpks in the south korean market for the first month of the disease s spread although passenger volumes recovered within two months in the past the size of the total infected population seemed to have more of an impact on airline revenue than the lethality of the disease the 2005 avian flu outbreak in asia had a staggering 52 per cent mortality rate but only about 116 people were infected regional rpks only dropped 2 per cent and recovered quickly reuters reported that china s growth has helped power a global aviation boom over the last decade but as the country curtails travel in the face of a new coronavirus a slowdown could hit the industry harder than ever before prevention thisday learnt that the federal airports authority of nigeria faan is already working with the port health department of the federal ministry of health to ensure that the virus is not imported into the country all measures used to contain the dreaded ebola virus have been re activated afresh and more precautionary measures have also been taken to contain any eventuality faan said the regional manager in charge of mmia mrs victoria shin aba told thisday in lagos on wednesday that faan has activated public health emergency system and all stakeholders involved with air travel are being carried along she also disclosed that sensitisation is being carried out by a committee on communicable diseases being supported by the world health organisation who adding that a national emergency meeting was held friday in abuja and on monday faan will hold another meeting to domesticate the decisions taken at the national level shin aba also said the agency has warned its staff to be very careful adding that faan was considering limiting the operations of some airlines but that would need to be approved by higher authorities but we have directed all our staff who have anything to do with passengers to be more careful while processing passengers we have also issued directives that anyone suspected to be exposed to the virus should be immediately quarantined we have also involved the lagos state government and we are strictly abiding by the health emergency plan we are prepared for this because before the coronavirus we were working on similar problem and that made us to be more prepared she said

using rng better for the environment than diesel with fewer particulates and carbon emissions but it s also a net positive reducing the environmental impact of other human activities and before you dismiss clean energy as an eventual loser to electric vehicles the reality is there aren t really any heavy duty electric trucks anywhere close to commercial production today and the ones in the

after hurricane maria when a year and a half passed before power was fully restored the earthquake s impact on puerto rico s power grid was the opposite of maria s during maria it was the transmission lines that were destroyed across the island with the earthquake it was the power plants themselves but in both situations the problem was essentially the same puerto rico s electric grid is too centralized to be resilient while about 70 percent of power is generated in the south 70 percent of demand is in the north earthquake damage at the church of immaculate conception in guayanilla puerto

diet requires refrigeration and her 8 year old son fears the dark an anxiety that can induce asthma attacks which pérez manages using a machine for respiratory therapy but electricity was one thing the family didn t have to worry about after the earthquake in the wake of hurricane maria the nearby environmental nonprofit casa pueblo had identified her family as having significant electricity needs and installed solar panels on her roof we have the security that we ll at least have light pérez said as a mother it gives me peace psychologically and emotionally immediately following the hurricane casa pueblo s solar fueled headquarters buzzed with community members trying to cope with the power outages after the earthquake we were not as busy said the organization s board president arturo massol deyá the homes of aging residents who require dialysis a restaurant that supplied meals in the aftermath the storm and a barbershop that functions as a community hub are just a few of the 150 locations where casa pueblo installed panels after maria the earthquake proved that the system worked photo christopher gregory for the intercept the federal and local governments were not as successful in rebuilding a resilient power infrastructure within a week of the earthquake officials were bragging that power had been restored on most of the island but it was a fragile recovery an estimated 20 000 people remained displaced with 7 000 living in refugee facilities many of them informal camps since the schools that have historically been used in emergency situations do not meet modern building codes designed to withstand earthquakes the costa sur plant will remain out of commission for at least a year according to the publicly owned power authority prepa and the electricity enjoyed by 99 percent of residents was little comfort for the 3 564 who remained without power occasional blackouts continued the earthquake highlights the fragility of the system in general and that we haven t done much in terms of moving from fossil fuels to renewables or shifting to a decentralized grid said sergio marxuach an expert in energy policy at the puerto rican think tank center for a new economy if we had done that we wouldn t have seen outages across the island for now puerto rico s electric grid is running on backup units burning dirtier more expensive diesel this summer will be a dangerous time not only does energy demand go up by around 10 percent as the temperatures rise but hurricane season will start in june with puerto rico running on a compromised system if prepa is unable to pay for new generators it will have to begin forced blackouts throughout the island when summer hits i would have to suspend service to 20 percent or 25 percent of the customers every day the island s top energy official josé ortiz said in an interview with the puerto rican newspaper el nuevo día the federal emergency management agency denied an initial application for assistance that s not the way it was supposed to go nearly a year ago the governor of puerto rico signed a law to much fanfare committing the island to 100 percent renewable energy by 2050 the press emphasized that the system would rely on solar arrays powering distributed microgrids so that if infrastructure went out on one part of the island it wouldn t impact other areas whatever we do now might affect the next two generations but critics say the pledge was smoke and mirrors buried in the same legislation was a road map for building out natural gas infrastructure likely to lock in consumption of fossil fuels and a centralized grid for decades to come that plan has already begun to be implemented natural gas infrastructure has gone up seemingly overnight they re obviously prioritizing natural gas over everything else marxuach said at least eight u s states and territories have set mandates that local energy systems move to 100 percent renewable or clean energy over the next 30 years but whether the ambitious commitments will be met with meaningful action is yet to be seen there are few places where the stakes are so high and the margin of error so thin as in puerto rico if electricity becomes too expensive and unreliable as it is poised to with the impacts of climate change intensifying puerto ricans will be forced to abandon the island the important thing is to get it right said marxuach whatever we do now might affect the next two generations arturo massol deyá at a farm and education center run by casa pueblo massol deyá is a leader in the movement for community solar on the island photo christopher gregory for the intercept a transition from the bottom up in the wake of hurricane maria the power system s failure was a key factor in the estimated 4 645 deaths associated with the storm hospitals and senior homes lost air conditioning and refrigeration vital communication networks stopped functioning in part due to a lack of power illnesses and injuries that would normally be manageable spiraled into health crises in response a movement demanding an island wide shift to rooftop solar energy was born for massol deyá and his parents alexis massol gonzález and tinti deyá díaz who founded casa pueblo a vision evolved of an adjuntas that relied on itself for electricity and disaster management not the local or federal governments in addition to installing solar panels casa pueblo expanded a farm project to enhance the community s food security it wasn t just resiliency that emerged much of puerto rico s politics have been defined by lines dividing those who want statehood for the island and those who want the island to be independent of u s governance it s a fight that has at times overlooked the immediate needs of the people but another kind of politics was developing in adjuntas the people are different they ve learned to break the energy dependence they are people who run their own system massol gonzález said it s a concept known as auto gestión which roughly translates to self management and which many islanders view as key to breaking the colonial relationship between puerto rico and the united states as massol gonzález put it inside a colony energy independence is revolutionary casa pueblo began to call for no less than an energy insurrection at face value the momentum for renewable energy seemed to extend to the island s government in the wake of the storm puerto rico s legislature introduced a bill to shift 50 percent of the island s power to renewable energy by 2050 potential seed money for the new energy system appeared around the same time the u s congress set aside 2 billion to restore and modernize the power grid the town center of adjuntas casa pueblo has teamed with the honnold foundation to energize the town center as proof that small solar grids are a sustainable way to relieve dependence on fossil fuels photos christopher gregory for the intercept but there were other forces at play puerto rico had been in a recession for more than a decade and the island s debt ballooned as wall street took advantage of tax breaks and lax regulations in 2016 barack obama s administration appointed a financial oversight management board known locally as the junta to control the island government s spending and come up with a plan to pay back creditors prepa the power authority was responsible for a large proportion of the debt 9 billion so in january 2018 then gov ricardo rosselló announced that he would privatize prepa many puerto ricans viewed the move as the latest in a series of austerity measures meant to appease debt holders at the expense of the people although it s true that the agency had long been plagued by corruption and mismanagement under regulated capitalism had wreaked havoc on the island and many doubted that the free market would offer rates and resiliency favorable to the island s population duke energy pseg services and a consortium of utility companies soon emerged as top contenders to take over the transmission and distribution system the privatization would give the winner s shareholders a disproportionate say in the island s future inside a colony energy independence is revolutionary meanwhile despite the growing momentum within the government for a transition to renewable energy it was clear that government officials did not view organizations like casa pueblo as a partner in the shift with prepa we have never been invited to talk about it or discuss an alternative said massol deyá we ve had no support or dialogue at all in fact casa pueblo has long been at odds with the puerto rican government massol gonzález founded the organization to fight plans for an open pit mine and its early history is recorded in a foot high stack of police files for decades until the mid 1980s with the support of the fbi puerto rican police intensively surveilled anyone who could be framed as an adversary of the government including environmental activists the files which massol gonzález and his family accessed after such political surveillance was outlawed revealed that nearly every meeting the organization held had been reported in detail to the police one of massol gonzález s closest confidants it turned out had been working for law enforcement massol deyá a child at the time is mentioned repeatedly in the documents left top the puerto rico police intelligence division file for alexis massol gonzález for 40 years the police department and the fbi conducted a mass surveillance program in puerto rico aimed at dismantling the pro independence movement right bottom massol gonzález at casa pueblo in adjuntas photos christopher gregory for the intercept the mine was ultimately canceled and casa pueblo went on to beat back a natural gas pipeline proposal in the early 2010s throughout the fight massol deyá who had also been pushing the u s navy to clean up contamination from bomb testing on the island of vieques was routinely detained by the u s department of homeland security when he flew although casa pueblo s purpose continued to evolve it s not clear that the government s view of the organization ever changed in the summer after the hurricane rep nancy pelosi paid a visit to casa pueblo a signal that the organization s goals were becoming increasingly mainstream later that day as massol deyá returned home with his daughter after sharing a meal at a local pizzeria he was handcuffed and arrested by police who claimed that he had been driving drunk no fewer than three prosecutors from puerto rico s justice department which was led at the time by current gov wanda vázquez attended his trial a receipt and testimony from the pizzeria owner would show that massol deyá had consumed only a coca cola and the judge dismissed the case to massol deyá it was obviously a smear attempt by puerto rican officials meant to discredit casa pueblo s work by framing him as a drunk and a criminal puerto rico s justice department did not respond to a request for comment the government s hostility did little to slow the movement for community solar in october 2018 a coalition of activists engineers and academics released a proposal titled queremos sol or we want sun the plan called on elected officials to double the renewable energy goal to 100 percent renewables by 2050 rather than building solar installations on land that could be viable for food production the panels would be constructed on dead spaces rooftops landfills brownfields parking lots the proposal suggested some of the investment money could come out of federal hurricane recovery funds queremos sol allowed for the temporary use of fuels like natural gas but demanded a moratorium on new fossil fuel plants and it called for a full audit of the debt and the elimination of commitments that passed on the debt burden to prepa customers power in puerto rico is more expensive than in any u s state outside of hawaii over the lifetime of a rooftop system it s cheaper for the average energy user to disconnect from the grid and rely on solar panels than it is to pay prepa s rates said agustín irizarry rivera a university of puerto rico engineering professor and member of the coalition that developed queremos sol within five years the cost of rooftop solar is likely to drop lower than the rates associated with imported natural gas a bodega in adjuntas powered by solar panels installed by casa pueblo photo christopher gregory for the intercept however installing solar involves a steep initial investment without sufficient public support only individuals or communities that have money to invest will be able to buy panels as those with resources abandon the grid for cheaper and more resilient solar the power grid s client base will shrink forcing rates to rise the gap between the rich and the poor will widen and puerto rico s most impoverished will be left with more expensive less reliable power when storms hit the poor will be left alone in the dark and those who can will simply move away further shrinking the power authority s revenues there are no technical barriers here said irizarry rivera political will is the impediment to developing renewables around the world and puerto rico is no exception within a few weeks of the energy proposal s release rosselló tweeted that he supported the goal of 100 percent renewables by 2050 but when the governor signed the renewable energy legislation the energy public policy act last april advocates for queremos sol were not impressed they did take on the 100 percent renewable energy goal for 2050 but that s where the similarities end said ruth santiago another collaborator on the plan and an organizer with the jobos bay eco development initiative which is developing a community solar system in the south massol deyá agreed they are setting goals they are not intending to comply with he said it s a means to stop the transition that is being pushed from the bottom up a caribbean liquid natural gas hub another vision of puerto rico s energy future was emerging in parallel to queremos sol last february prepa released a first draft of its 15 billion integrated resource plan prepared by the multinational industrial firm siemens which divided the island into eight minigrids and included a significant investment in solar battery storage it also proposed an array of new liquid natural gas import facilities pipelines and natural gas fired power plants prepa s head josé ortiz explained the plan to an audience of executives from the liquid natural gas industry a month later at the american lng summit held in puerto rico only days before the renewable energy legislation passed over the next two years natural gas infrastructure would be placed in locations along the four cardinal directions of the island he said replacing oil fueled generation renewables would come later as quick as the price dictates it would be unwise to invest in them now ortiz added when in a few years they would become significantly cheaper prepa s history of mismanagement was not proving to be an impediment to the natural gas buildout he assured investors were already lining up including singapore based puma energy a company with ties to elías sánchez a notoriously corrupt political powerbroker on the island new fortress energy whose co founder is a major democratic party donor and aes owner of the island s only coal plant for which pedro pierluisi a top contender for the island s 2020 governor s race once lobbied the palo seco power plant which officials plan to rebuild to burn natural gas photo christopher gregory for the intercept prepa did not respond to requests for comment but a hint as to why the power authority would encourage such investment lies in the campaign contribution records of resident commissioner jenniffer gonzález colón the island s only elected representative in washington d c her two top contributors since 2016 are crowley maritime corp which donated a total of 12 900 and saltchuk resources inc which donated 15 500 crowley is a major shipper of liquid natural gas between jacksonville florida and puerto rico and a contender for supplying prepa s proposed gas powered microgrids with lng meanwhile saltchuk s subsidiary tote is responsible for the world s first lng powered container ships two of which operate between florida and puerto rico the company hopes to spark the proliferation of natural gas as a transportation fuel the other two such ships operating out of jacksonville named el coquí after a small frog whose song is ubiquitous in puerto rico and the taíno after the indigenous people of the island are owned by crowley a booming lng business in puerto rico would be a boon for those companies and many others the resident commissioner did not respond to a request for comment it s no mystery why the companies donated to gonzález colón the resident commissioner is an evangelist for lng on the island she co hosted the 2019 american lng summit with florida rep ted yoho and the pair has co sponsored a bill to make lng export easier at the summit last march gonzález colón and some of puerto rico s top officials stood up one by one asserting support for a common vision puerto rico as a caribbean hub for liquid natural gas it s an idea that s been around since before hurricane maria gubernatorial candidate pierluisi for example advocated for it when he served as resident commissioner but it gained new traction after the storm picking up republicans in the states as well as puerto rican policymakers photo kristie boyd u s house office of photography in welcoming remarks at the conference rosselló urged attendees from the industry to at some point see as a connector of the americas where we can not only use the lng but also become an important hub toward transporting it after the storm there is opportunity he said there is a government that is willing to make policy changes there is a clear path of where we want to go with lng beyond the laudable goal of 100 percent renewable energy much of the rest of the energy public policy act is in line with that vision the law demands that all existing and future power plants that process fossil fuels become capable of handling at least two types of fuel one of which must be natural gas it also lays out a pathway for prepa s privatization like massol deyá and the authors of queremos sol the public officials advocating for natural gas saw the power transition required in the wake of the hurricane as a means to develop a new kind of economy but while massol deyá s vision looked inward toward communities empowered to support themselves and their neighbors the puerto rican government s plan was to use the grid rehabilitation to attract outside investors and become a key node in a global fossil fuel economy another proposal that will define puerto rico s energy future came in april the junta s proposed debt restructuring agreement the junta s vision of puerto rico s future is grim according to a spokesperson for the financial oversight management board matthias rieker it s inevitable that people will continue to divest from the grid we don t think the puerto rican economy is going to grow very robustly we think the population is going to continue decline in puerto rico he explained the grid is notoriously unreliable he continued and businesses in particular are beginning to disconnect and operate on their own systems the unelected board members proposed raising rates for all energy consumers via a transition charge which would start at 2 7 additional cents per kilowatt hour and eventually rise to 4 5 cents prepa customers who installed rooftop solar panels would pay the creditors fee on all energy they used including what they generated themselves a highly unusual arrangement most people who install solar panels stay connected to the grid to ensure consistent access to power to disconnect entirely and avoid any outages would require individuals to purchase an excess of battery storage which can be expensive utilities typically charge customers for the amount of energy they consume from the grid minus the amount they contribute from their solar panels a meter measures the amount of energy a house is taking in as well as the amount it is adding to the grid the restructuring plan would eliminate at least a few of the dollars rooftop solar users save every month on energy which for some could be enough to render solar unfeasible it would also require prepa customers with rooftop solar to install a second meter to measure the energy traveling between the solar panels and the home since standard meters do not measure how much power a home system is pulling from solar the meter could cost as much as 1 000 per home essentially a regressive tax since it would most impact those with small systems the government s plan was to use the grid rehabilitation to attract outside investors and become a key node in a global fossil fuel economy mike henchen an expert in utility systems from the nonprofit rocky mountain institute said he s unaware of any utility in the u s that charges rooftop solar operators fees on the solar energy they consume themselves the policy conflicts with the renewable energy legislation henchen and others have pointed out which states that the system must facilitate and not hinder rooftop power producers ability to connect to the grid rieker the oversight board spokesperson told the intercept that the energy public policy act applies to prepa rates and wouldn t govern the junta s transition charge although the board thinks prepa should stop using expensive diesel it is agnostic about what kind of power the agency should substitute the charge for solar energy consumption is a matter of fairness rieker argued without that requirement customers who do not have the financial means to install their own energy generators or solar panels or customers who cannot install their own systems because they live in apartment buildings would bear higher costs he didn t mention that the charge would incentivize wealthier people to leave the grid entirely after which they would bear no transition fees at all marxuach called this typical bs from the board and pointed to a report from the consulting company london economics international that found that the transition charges will only speed up the decline in electricity demand increasing the burden on those forced to continue relying on prepa the lowest income puerto ricans overall marxuach takes a more conservative view than the queremos sol advocates he argues that placing solar on most of the island s rooftops could be a logistical nightmare and that puerto rico may need large solar arrays but he says the plans put forward by the government and the junta are both illogical hypothetically you could operate microgrids with a mix of energy which might include small natural gas plants he told the intercept but puerto rico is running on a shoestring budget and to be as efficient as possible natural gas plants have to be big and located on the coast so they can access imported liquid natural gas prepa s integrated resource plan does not account for sea level rise furthermore those plants work with a specific kind of grid marxuach said that forecloses in a way on the smaller producers connecting to the grid puerto rico simply does not have the resources to build out one energy grid only to replace it with another a few years later when renewable prices drop puerto rico will remain locked into a natural gas energy economy the tradeoff of doing it that way is the resilience component is not there marxuach said changing the facts on the ground both prepa s integrated resources plan and the debt restructuring plan still await approval yet natural gas infrastructure is already being built last march a groundbreaking ceremony was held in the capital of san juan for a facility that will deliver imported natural gas to two new generators for the san juan power plant soon afterward officials signed an agreement to widen the san juan harbor s channels allowing for bigger shipments of liquid natural gas at another plant in the san juan area called palo seco two new gas compatible generators have been installed and the government is in the midst of accepting bids for the construction of an entirely new gas fired plant on the west side of the island in mayagüez the conversion of another power plant to natural gas is underway my guess is their strategy is let s change the facts on the ground and once we get things started it will be hard to turn back marxuach said lydia díaz rodríguez helps manage a community farm in the devastatingly beautiful southeastern municipality of yabucoa lemon trees yuca and pineapple grow high on a mountain with a stunning vista of the turquoise sea if the government s plans come to fruition díaz rodríguez may someday have a view of a floating offshore lng import facility and a corresponding natural gas plant on land the yucae project which stands for yabucoa united for culture self management and ecology is a community farm in the southeast corner of puerto rico the agricultural and environmental group that runs it is organizing to stop the construction of natural gas infrastructure photos christopher gregory for the intercept for years díaz rodríguez pushed for chemical and fossil fuel companies operating in the area such as union carbide and sun oil to cut air emissions and water pollution and take responsibility for the rampant respiratory issues researchers had linked to heavy industry with the recession many corporations have since left we already paid our quota why do they want to sacrifice us again she wondered the organization she leads called the yabucoan committee for quality of life is holding community meetings and organizing to stop the natural gas infrastructure if anywhere is ripe for a popular movement around energy transformation it s puerto rico last july puerto ricans poured into the streets forcing rosselló to resign after the center for investigative journalism published private text messages revealing corruption as well as callous jokes about the bodies that had piled up in morgues after the hurricane the importance of the power grid and the unelected junta was lost on no one ricky resign and take the junta with you became a rallying cry it s a connection that will remain essential if the movement for renewable energy is to be successful after the earthquake unused hurricane relief supplies including dozens of cases of bottled water were discovered in a warehouse in the earthquake ravaged south propelling people into the streets yet again this time demanding the resignation of rosselló s replacement wanda vázquez but many of those present were aware of the limitations of that demand in the coming months the fate of congress s 2 billion in energy aid will be determined but it s not vázquez who will have the final say in where the money goes the funds will be overseen by a former banker named robert couch appointed by the trump administration and a team of 10 to 15 people newly dedicated to overseeing puerto rican recovery funds once a plan gets through the fossil fuel friendly administration it will also likely have to obtain approval from the junta to massol deyá it s an example of why the fight for energy independence is about more than just electricity we re calling for a goal of energy independence for puerto rico as a means to start decolonizing island he said massol deyá doesn t see casa pueblo s purpose as figuring out how to fix prepa but the natural gas infrastructure cannot be allowed to move forward he says this is forever if they let them do this this is a colony forever correction february 13 2020 a previous version of this article misspelled mayagüez and incorrectly described yabucoa as a northeastern municipality it is located in puerto rico s southeast the article has also been updated to clarify a statement from oversight board spokesperson matthias rieker
bloomberg versión en español carlos viloria came home to venezuela last month a 35 year old lawyer he d had enough of 15 hour days and abusive bosses as a restaurant worker in argentina for a year and a half one of more than 5 million venezuelans who ve left over the past five years hoping to escape one of the world s worst humanitarian catastrophes his return is also emblematic i m going to find a job that pays in dollars he said after leading his country s economy over a cliff president nicolas maduro has brought it a certain measure of stability by allowing dollars to flow freely and private enterprise to flourish in recent months he seems to have breathed new life into his regime he remains widely despised but emigration has begun to slow people are returning and the government is enacting laws to tax dollar transactions and allow companies to issue debt in foreign currencies all are signs that despite a triumphant world tour including a white house meeting with president donald trump opposition leader juan guaido is further away from ousting maduro than he was a year ago when he announced that plan and won wide international support help from allies at the time many wrote off maduro he had after all taken one of the region s richest countries and run it into the ground through corruption and colossal mismanagement then a year ago the u s smacked maduro with sanctions on oil his country took a big hit and many believed he couldn t survive but the doubters didn t realize how much help he d get from key allies to evade sanctions or how he d adopt a version of chinese style state capitalism the economies of the countries that have helped us are capitalist china turkey and india said david paravisini a lawmaker in venezuela s national constituent assembly associated with maduro to get their aid you need conditions of economic liberalism that s what china did to move forward it s what we have to do story continues the new approach includes secret talks maduro has had with holders of some 60 billion in bonds some of them american offering to pair them up with a foreign drilling company that would be granted the rights to oil fields as a means of their recouping debt venezuela has the world s largest known oil reserves and if this deal came to fruition many investors could reap enormous profits several who ve met with maduro recently say he s more confident than they ve seen him in a long time they spoke on the condition of anonymity elliott abrams the u s special envoy for venezuela disagrees why is this happening he asked reporters on thursday referring to the dollarization and privatization because their backs are against the wall worthless bolivar over the past year the u s dollar has become venezuela s unofficial currency appearing in cafeteria menus and mom and pop shop windows blocks from the presidential palace across the capital bodegas filled with french champagne vacuum sealed salmon and grana padano italian cheese appeared where bankrupt shops had once been the bolivar the official currency has become worthless through years of hyperinflation what we saw wasn t a liberalization but a permissiveness and in some cases a legal framework that existed but wasn t enforced said tamara herrera chief economist at caracas based consultancy sintesis financiera the need arose because of progressively intensifying u s sanctions the new decrees show the government s fiscal hunger and punitive nature oil production after plunging for nearly a decade is finally stabilizing at about 800 000 barrels a day stemming some of the economic hemorrhaging this year s projected contraction while still stunning at 10 is a far cry from the 35 a year ago and 65 in the past five years the country s constituent assembly approved a value added tax last month to reap benefit from the estimated 70 of all transactions this year set to occur in dollars until now the government hadn t collected vat on the dollar sales a lost opportunity to make up for a dramatic drop in revenue we are doing this now because there are signs that point to a recovery of the economy said jesus faria a socialist party lawmaker at the national constituent assembly but we have a highly speculative economy in which price fixers especially merchants take every opportunity to set and obtain extraordinary profits and incentives for national production must be created through more efficient policies price police this has meant an abrupt return to some statist socialism venezuela s price control agency said it inspected more than 1 900 stores in january commerce minister eneida laya recently said 135 agents had been dispatched across the country to end the speculative economy scrutiny had declined in recent months the government is watching closely again they came last week to tell us to cut our profits to 30 which we had to do but it hurt our business said maria luisa pereira who sells flour rice and condiments at quinta crespo market in western caracas how can we survive on so little with hyperinflation they hadn t been here in months and now they threatened us to come two more times in february we re afraid meanwhile fewer venezuelans are leaving according to two polling firms datanalisis and delphos in a december report from datanalisis those expressing a desire to leave the country fell to 38 down 5 points from a year before of those who ve emigrated in the past five years 17 or about 1 million have returned over the same period the data show maduro s government says it s overseen the return of more than 17 000 since 2018 through the come back to the fatherland plan the united nations still projects that this year the number of emigrating venezuelans will surpass the 6 million syrians who ve been driven from their homeland there s been an irony about the venezuelan emigration that the government knows but doesn t mention those who leave send remittances in dollars and also reduce the numbers needing to be fed and housed ecoanalitica a research firm says remittances have risen from 2 7 billion in 2018 to what it estimates will be 4 billion this year xenophobia luis vicente leon head of datanalisis said that the emigration of venezuelans has slowed recently not only because of new opportunities at home but because of new restrictions and xenophobic backlash abroad the barriers in those countries are increasing dramatically and make exit more difficult especially for those without visas or resources leon said also with the dollarization staying home seems to be less traumatic than emigrating viloria the lawyer who s just back from buenos aires said he found life there hard at the beginning they required me to work too many hours 15 hours a day sometimes and they paid me much less than the minimum wage he said i couldn t complain or i d get fired they made me stand for 10 hours straight i only had 15 minutes to eat and many times i had to eat standing he rented a small room in an apartment he shared with two others he also felt unwelcome often some of the argentine managers were xenophobic he said once they told a venezuelan partner that he had come from venezuela like a cockroach in venezuela we have water and electricity failures but at least i live in my house in argentina it s true that i could walk around safely at night and there are a lot of cultural events but i spent all my time working often being mistreated and the money wasn t enough i m putting my hopes in dollarization with assistance from fabiola zerpa ben bartenstein nicolle

on 29 january who director general dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus said that there was no reason to declare the outbreak of the coronavirus 2019 ncov in china a pandemic risk on 30 january he declared the virus an international emergency but made clear that there was no reason for countries to issue travel advisories against travelling to china let me speculate the international emergency was declared at the request of washington and the comment against the travel advisory was an addition by dr tedros himself as he realized that there was indeed no reason for panic that china is doing wonders in stemming the virus from spreading and in detecting the virus early on in fact dr tedros has himself as well as other high ranking who officials on various occasions praised china for her effort to contain the virus the speed with which wuhan population of 11 million capital of the center eastern province of hubei and china as a whole has reacted to the outbreak the latest achievement in 8 days china has built in wuhan a 25 000 m2 special hospital for treatment of the coronavirus 2019 ncov and possible mutations with 1 000 beds and for about 1 400 medical personnel for a budget of the equivalent of us 43 million equipped with state of the art medical technology no other country in the world would have been capable of such an achievement nevertheless and against who s guidance washington immediately advised its citizens not to travel to china and withdrew non essential staff from us consulates and the embassy in beijing thereby triggering an avalanche of similar reactions among washington vassals around the globe i e most of the european countries did likewise many of them canceled their flights to china as did of course the us russia also closed her 4 200 km long border working hand in hand with china in containing the virus this also means that no infected russian citizen may leave china this is a concerted chinese russian effort spearheaded by china to control and contain the epidemic the nyt and washpo are on a vicious daily campaign to slander and vilify china with lies and manipulated information on how badly china is managing the disease when the complete opposite is the case compare this to the common flu epidemic that hits the us and most of the western countries despite the fact that the us and europe have virtually implemented carpet vaccination in some us states and eu countries even compulsory yet this 2019 2020 flu season which is far from over has so far claimed more than 8 400 lives alone in the us more than 140 000 hospitalizations and more than 8 million infected people the us has about 330 million people compare this to china s 1 4 billion population with as of 3 february an infection rate of less than 21 000 a death toll of 425 in china and outside of china reported two one in hong kong another one in the philippines expand these statistics to europe and you find similar figures of course nobody talks about it this is an annual occurrence a bonanza for the western pharma industry in the west disease is business the more the merrier once you are in the medical mill it s difficult to escape specialists find always another reason to send you yet to another specialist for another treatment the ignorant patient has no option than to obey after all it s his health and life in china it is the total opposite the chinese system does everything for its population s health and well being yet china bashing in one way or another seems to intensify by the day yesterday 3 february the un in geneva has issued an edict that all un employees returning from china must stay home and work from home for 14 days i e a dictated self quarantine and new contracts for chinese staff will be temporarily suspended this is all propaganda against china quarantine is absolutely not necessary chinese biologists of the office of science and technology of the city of wuxi south eastern jiangsu province near shanghai have developed a test kit that can detect the 2019 ncov virus within 8 15 minutes similar to a pregnancy test this test kit is available to the world in fact it has been used to test an airline crew member arriving from new york at the zurich airport and feeling ill within less than an hour the crew member was sent home it was the common flu in china where by now scientific evidence is mounting that the disease like all the coronaviral diseases including the 2019 ncov predecessor sars severe acute respiratory syndrome 2002 2003 also in china and its middle east equivalent mers middle east respiratory syndrome are not only laboratory fabricated but also patented and so are many others for example ebola and hiv both sars and 2019 ncov are not only man made but they are also focusing on the chinese race that s why you find very few people infected in the 18 countries where the coronavirus has spread it sounds like a strange coincidence that in october 2019 a simulation with precisely the coronavirus was carried out at the john hopkins institute in the us funded by the bill and melinda gates foundation the wef world economic forum as well as the pirbright institute of the uk one of the world s few level 4 highest security level bio warfare laboratories for more details see china s coronavirus a global health emergency is launched what are the facts the west s demolition priority seems to have shifted drastically from russia to china why because china is an ever stronger economic power soon to surpass the united states in absolute terms since mid 2017 china is already number one measured by the ppp purchasing power parity indicator indeed the most important one because it demonstrates what people can actually buy with the money china s currency the yuan is also advancing rapidly as a reserve currency gradually replacing the us dollar when that happens that real money like the chinese yuan based on a hard economy and covered by gold against a fake fiat currency based on nothing like the us dollar is taking the lead then the us dollar hegemony is broken and the us economy doomed to prevent that from happening washington is doing everything possible to destabilize china see hong kong taiwan the uyghurs in china s western xinjiang province tibet the infamous trump inspired tariff war and now the new coronavirus outbreak the death toll is at present about 2 1 of total cases of infection down from 2 3 a week ago but that and the constant bashing with negative western propaganda travel bans border closures flight bans and more plus the disease itself the medical care work absenteeism medication and medical equipment not to forget the specially built 1 000 bed emergency hospital in wuhan and an 8 average decline at the shanghai stock exchange bear a considerable economic cost for china so much so that the people s bank of china pbc has recently injected some 1 2 billion yuan about us 174 million equivalent into the economy this new coronavirus 2019 ncov may just be a trial imagine a stronger mutation of a coronavirus would be implanted into the chinese population say with a mortality rate of 10 to 20 or higher it could cause real havoc however a stronger version may not be so easily controllable and directable i e towards the chinese race and may risk spreading to the caucasian race as well meaning the executioner would risk committing mass suicide remember the spanish flu pandemic of 1918 the deadliest in history infected an estimated 500 million people worldwide at that time about one third of the planet s population and killed at least 50 million people a death rate of 10 including some 700 000 americans while preparing for the worst because washington with the help of its level 4 bio war lab will not

the state and socialist strategy 9 the tightrope of socialist politics and governance in canada theory february 9 2020 marcel nelson obstacles dilemmas strategy one of the more persistent irritants amongst supporters of the new democratic party ndp has been its longstanding inability to replace the liberal party of canada lpc as the country s alternative to the different iterations of the conservative party of canada cpc this irritation has been amplified by the lpc s habit of campaigning with a left ish platform often scooping up ndp policies and then governing from the right at no time was this more apparent than during the 2015 federal election when the lpc overtook the ndp in part by tacking to the left while the ndp erred by moving to the center in a bid to consolidate the lead it had heading into the election a typical response by new democrats one that was on full display during the 2019 federal election campaign and since is to argue that the ndp is the real article and that it will actually implement programs like universal pharmacare and childcare if ever it were to be elected what is implicit yet increasingly explicit in this criticism of the lpc is that the reason for this deceit is the lpc s cozy relationship at an individual level with the wealthy and industry to be sure the lpc s interpersonal relationships with the powerful interests groups and the wealthy to say nothing of their overlapping worldviews is important in explaining why their governments often abandon their electoral promises nevertheless this line of criticism ignores important structural dynamics that explain in part why the lpc campaigns from the left and governs from the right these are structural dynamics that the ndp and any social democratic party would confront in proposing redistributional reforms in a period of neoliberal capitalism successfully passing and implementing policies such as universal pharmacare is not just a matter of putting in place different personnel in parliament at the helm of the executive branch with different convictions let alone different membership cards notably the ndp would face the same structural pressures the lpc does when it is at the helm and likely at a greater level given the perceived threat the ndp represents to canada s elites as well as their lack of interpersonal connections with said elites moreover that this amplified pressure would come not only from outside of the state from the media think tanks and business associations but also from inside the canadian state and its multiple jurisdictional levels this pressure is of course something that several ndp governments have faced and managed at the provincial level with different degrees of success and as often accommodation political transformation and the capitalist state in view of this the ndp and indeed the broader canadian left would benefit from further reflection on how best to deal with these structural pressures and specifically what needs to take place in terms of organizing before any socialist government is elected in order to resist these structural pressures simply stating that things would be different under an ndp or any left government in canada for that matter because of different personnel no matter the level of their ideological commitment to socialism is insufficient however difficult it may currently be to elect governments that adhere to a socialist program implementing such a program would likely be more difficult consequently the canadian left must be more realistic about the challenges it would face should it ever be elected being realistic as we will see would require a more radical strategy than the strictly parliamentary one currently on offer by the ndp the marxist political theorist nicos poulantzas developed a more realistic and radical strategy for transforming the capitalist state and the challenges it would pose for the ndp in pursuit of social reforms and as importantly for strategies for socialists working both inside and outside the ndp in canada the strategic relational theory of the state poulantzas wanted to dispel what he believed to be two erroneous approaches to the state that either posited it as being a thing or a subject where the state is viewed as a thing it is conceived of as being simply the instrument or passive tool of the dominant social classes where it is viewed as a subject it is seen as endowed with its own rationality and power and as able to act autonomously and arbitrate among competing social classes poulantzas 2008 283 at the heart of these two erroneous conceptions of the state fundamentally was the positioning of social classes and class conflict outside of the state as an externality this strategic relational theory of the state instead conceives of the state as a social relation and as such one that places class struggle emanating from the relations of production on the terrain of the state moreover these social relations are the main driver of changing state configurations importantly the institutional materiality of the state for poulantzas is not conceived of as a direct reflection of the capitalist mode of production or a simple instrument of capitalists instead he famously explained that the state is better understood as a material condensation of a relationship of forces poulantzas 2014 p 136 in other words the institutional materiality of the state apparatus and different formal and informal networks therein are shaped in a refracted form by class struggle what makes the capitalist state an interested class state nonetheless is that its central strategic agencies such as ministries of finance will tend to promote the interests of dominant fractions of the capitalist class poulantzas 2014 p 136 in the words of the political theorist bob jessop the state exhibits a strategic selectivity that favours the interests of powerful social actors understanding the state as a social relation has important ramifications for any movement and party that wants to carry out a socialist program or parts of one through the state notably the state is not an entity that can entirely be possessed or wielded instrumentally to serve specific interests not even entirely by the representatives of the ruling classes nor is it a neutral entity capable of serving the interests of a political community as a whole on its own beyond the strategic selectivity of the state left governments when elected must also face the reality that state institutional structure allows the bourgeoisie to meet a popular accession to power by permutating the sites of real and formal power poulantzas 2014 138 to previously secondary state institutions this can be achieved by using the judicial system or nominally symbolic institutions to impeach a government or block legislation think of the obfuscatory role the canadian senate might play if a government with a substantive socialist program were ever elected federally or by breaking the concentrated power at the summit of any state apparatus say for welfare provisioning to a lower level with more participatory and organizing practices with respect to the organization of the marginalized this implies that winning an electoral contest is but a first step in a broader long term struggle any government that seeks to implement a program that favours the interests of the working class and other subordinated groups must therefore do so through an institutional apparatus that is in part hostile to it for example one need only look to how civil servants from bc hydro and the energy ministry in conjunction with business groups outside of the state pressured the john horgan ndp government in british columbia to proceed with the site c project despite important questions regarding its benefits and environmental impact moreover more starkly and further afield one can look to the manner in which the judicial was weaponized in several latin american countries to constrain the policies of governments associated with the so called pink tide and even remove them from power via constitutional coups thus any government that runs amok of powerful interests no matter how benign the policy can potentially face opposition not only from outside the state within civil society but also within the state apparatus of the state as well this means that any political party that is serious about pursuing substantive socialist reforms must be prepared for the likely two pronged onslaught from inside and outside of the state that will follow their election any such government that relies solely on a parliamentary wing and existing state institutions will predictably and quickly find itself hamstrung by the realities of governing no matter how well meaning ethical or ideologically committed its members may be to frame this in the terms of the beloved t c douglas mouseland story if ever a government of mice were to be elected the governing mice would quickly be enticed to behave like cats as a result of the constant threat of being devoured by them this is because the state can be thought of as a house of cats where mice do live yes that has been built to meet the needs of cats above all else walking the tightrope of socialist governance despite the biased and contradictory nature of the state poulantzas nonetheless advocated pursuing socialism by moving through that very contradictory institutional field and seeking to modify it this can be contrasted with the leninist trotskyist dual power approach that seeks to create parallel structures outside of the state in the hope of eventually supplanting it for an interesting account of the difference between both strategies one can read an interview with poulantzas in a french trotskyist newspaper now governing through the contradictory and often hostile field of the state is obviously a challenge which poulantzas likened to walking a tightrope on the one hand implementing policies incautiously may lead to economic paralysis that could render a boycott in other words a capital strike by capitalists decisive poulantzas 2014 198 99 on the other hand not doing enough to implement a socialist program and or doing so too slowly may lead to the demobilization and disappointment of such a government s support base unsurprisingly social relations continue to shape the strategic field of the state and its policies even when socialist governments are in power for example fractions of the capitalist class can mobilize to make it difficult for such governments to borrow in money markets in order to fund their programs or meet their debt obligations this capacity is amplified with the tendency of leftist governments getting elected in the midst of economic crises one need only look to the recent experience of the former syriza government in greece as an example in canada the experience of the ontario ndp provincial government during the 1990s is a textbook example of the economic constraints that can be put up during an economic downturn to hamper a progressive government s agenda and how bowing to these constraints can demobilize its base parallel stories could be told of the lorne calvert and the greg selinger ndp governments in saskatchewan and manitoba respectively the high wire act of trying to avoid doing too much and not doing enough is an unavoidable challenge for all governments that seek a program of substantive reform nevertheless such governments according to poulantzas could broaden the tightrope they will have to negotiate by engaging a transformative dual tension that acts upon the simultaneous inclusion and exclusion of dominated classes and other marginal social groups from the state in united fronts of movements and parties in social struggles notably such governments as part of a broader social movement can do so by pursuing a political strategy of autonomy whereby they organize on the terrain of power within the state and outside of it by seeking to constantly maintain and deploy centres and networks at a distance from these apparatuses 2014 153 practically this means pursuing elected office and once elected trying to establish institutional centers within the state real centres of power on the strategic terrain of the state that represent the interests of the working class and other subordinated groups 2014 258 and on the other hand mobilizing forces outside of the state in an extra parliamentary manner on the whole this requires the simultaneous extension and deepening of the institutions of representative democracy and mobilization through participatory mechanisms so as to create popular centers of power embodying the interests of dominated classes outside and within the state such a strategy would enable socialist governments as part of a mass movement founded on broad popular alliances to better resist the dual onslaught of powerful interests within and outside the state 2014 258 62 moreover the productive tensions between socialist forces within and outside of the state and between representative and participatory mechanisms of democracy could serve to mitigate the pressure on the administrative and parliamentary wings of socialist parties to capitulate i e not do enough and fall into the trap of robert michel s iron law of oligarchy of bureaucratization of the party accompanied by gradualism in political strategy nevertheless employing such a strategy and taking on powerful interests head on does not of course inherently prevent capitulation or ensure the successful implementation of a socialist program notably poulantzas readily admitted that engendering such a process of change could lead to new crises and opportunities that may enable dominant classes to re assert themselves by different means 2014 256 64 one particular danger that he was keenly aware of was the possibility that excessive top down statism by a governing party in the state could be combined with shallow self management mechanisms in a way that distorts the legitimacy of the latter and of the socialist project as a whole 2014 196 one need only look to the experience of the venezuela s communal councils for an example of this type of danger furthermore this strategy does not ensure that effective policies will be implemented nor that that they will be implemented with technical proficiency finally given the global nature of capitalism dominant classes would retain the ability to mobilize economic and institutional resources located beyond the national scale to thwart such a strategy again all that poulantzas strategy of dual democratization promises is greater room to manoeuvre for socialist governments in order to implement economic and political reforms that can contribute to altering the overall balance of forces in the medium to long term poulantzas insights bring forth questions for both the so called activist wing of the ndp as well english canada s broader left and the party s establishment or insiders with regard to the future of democratic socialism in canada questions and challenges for ndp activists from the point of view of the activist wing the party s failings can be summed up by its resistance to internal democratization notably that the ndp establishment all too often relegates the party membership to the role of a passive cheerleader called upon for financial support and voluntary election work without being meaningfully consulted over the direction of the party in addition to this in a reflection on his membership in the party the historian ian mckay 2018 viii ix explains that the party all too often waters down it policies and rhetoric in a futile bid to gain middle class respectability and parliamentary prestige more damningly that in the absence of accountability to party members ndp governments have enacted neoliberal austerity policies such as the nova scotia ndp government of darrell dexter despite the mandate to do otherwise or that they have gone too far in compromising with powerful economic interests in a bid for stability in a way that betrays the party s purported policy goals such as the relationship between the party s position on climate change and energy policy during the alberta ndp government of rachel notley finally that when the ndp s moves to the center it impedes potential electoral success thomas mulcair s tenure as leader of the federal party represented the latest instance of policy moderation and electoral failure at the national level in view of this ongoing dissatisfaction with the party s establishment roberta lexier explains that there have been several major attempts notably the waffle movement during the 1970s the new politics initiative npi at the turn of the century the leap manifesto in the mid 2010s and more recently the courage initiative to transform the party in a way to make it more responsive to its membership 2018 111 212 the npi in particular was the initiative that came the closest to succeeding and was perhaps the closest to pursuing the strategy outlined in the previous section with its effort to combine social movements the party and unions into a new front that combine both parliamentary and extra parliamentary dimensions nevertheless these efforts were successfully thwarted by the very party establishment they sought to confront with the support of important swaths of the party membership at party conventions these historical experiences prompt important questions for the activist and socialist wings of the party as well as the broader english canadian left whether sympathetic or hostile to the ndp notably given the current electoral weakness of the ndp and the relative weakness of the broader left is it worth devoting precious resources and time to reform the ndp from within it to make it more democratic and left wing for example by building a reform movement within the party à la momentum in the labour party or then again by building a formal political organization outside of the ndp that is not a party yet operates both within and outside of the party in a bid to move it to the left such as with the democratic socialists of america and its strategic support for candidates that operate within the us democratic party like bernie sanders and the congressional progressive caucus importantly this is the strategy that is being employed and advocated by courage alternately might it be more effective to build an alternative party to the ndp for example by bringing together a collection of political and social movements into an electoral vehicle such as québec solidaire podemos in spain or syriza in greece a new party of course would not be obligated to imitate those examples and could set its own course in bringing together radical left forces outside traditional social democracy capable of advancing an anti capitalist perspective to be sure working within the ndp or building an alternative to it both have their advantages and disadvantages answering which approach might be more effective would necessarily involve identifying the factors that have made the ndp the central institution of the progressive left in english canada so resistant to previous attempts at internal democratic reform moreover it would involve identifying the degree to which these factors are irremediable or still in place this is a central question of strategy for the terrain of political organization but also of building united fronts of social struggle the ndp establishment ndp insiders and the wider establishment wing of the party conversely point to provincial victories as well as the period of internal reform and success that was achieved during jack layton tenure as the leader of the federal party between 2003 and 2011 david laycock and lynda erickson 2014 explain that the modernization of the federal party included the professionalization and the disentangling of fundraising efforts from the provincial wings the centralization and professionalization of election campaigns through a greater reliance on polling and a focus on the leader and greater centralization of the party structure through more careful management of party conventions by the party s administrative wing with the help of mechanisms such as the election preparedness committee epc much of these organizational and strategic innovations were drawn from the us democratic party it goes without saying that the reforms that took place during this period are anathema to the type of strategy advocated by poulantzas and has been derided by the activist wing of the party though it is largely credited by its advocates for contributing the 2011 federal election breakthrough the untimely death of jack layton in 2011 and the subsequent electoral failure in 2015 under the leadership of mulcair put into question the forward momentum of the modernization movement within the party mulcair was defeated as leader during a leadership review vote during a convention the following year the 2019 federal campaign witnessed a return to a more left wing platform under the leadership of jagmeet singh including a more unapologetic stance on increasing taxes on the wealthy this turn was no doubt helped in part by the growing prominence of american democratic socialist figures such as bernie sanders and alexandria ocasio cortez and developments in the british labour party under jeremy corbyn nonetheless party insiders largely remain in key positions of influence within the party and there has not been an effort to reform the party structures internally to make it more democratic and the electoral campaign itself in form and substance broke little new ground and failed to re assert the s word socialism into political discourse this of course is still far from answering the question of what the ndp might do to resist the blowback within and outside the state if it were ever to find itself forming government or even participate directly in a minority government what resources could it call on to withstand a capital strike for example to be fair singh is quite aware that instituting policies such as universal pharmacare would lead to significant resistance from powerful actors such as the pharmaceutical industry and even says so openly however he has not articulated what strategy would be deployed to resist such structural forces mobilizing left rhetoric effectively may lead greater electoral returns but it by no means provides answers on how to successfully govern from the left in a hostile environment a more realistic approach to governing as socialists requires more concrete answers to these types of questions but there are more fundamental questions too of political organization and strategy that the left in canada cannot avoid to capture some of the spirit of political experimentation and excitement animating socialist politics elsewhere works cited
it s onto new hampshire after the confusing and frustrating iowa caucuses which were marred by glitches in an app designed to count the results the democrats vying to be their party s candidate for the white house this november are turning their attention to the northeast on tuesday the granite state holds the first primary in the us a host of technology policies are among issues including health care climate change and immigration the candidates will be campaigning on in the highly polarized political climate it s often easy to overlook that there s a lot of agreement on broad tech concerns democrats and republicans agree online platforms like amazon google and facebook are too powerful and need to be reined in they also believe the digital divide between rural and urban america needs to be closed and that we need some net neutrality protections to ensure everyone has equal access to the internet here s a look at some of the positions candidates have staked out on tech issues we ll likely be hearing more about them as the primary season heats up online privacy there s consensus among democratic presidential candidates stronger protections are needed to ensure companies safeguard users personal information online in general they all agree there should be guidelines on how to handle that information and that companies should be held accountable when privacy policies are violated so far most candidates haven t gotten too detailed about their plans andrew yang a former tech entrepreneur has taken the most aggressive stance to date he believes personal data is a property right and he d like big tech companies that profit from personal data to share that money with their users in other words if companies like facebook and google make money off people s data they should be taxed and they should share that money with those whose data was mined president donald trump hasn t made many public comments about the privacy issue but his administration has been working behind the scenes meeting with big tech companies and trade groups to discuss the issue what s happening in congress congress has been working on legislation after months of bipartisan talks senate leaders released dueling privacy bills following the thanksgiving break but the bills have many things in common which should make a compromise doable the republican version of the bill introduced by sen roger wicker of mississippi is called the consumer data privacy act and would allow consumers to access correct delete and port data that companies have about them but it would also preempt state privacy regulations such as the one that went into effect in california earlier this year it gives the federal trade commission limited authority to regulate privacy but it wouldn t allow individual citizens to sue companies for violating privacy rights the democratic version introduced by sen maria cantwell of washington is called the consumer online privacy rights act and it gives the ftc greater enforcement authority unlike the republican bill this legislation would allow for individual consumers to bring civil suits to enforce the law meanwhile california s privacy law the strictest in the us went into effect on jan 1 that puts pressure on congress to pass some kind of federal legislation which could motivate democrats and republicans to work toward a compromise watch this can big tech actually be broken up 02 38 tech competition and antitrust the idea of breaking up internet giants like facebook has become fashionable in washington dc democrats running for president however have competing views on the issue sen elizabeth warren of massachusetts is the leader in the tech busting movement she s made the breakup of big tech companies like facebook amazon and google a cornerstone of her campaign she s compared these companies to big oil monopolies from the turn of the 20th century her plan calls for unwinding past mergers and passing legislation to prohibit companies from participating in markets where it also owns the platform such as how amazon can act as a seller on its online marketplace competing with other vendors sen bernie sanders of vermont also believes that big tech companies have too much power but he s stopped short of offering a detailed proposal about how to break up the tech companies he s cast his glance over at the broadband providers instead other 2020 presidential candidates such as former vice president joe biden pete buttigieg mayor of south bend indiana sen amy klobuchar of minnesota and yang agree that more regulation may be needed and the companies may have to be split apart but klobuchar is on the record as saying this is a decision for the department of justice trump has been sympathetic to the idea that companies like facebook should be broken up not because he fears their size and scale may violate antitrust law but because he views them as biased against him in june he told cnbc s squawk box that social media platforms like facebook and twitter discriminate against me twitter and facebook have said they don t discriminate against trump and other conservatives and their ceos met privately with trump last year what about regulators the ftc is pursuing several antitrust investigations into online platforms it s confirmed that it s looking into facebook s practices as well as others the justice department and state attorneys general are also investigating whether large tech firms such as facebook and google are abusing their market power more is likely to come out of these investigations in 2020 stay tuned rural broadband another issue that democrats and republicans agree on is that something needs to be done to connect the millions of americans living in rural areas who don t have access to high speed internet service the fcc reported that 21 million americans don t have access to broadband and given that pretty much everyone including the fcc agrees the broadband maps used to calculate this figure are wildly inaccurate there s a very good chance the number is much higher the problem is especially bad in rural communities it s created a great divide between the internet haves of the urban and suburban areas of the country and the rural have nots given that this is an issue that affects a large number of trump s base living in rural parts of the us democratic presidential candidates have taken notice in his high speed internet for all proposal sanders said the internet is a public utility and he wants to create a 150 billion grant and aid program for local and state governments to build publicly owned broadband networks he has also called for the breakup of large broadband companies such as at t comcast and verizon we are going to take on the greedy internet telecom and cable monopolies and put an end to their absurd price gouging sanders said in a statement warren and buttigieg said they plan to invest at least 80 billion in rural broadband warren hasn t gone as far as sanders in suggesting the breakup of big broadband companies but she s suggested that those companies be left out of subsidy programs and instead money should be given to local governments and publicly funded utilities to build new rural infrastructure biden said he supports getting more broadband to people in rural communities and he s proposed 20 billion to expand rural broadband trump has also shown concern over rural broadband last year the white house worked with the fcc to announce the rural digital opportunity program which reallocates 20 4 billion in funding from the fcc s existing universal service fund over the next 10 years to subsidize eligible companies to build out broadband infrastructure in underserved areas in april trump talked about high speed internet access as part of a 2 trillion spending plan on infrastructure he d hoped to work with democrats on but no deal was ever reached what about capitol hill it just so happens that democrats and republican in congress are also fired up about rural broadband issues the house passed two bills to help improve the abysmal maps used by the fcc in an effort to truly figure out where broadband does and doesn t exist this should help the fcc better allocate federal subsidies the senate is expected to harmonize these bills with their own and get them to trump for his signature net neutrality net neutrality or the idea that all internet service providers be treated equally so broadband providers can t favor their own content over a competitor is still a lightning rod issue dividing democrats and republicans this is despite the fact that most americans support the idea of having rules in place to protect the openness of the internet republicans say they re fine with that too but they don t want the fcc to have too much control over regulating broadband most of the democratic candidates have said they support net neutrality and will appoint fcc commissioners who will restore the old rules biden however is a potential wild card since he has a history of being a net neutrality skeptic also biden s first big fundraiser where he announced his candidacy was hosted by comcast s top lobbyist causing concern among net neutrality supporters trump is clearly a supporter of scaled back broadband regulation he appointed ajit pai a republican as fcc chairman he has spearheaded a clawback of the obama era rules what about capitol hill the disagreement over how net neutrality should be regulated has kept republicans in the senate from taking up a vote to restore the obama era net neutrality rules that were dismantled two years ago but democrats in congress and on the campaign trail largely seem to be united they want net neutrality back and while the issue hasn t gotten as much attention as others so far in this election cycle it s an issue that s directly affected by who s in the white house the reason the president appoints the fcc chairman and that party will control the fcc if democrats take over they can reinstate the old obama era protections china tariffs and huawei for more than a year the us and china have been entangled in a trade war trump has used tariffs taxes that importers in the us must pay when goods arrive from china as a tool to put pressure on the chinese government in september a 15 tariff on about 125 billion worth of goods went into effect an additional 15 tariff on products like phones laptops tablets and toys was set to take effect last weekend unless the us and china reached a deal another round of tariffs was avoided in a phase one trade deal with china that ll cancel new tariffs on chinese goods that were due to take effect in mid december the deal spares some popular devices such as apple s iphone and mac pro from tariffs that were expected to affect roughly 160 billion in imports from china the deal was signed in mid january trump has insisted that china pays the cost of tariffs economists say the actual burden falls on us businesses and then on consumers democratic presidential candidates have largely avoided the issue of trump s trade war with china instead they ve tried to sidestep an endless trade war that could damage the economy without appearing weak when it comes to china s trade practices meanwhile trump has conflated the china trade war with national security concerns around chinese telecom gear maker huawei trump has signed executive orders banning us companies from selling components to huawei and then he s lifted those bans as part of the trade negotiations what about capitol hill democrats and republicans in congress and on the fcc are taking a strong stand against huawei from a national security perspective and they re banning the use of huawei gear in government
