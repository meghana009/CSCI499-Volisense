getty images bring diversity to artificial intelligence by fei fei li artificial intelligence is the quest to build machines with human like intellectual capabilities but in an industry known for its struggles with representation how can we ensure they re inspired by the full range of human experience women make up only 12 of the ai research world and 26 of the tech workforce while people of color fill less than 20 of leadership roles my nonprofit ai4all is working to reverse this trend by bringing firsthand experience in university ai labs to students of high school age who often feel left out of tech girls ethnic minorities and residents of underserved communities ai is a vast frontier with far more to explore than any single person group or even nation can manage alone it will rank among

digital currencies a state backed token or perhaps an account held directly at the central bank could help ensure that remote and marginalized regions are included in the digital revolution and could help protect consumers without cash too much power could accrue to a small number of outsize private payment providers this is not science fiction central banks around the world are already considering these ideas including those in canada china sweden and uruguay of course challenges remain like risks to financial stability but as technology changes so must we lagarde is chair of the international monetary fund the above is an extract from a speech she delivered for the imf at singapore fintech festival who discover badly needed antibiotics by tedros adhanom ghebreyesus for almost a century antibiotics have made once deadly infections treatable and curable now we re losing them the rise of drug resistant bacteria is jeopardizing decades of progress threatening our ability to prevent and treat common conditions like pneumonia and urinary tract infections the causes are many including overuse and misuse of antibiotics in humans and animals but antibiotic resistance is also a market failure compared with other types of drugs antibiotics are not profitable for the pharmaceutical industry as a result there is a serious lack of promising new antibiotics in clinical development one innovative model to address that is the global antibiotic research development partnership gardp set up by the world health organization who and the drugs for neglected diseases initiative the partnership is developing new treatments on a not for profit basis through public private partnerships one new antibiotic showing promise is for drug resistant gonorrhea an infection that has failed treatment with last resort antibiotics in at least 10 countries if it works this partnership could be a model for how to increase access to and affordability of medicines which is key to achieving universal health coverage tedros is director general of the world health organization getty images connect everyone everywhere by mukesh ambani i believe no indian should be excluded from

saving children s lives by melinda gates perhaps the greatest achievement of the past generation is the fact that the number of children who die each year has been cut in half on my horizon in 2019 to make it possible to cut child mortality rates in half again over the past three decades the world has established a group of four organizations that have saved millions of lives you ve likely never heard of them but if you pay taxes you ve helped fund their success gavi has immunized more than 700 million children the global fund pays for hiv treatment for half the people living with the virus the global polio eradication initiative has pushed us to the brink of wiping out the disease the newest the global financing facility is focused on women s and children s health including helping women plan their families which means their children will be more likely to survive and prosper all four need new funding this year but some politicians in donor countries say they should invest less in the rest of the world will the world be able to cut child deaths in half again it depends on what they decide gates is co founder of the bill and melinda gates foundation getty images put a price on pollution for cleaner growth by justin trudeau pollution isn t free millions of people around the world are already paying its price in the form of catastrophic floods uncontrollable wildfires devastating droughts spreading disease and unprecedented forced migration we have to make a clean economy affordable for everyone and we have a moral and economic imperative to act now we are the last generation able to make sure future generations do not pay the full and incalculable cost of climate change we re also the first generation with the tools to do so pricing pollution is the single most powerful way to cut emissions while driving economic growth since putting a price on pollution in 1991 sweden has grown its economy and cut its emissions by 60 and 25 percent respectively here at home the four provinces with a price on pollution in 2017 led the country in economic growth while canada led the g7 in economic growth california hit its emissions reductions targets earlier and at a lower cost than anticipated after putting a price on pollution lower emissions cleaner air a stronger economy the science and economics behind pollution pricing are settled as of 2019 it is no longer free to pollute anywhere in canada in the international fight against climate change a national price on pollution should be the norm indeed it is already a necessity trudeau is prime minister of canada getty images teach children how to nurture the planet by jane goodall my greatest reason for hope for our future is the passion of young people when we listen to them and empower them the next generation is desperate to protect nature unfortunately so many children are unable to spend time in nature because of education systems rooted in technology and geared only to the demands of a materialistic world i began roots shoots in 1991 to provide young people of all ages with the opportunity to choose projects to benefit people animals and the environment today in some 80 countries groups are taking action to heal the harms we have inflicted they are for example planting endemic species to encourage biodiversity lobbying legislators about climate change raising money for victims of natural disasters volunteering in animal shelters it is desperately important to encourage them as they work to heal the scars we have inflicted and i urge philanthropists to invest in the education of young people to nurture the planet the challenges we face are daunting but nature is resilient the human intellect incredible so now as our youth joins forces to tackle problems we have created let us give them the support they need and help them in their fight to save the natural world on which we ourselves depend goodall is a primatologist and conservationist courtesy monsanto harness gmo crops to solve the food crisis by robert t fraley as someone who helped pioneer genetically modified crops i m proud to see how much good they have accomplished despite consumer fears the reality is gmo crops are safe and can help solve both the sustainability and food security issues our planet faces in the decades ahead by combining biotechnology with gene editing data science and digital tools it will be possible to improve all the world s crops i believe it s possible to not only double the food supply by 2050 but also to do it on less land than we farm today fraley is former chief technology officer at monsanto getty images commit to a clear goal on global temperature rise by christiana figueres in october 2018 the u n intergovernmental panel on climate change issued a special report commissioned by the world s governments to keep global temperature rise to well below 2 c while striving for 1 5 the impacts of global temperature rise caused by increasing co2 emissions have never been as clear nor action so urgent as we are quickly approaching tipping points of no return the decisions we take over the next two to three years are crucial for the unprecedented structural changes we must embark upon to safeguard our climate and clean up our air this is a make it or break it moment to help guide this decisionmaking here s one idea for a simple but powerful strategy hack that can be implemented across the board now that we know the difference between 1 5 c and 2 c of warming including twice as much physical damage twice as many people subjected to life threatening heat waves and fires we have one clear path to follow we must focus every effort on striving for 1 5 c let s enact a search and replace across all strategic documents including action plans emission reduction targets risk and opportunity assessments search for well below 2 and replace it with 1 5 then act accordingly it is not only the right thing to do it is the only prudent and prosperous course of action figueres is former executive secretary of the u n framework convention on climate change getty images use big data to help stop suicides and self harm by bernard j tyson the potential for data and analytics to be used in powerful new ways and improve the way health care is delivered is immense every year we learn more about how the digitization of health information can help people live healthier lives and make treatment more effective when they get sick already we are using these tools in cancer care to help ensure people get effective treatment we are using it to monitor and predict the developments of epidemics and disease outbreaks in real time and now we have the potential to apply it to an area i am particularly passionate about mental health and wellness my company kaiser permanente recently looked at whether we could use big data and machine learning to better predict the risk of self harm or suicide after mental health visits it turns out these risks are in fact more predictable than previously thought this kind of predictive analytics holds the promise of moving care further upstream with the potential to catch illness earlier and treat it more effectively if we can effectively harness the data we already have access to and apply it to our greatest challenges we will make incredible progress toward our ultimate goal of a healthier world tyson is chairman and ceo of kaiser permanente getty images empower girls with education by queen rania this year the world will celebrate the 30th anniversary of the convention on the rights of the child at the heart of which is a promise that children s rights are human rights yet as we take stock of that promise we must acknowledge that we have failed too many children especially the most vulnerable this inequity is most stark in the classroom where the right to education is still inexplicably and unjustly denied to millions of children who need it the most in my region protracted conflicts have uprooted children and disrupted their schooling for far too long as is often the case it is girls who pay the highest toll too many forced to swap homework for housework or worse school uniforms for bridal gowns the alchemic power of education is well documented when girls are educated they are empowered to make decisions that improve their lives and those of their families they become resilient and more likely to excel later in life we all have a role to play in realizing the promise we made to the world s children 30 years ago so my challenge to each of you is what will you do rania al abdullah is the queen of the hashemite kingdom of jordan getty images fight for sustainability now before it s too late by al gore the climate crisis is now a full blown global emergency the severity and frequency of climate related disasters are accelerating as is the risk of catastrophic disruptions to essential components of the earth s ecological balance that have enabled the flourishing of human civilization for the last 10 millennia the water cycle the pattern of wind and ocean currents sea levels the web of biodiversity the habitability of significant populated areas and much more fortunately we have the tools and technologies to solve the crisis the world is in the early stages of a global sustainability revolution based in part on our new found ability to achieve hyperefficiency in the use of energy and materials the emergence of abundant and cost effective renewable energy generation and storage electric vehicles sustainable agriculture and forestry techniques a circular economy that reuses waste streams as raw materials and other exciting advances new policies are needed to quickly manage a transition from the destructive approaches of the past to the sustainable approaches that are now available there s hope visionary nations businesses and investors and even more regional and local governments are pioneering new and promising policies time is running out a rising generation around the world is demanding change and leading the sustainability revolution we must respond to this calling and act like our world depends on it because it does gore the 45th vice president of the united states is founder and chairman of the climate reality project getty images transform how we create buildings by bjarke ingels for the last thirty years while productivity in manufacturing has increased productivity in the construction industry has flatlined the way we plan and design buildings has become more accurate but the way we build the way we translate our data into matter has remained the same it s still done with a hand and a hammer now we re at a moment where the computer aided construction tools that we know from the manufacturing industry 3d printing tools and the deployment of robots for example are about to transform the built environment when you are building a normal building with normal materials a rounded corner is an added expense it requires more effort more time more smoothing it s more difficult to make but when you are 3d printing making a rounded corner is actually cheaper because it uses less material and it s sturdier because it doesn t have any hard edges that may chip when 3d printing is widespread a straight wall will take the same amount of time as a curvy wall it sounds simple but it will unleash an explosion in quality and productivity you can make an almost infinite variety and amount of ornamentation aside from the creative opportunities there are enormous environmental implications if you ve ever been to a construction site you will see a tremendous amount of waste because of the inaccuracies of human craftsmanship and the lack of precision in the translation from data to matter when that translation happens from a computer aided design file to automated construction you will have much much much less waste in the construction process ingels is a danish architect and founder of bjarke ingels group big getty images be bolder in how we invest in the future by mariana mazzucato economic growth has not only a rate but also a direction while some countries are still craving pre crisis growth rates we should be aiming for growth that is more inclusive sustainable and driven by innovation yet rather than providing long term finance to stimulate creativity and investment in industry finance has become more short termist and speculative focused only on financing other parts of the financial sector like insurance and real estate meanwhile the industry itself has become overly financialised the fortune 500 companies have spent nearly 3 trillion in share buybacks in the last decade intended to boost share prices stock options and executive pay imagine the opportunities if the danger of climate change were turned into a positive roadmap for investment and innovation across the entire economy but the pressure should not only be on business the public sector must renew its courage to act in mission oriented ways setting the direction for change through bold investments in areas that increase business expectations a moon shot approach whichi have been advocating in the european union to key problems around energy health and the future of mobility could help make this happen as in the case of the it revolution governments need to provide the lead setting clear goals and using government instruments from prizes to procurement to crowd in investment from public private and third sector actors fundamentally this will also require a new confidence within public institutions to see themselves not just as market fixers and redistributors of value created in business but as active co shapers of markets and co creators of value professor mariana mazzucato is the director of ucl s institute for innovation and public purpose iipp and the author of the value of everything making and taking in the global economy courtesy ikea 2 tackle pollution with innovative ideas to clean air by lena pripp kovac and torbjörn lööf around the world nine in ten people live in places where air pollution exceeds safe limits we know that ikea operations can sometimes impact air quality and as part of our efforts to become climate positive across our value chain we are focusing on clean air as well as developing solutions to help clean the air in people s homes from curtains made of an innovative air purifying textile to affordable filtration devices we are exploring initiatives that can make an even bigger impact in new delhi india for example we are pioneering a way to use waste as a resource after the harvest each year rice straw a by product usually considered waste is burnt contributing to the city s historically poor air quality under our better air now initiative we are turning new delhi s rice straw into a renewable material for ikea products that means improved air quality and a new source of income for smallholder farmers we ve already created the first prototypes from the new materials decorations and paper boxes which will be on sale in ikea stores in india by 2020 and we aim to roll out the initiative to other megacities around the world to create a true impact on air pollution we need commitment from every group in society including businesses individuals ngos and policymakers working together to make lasting change pripp kovac is ikea s head of sustainability and lööf is chief executive of inter ikea group getty images reskill the workforce for the age of ai by james manyika artificial intelligence and automation technologies have made huge advances over the past few years to the point where machines can now exceed human capabilities in certain areas this will have dramatic implications for the world of work the big question is whether workers will be able to acquire the skills needed to adapt and meet the demand for skills many of which will involve working alongside machines education and worker training and retraining are thus emerging as the key challenge of our era our education systems will need to be rethought to emphasize not just technological skills but also to hone social and emotional and higher cognitive skills that are intrinsically human skills such as initiative taking empathy creativity and critical thinking for midcareer workers and for the companies where they work adaptability will be the new watchword for now large scale reskilling initiatives are the exception if we are to thrive in a more automated future we need not only to talk about lifelong learning but to put it into practice at scale and quickly james manyika is a senior partner at mckinsey company and chairman of the mckinsey global institute mckinsey s business and

it also requires immense amounts of fresh water and wreaks havoc on the world s ecosystems at the same time daily meat consumption is also a key factor in cardiovascular disease and obesity it s clear consumer behaviour has to change that will be difficult but a mix of organic carrots and recycled sticks ought to do the trick for starters industrial scale meat production is increasingly being exposed for the damage it does as a result many who can afford it have started looking for organic local sources of meat but change on a global scale will take time eliminating harmful subsidies and putting a price on externalities will have to be part of the solution the other part is innovation alternatives to meat are abundant and dare i say it quite tasty by the 2020s production of so called clean meat will reach increasing scale full disclosure i m an investor while the market for meat free substitutes is already growing rapidly this will keep prices down and allow everyone to make better healthier choices that are good for the planet too branson is the founder of the virgin group getty images take gender equality in the workplace seriously by saadia zahidi let s use this moment of flux in labour markets to hardwire gender equality into the future of work i d like to see all companies commit to recruiting equal numbers of men and women for their five highest growing occupations within 3 years we must continue current efforts to retroactively fix problems that have been decades in the making but we also need such measures to prevent future problems especially when it comes to stem skills based roles we need a proactive measure like this for example currently only 23 percent of global ai talent is composed of women not only can we change this but we can change

crippling cost of higher education by jared polis at 1 4 trillion student loan debt weighs down nearly 43 million student loan borrowers nationwide never before have so many who are so young owed so much with the amount of money given away to international corporations through tax reform we could have wiped out all student debt from the books and freed millions of americans to pursue their dreams getting an education should help students achieve their goals it shouldn t be a barrier to goals like getting a home starting a family or saving for an emergency to reduce the skyrocketing cost of college and subsequent debt we have to think about everything from tuition to textbooks we were able to chip away at costs earlier this year when the u s congress finally approved a 5 million allocation to expand access to free open source textbooks many of which are online the move was modeled after the bipartisan affordable college textbook act which i drafted after getting feedback from local colleges and universities it ll go a long way but there is still more left to do congress will this year consider passing legislation to educate students on loans the know before you owe act i introduced before leaving the house of representatives would help protect students from predatory private student loan lenders it would require schools to counsel students before they sign on to expensive private education loan debt and inform them of any unused federal student aid eligibility education truly is the single most important investment we could make in our collective future and there is bipartisan agreement we all benefit when it is accessible and affordable for everyone polis is the governor of colorado getty images begin the process of ending private car ownership by dara khosrowshahi as more people have come to rely on uber our technology has become an important part of the transportation fabric of cities what started as a more reliable way to get a ride has evolved into a global marketplace powering 15 million trips a day with that comes a responsibility we are in a unique position to have a meaningful and positive impact on the cities we serve our ultimate goal is one we share with cities making it easier to live without owning a personal car achieving that goal stands to improve urban life by reducing congestion pollution and the need for parking spaces to get there we ve begun to bring multiple modes of transportation together within the uber app so that our customers can choose the fastest or most affordable way to get where they re going whether that s in a car on a bike on the subway or more we believe that by offering many reliable ways to get from point a to point b personal cars can ultimately be replaced by apps like uber technology on its own is not a solution for urban problems but done right and in partnership with others we believe technology has the potential to contribute to a better world for all khosrowshahi is chief executive

by tomoo kikuchi and masaya sakuragawa many have said that the 21st century will be the asian century asia s weight in the world economy will rise to account for over half of global gdp by the mid century the primary question is whether the asia s economic dominance in the world translates into the leadership in technology institutional quality or soft power this article focuses on the leadership in the global financial system china and japan became the second and third largest economies in terms of gdp by benefiting from free trade and relying on the us dollar system the current trade war between the united states and china is a result of unbalanced contribution to supplying international public goods this is the very point at which china and japan need cooperation to create the autonomous institutional environments in asia china and japan should pursue greater cooperation on a number of fronts from economic development to international trade and currency internationalization this will be no mean feat for two nations whose historical enmities still lie in fresh in their cultural memories while political relations have been testy to say the least it is worth remembering that bilateral trade and investment have nevertheless kept china and japan closely integrated in recent decades the figures below show that japan has been china s second biggest trading partner for most years from 2006 to 2016 while china replaced the us to become japan s biggest trading partner in 2007 china s top trading partners total trade usd billion source general administration of customs prc japan s top trading partners total trade jpy 100 billion source ministry of finance japan beijing s catchphrase of the new normal sacrificing rapid economic development for slower growth of a higher quality cannot fully account for the slowdown being logged in china s economy china is undergoing the unfamiliar and likely lengthy rebalancing process from an export to consumption led economy typical of many of the world s recently developed nations the figures below show that china s export growth has stagnated in recent years despite the chinese yuan losing value against the us dollar china s export usd billion and us dollar to chinese yuan exchange rate source un comtrade database and international monetary fund now is an opportune moment for japan and china to accelerate economic integration especially as the wave of anti globalization washes over the industrialized world this can be best seen when we compare the foreign direct investment fdi in both china and japan the figure below shows that fdi into china has been facilitated by hong kong and other offshore financial centers such as the virgin islands singapore and cayman islands this reflects the closed nature of china s capital market beside those offshore centers japan has been the largest source of capital for china and the opening of its capital market will certainly accelerate japan s investment in china foreign direct investment stock up to 2017 to china usd billion source ceic on the other hand the figure below shows the stock of fdi in japan china is absent from the top ten list but clearly has potential to become a major investor in japan especially as the us and europe increasingly perceive china s investment as a treat to their national security foreign direct investment stock up to 2017 to japan jpy 100 billion source ministry of finance japan integration does not have to begin at the level of nations either but on a localized scale the ongoing euro and refugee crises and most recently brexit have demonstrated that finding a definite policy direction among member states is often fraught with obstacles says sahoko kaji of keio university whether or not the asian continent could even tolerate such a model of regional integration is debatable instead kaji argues china and japan could identify regions and cities as special zones to kickstart and experiment with the integration process scaling up at a later stage one key opportunity of cooperation is infrastructure development which the asean member states have applied to great effect as they leverage their position on global value chains the ever increasing demand for infrastructure investment in the region is attractive for both china and japan china faces diminishing returns on investment at home and japan s market is shrinking relative to the rest of the region due to its declining and aging population to realize the potential of infrastructure investment in the region china is going to have to get a grip on its bloated soes which risk inefficient resource use in infrastructure provision japanese companies meanwhile need to become more competitive globally according to blake h berger program officer at the asia society policy institute effective integration of economic goals in the region would be catalyzed through a merging of the headline developments currently being pushed namely china s belt and road initiative the asean economic community and the master plan on asean connectivity although asean have been the engines driving regional integration berger argues the success of multilateral development programs is contingent on the involvement of china and japan s contribution the sino japanese rivalry and quest for regional influence was actually a catalyst for asean s institutional upgrading and expansion including the development of the asean 3 macroeconomic research office and the chiang mai initiative multilateralization competition and cooperation in the leadership between the asian development bank and the asian infrastructure and investment bank can eventually contribute to regional integration and infrastructure development both china and japan run trade surplus with the united states the trade is predominantly invoiced in the us dollar and the surplus is invested in the us dollar denominated assets making china and japan dependent on the us dollar system currency is power the united states could lessen its debt burden by depreciating the us dollar unilaterally in the same way when the us dollar was depreciated against the currencies of major exporters to the united states after the plaza accord thirty years ago the establishment of the common currency euro needed cooperation between germany and france in the same way china and japan need to cooperate to establish an autonomous currency area in asia the first step could be achieved through the establishment of a multi currency clearing system in asia msca japanese economist masaya sakuragawa believes that previous attempts for asian monetary integration have not gone far enough the current asian bond markets initiative is not very effective because it does not facilitate currency clearing an mcsa would eliminate settlement risk for securities and currencies and increase cross border financial transactions says sakurgawa with china and japan s enormous foreign reserves as a liquidity backstop in multiple currencies an msca could pave the way to full monetary integration in asia savings in the region that are still predominantly channeled to purchase government bonds and equities in the us and europe could then be cycled into investment in asia whether or not we are at the start of an asian century the outsized role of east asian economies in coming decades is beyond question at the center of this emerging might guiding its direction and determining its impact on the global economy will be the incumbent market leaders china and japan it is in the world s interest therefore to support closer ties between these two nations tomoo kikuchi is associate editor of the journal of asian economics and visiting senior fellow at the s rajaratnam school of international studies masaya sakuragawa is professor of economics at keio university their book china and japan in the global economy is a comprehensive treatise on this relevant and dynamic field

on jan 21 the qatari government announced it would buy 500 million worth of lebanese government bonds the news briefly reassured markets that have been negatively affected over the past eight months as lebanese politicians have failed to form a new government but several hours after the qatari announcement moody s one of the three main american credit rating firms downgraded lebanon s credit rating making it riskier to hold by investors the move heightened concerns about lebanon s financial health and injected fresh uncertainty into financial markets the following is l orient le jour s guide to understanding different aspects of the debate on lebanon s uncertain financial climate the heart of the issue a growing public deficit the current economic slowdown began in 2011 following the start of the conflict in syria and as wealthy foreigners from the gulf left lebanon the lebanese government found it increasingly difficult to make ends meet due to a downturn in the private sector that negatively affected the amount of tax revenue it has been able to collect in 2011 the state brought in 8 8 billion in tax income compared to 8 billion by end of september 2018 meanwhile the state s spending rose from 11 6 billion in 2011 to 13 2 billion by the end of september 2018 the increase in the state budget is primarily due to spending in three areas the payment of lebanon s debt salaries and wages for public administration and transfers from the treasury to electricité du liban to bridge its deficit as a result the public deficit which was 2 3 billion in 2011 rose to 4 5 billion by the end of september 2018 and according to several experts will likely exceed 6 billion when the data comes in for the end of 2018 why are banks directly affected to cover the growing deficit the state has needed to borrow more and more money as a result the public debt grew from 54 billion in 2011 to 83 6 at the end of october 2018 in lebanon local banks lend money to the state either directly by buying treasury bills in lebanese pounds or eurobonds in us dollars they can also lend money indirectly by making deposits to lebanon s central bank the bdl that will then be used to buy government bonds to continue to finance the state banks rely on a continuous inflow of deposits but deposits have been slowing down as the need to finance the debt has increased the inflow of deposits mainly comes from remittances sent by lebanese living in the diaspora but these are slowing down for two reasons the gulf crisis and a lack of trust by expatriates in the sustainability of lebanon s financial system because of political tensions and geopolitical instability between 2008 and 2011 bank deposits grew by an average of 17 percent per year since then the growth has slowed in the first eight months of 2018 bank deposits only grew by 3 percent what is the link between the formation of a government and cedre a government needs to be formed to stop the growing public deficit and restrain the demands of financing the state s debt state spending will need to be lowered and its revenue increased lebanon committed to making these reforms during the cedre conference in paris last april and they were put forward in reports by several international organizations as the only way out of the crisis to increase its revenue the state will need to combat tax evasion and improve tax collection or raise taxes once again to lower its spending the state will have to introduce reforms in the three main areas of expense mentioned above the public sector will need to be reformed by cutting useless jobs that were created in the service of political clientelism new power stations will need to be constructed and rates increased and the amount of money spent on servicing the public debt will need to be decreased the last reform appears to be the most feasible in the short term because it will allow the state to buy time to implement other reforms and delay the possibility of payment default payment default would negatively impact the state s main lender the lebanese banking sector and the banking sector s depositors the lebanese citizens what are the main options to reduce debt servicing there are different options available to reduce the burden of servicing lebanon s debt the newspaper al akhbar published an article quoting outgoing finance minister ali hassan khalil as raising the possibility of an imminent restructuring of lebanon s debt which heightened tensions in the market the minister quickly denied the report and explained the he was talking about rescheduling the debt not restructuring it what s the difference debt rescheduling means that the state renegotiates the terms of its debt with banks by lowering interest rates and postponing the maturities paying them in ten years instead of five for example a debt restructuring means that the state negotiates with banks to scale down the principal also known as haircut which means the amount of loaned capital not only the interest in this case banks will deal with huge losses that will directly impact account holders the state might accept to reschedule the debt to prevent this scenario the state could also choose to devalue the lebanese pound in relation to the us dollar to lower the size of its debt in pounds and increase the state s income despite speculation about this move bdl governor riad salamé has firmly ruled it out as a possibility we hear talks about devaluation but as the economy is dollarized we have no interest in abandoning the stability of the exchange rate because it will harm our productivity and purchasing power without it helping our competitivity he said in december high economic growth would also pave the way for increased state tax revenues but financial forecasts rule out this possibility the bdl expects a growth rate of between 1 and 1 5 percent for 2018 and the world bank and imf project a growth rate of around 1 percent as stated by many experts the rapid formation of a government would help avert the most pessimistic scenarios this article was originally published in french in l orient le jour the 23rd of january
topshot an anti brexit activist waves a union and a european union flag as they demonstrate outside the houses of parliament in central london on january 23 2019 britain s main opposition labour party has proposed mps be allowed to vote on a second referendum as part of a series of options to stop a no deal brexit photo by daniel leal olivas afp photo credit should read daniel leal olivas afp getty images british politics is regularly said to be at a critical juncture with brexit this is for once not hyperbole it represents the most significant moment of political choice and potential rupture since the second world war and in peacetime possibly since the repeal of the corn laws in the 19th century for four decades membership of the european union eu and its predecessors has shaped the evolution of britain s model of democratic capitalism it has anchored the uk s economic policy framework governed the uk s trade restructured british manufacturing and its supply chains and helped attract foreign direct investment into the country the city of london has been transformed since the 1970s to serve the eu as well as global markets european companies now supply many of britain s utility needs from energy to rail and bus transport eu membership is even built into our hard infrastructure most obviously through the channel tunnel the supply of migrant labour from the eu particularly since 2004 has greatly altered the uk s workforce transforming a number of sectors like retail hospitality care and food processing other industries like agriculture and fisheries have been fundamentally reshaped by common eu policies the impact of the eu extends far beyond economics however british society has a different make up and look and feel due to eu membership the population and the places in which it lives and works has become more european several generations horizons sense of mobility and travel patterns have been greatly broadened social and environmental policies from annual holiday rights to clean beaches have rested on eu initiatives the uk s place in the world and foreign policy has been moulded and moderated by our membership our legal system and the very form of statecraft pursued by the british state has been transformed it is no exaggeration to say that the european project has re made us yet to present this simply as a story of disruption and transformation would be to mislead there are deep continuities too there is a uk pre history to eu membership that has also endured not least in our political economy much of which is rooted in the victorian era the uk is a liberal market economy with a global financial sector deregulated labour market shareholder dominated corporate governance and an education system with a strong bias against vocational skills in favour of generic ones entry to the common market in 1973 helped cement the structures of this british liberal market economy rather than fundamentally reforming it along coordinated or social market european lines the uk did not leave its economic past behind when it joined the european project the role of the state in the economy was significantly reduced as well as reformed in the 1980s and the postwar growth model of an export orientated national economy with significant domestic manufacturing energy and food production was progressively dismantled but the underlying institutions of the uk liberal market economy remained in large part intact throughout these transformations they evolved in tandem with a political system dominated by two main parties and a liberal welfare regime of mostly flat rate benefits and significant means testing rather than the multi party politics of proportional voting systems and social insurance or universalist models of

future marketing communications thank you close as it entered the new millennium the uk was an open financialised economy deeply integrated into european markets with a growth model underpinned by consumption and an oversized housing sector high value service exports and foreign direct investment helped to offset a persistent deficit in manufactured goods to be sure this growth model had formidable strengths competitive advantages in knowledge based sectors a buoyant labour market drawing in highly skilled migrants and productivity gains driven by leading edge service companies and world class universities and research but these were matched by chronic failings weak investment entrenched inequalities between people places and generations a dystopian housing market and rampant insecurity in segments of the jobs market among others when the uk was battered by the financial crisis in 2008 it exposed economic fault lines that had been obscured by the long era of benign growth in the 1990s and 2000s they became even more visible and acquired greater public consciousness following the brexit referendum despite the gains made before the crisis levels of uk productivity remained comparatively low and remarkably have now barely improved for a decade real wages are still significantly below pre crisis levels and longstanding inequalities of income and wealth between both the regions of the uk and its social classes show little sign of diminishing as a nation the uk continues to rely in the words of the governor of the bank of england on the kindness of strangers to pay its way in the world a new and darker global context also overshadows the withdrawal of the uk from the eu the protectionist america first agenda of donald trump reverses 70 years of us commitment to an integrated europe and has already engendered geo political division over tariffs the role of nato and the eu s relationships with russia and iran in tandem with this we ve witnessed the rise of nationalist and neo fascist parties both within the eu and outside it who share a common hostility to internationalism at a time when the looming crisis of climate breakdown demands urgent global action brexit arises at a moment when the postwar institutions of the international community are under huge stress at the level of domestic policymaking withdrawal from the eu presents a series of discrete challenges such as how to handle a range of repatriated powers each policy area is important but if our analysis is narrow focussing on a set of single issues we risk missing the bigger shifts hence in this book we address brexit in the context of the impending challenges of the 2020s and beyond we situate the question of leaving the eu and what it could mean in the larger sweep of the outlook for democratic welfare capitalism in the uk the leading contributors to this special volume range widely across politics economics social policy and democratic and constitutional reform while the book as a whole seeks to connect the domestic situation of the uk with its external position both economic and geo political at the time of writing january 2019 the politics of brexit remain radically uncertain a number of scenarios theresa may s proposed deal leaving the eu without a deal a soft brexit an agreed extension of the article 50 process or a second referendum with the option of remaining in the eu are all still possible for the most part the contributions to this book are predicated on some form of withdrawal from the eu taking place in the years ahead but beyond that the scope for analysis and interpretation remains very wide and the chapters consequently contain diverse perspectives on what has caused the brexit rupture in british politics and what its consequences might be the political causes of brexit to make sense of the vote to leave the eu we need to unpack both the moment in history in which it occurred as well as the coalitions who supported it the timing of the vote was inauspicious from a remain perspective not only did it take place amid the worst decade of pay growth since the napoleonic wars the deepest austerity in modern times and in the shadow of the eurozone crisis it also occurred when broadly eurosceptic baby boomers were at their electoral peak while the more pro european silent generation of the war years was in steady decline and their younger more remain minded cohorts were yet to reach their full electoral potency economically as well as electorally it represented a truly reckless moment for a remain supporting prime minister to seek to settle the european question but whatever the timing the referendum fundamentally pivoted around the creation of an alliance of older conservative middle class voters and the semi skilled and unskilled working class a combination of what david willetts has called the insulated and the excluded political discourse about the referendum has been dominated by the plight of so called left behind voters yet in reality older relatively prosperous voters were just as significant in number reflecting the uk s marked inequalities in voter turnout by age the referendum result therefore represented a reckoning with places that have never recovered from the shock of de industrialisation and thatcherism as well as groups who have not been reconciled to the ascendance of ever greater social liberalism and the cosmopolitan remaking of britain or the european remaking of the british state for those reasons the outcome of the vote is difficult to explain in terms of the dominant political economic interests in the productive economy the city of london the major business organisations and the trade unions all supported remain as did the main political parties the leave vote disproportionately came from interests outside the labour market older voters with a foundation of housing and pension wealth or the state pension and pensioner benefits and those struggling precariously within it like the low skilled and self employed its campaign was led by a political and economic elite even if it was an unconventional one drawn from beyond the organised pillars of the economy but it successfully channelled an eruption of politics against the established political economy it shook to its core the world view that the big contours of the uk s economic policy were firmly set and resided outside the reach of democratic contest and it forced attention if not public policy upon an economic trajectory that had so unevenly distributed the gains of growth over the last four decades other drivers of the referendum vote are perhaps easier to grasp the young and middle aged and the better educated were far more inclined to vote remain these are the social groups most comfortable with immigration and the diversity of modern britain the geography of the referendum reflected this pitting most of the major urban centres and university cities against the towns countryside and coastlines majorities in scotland and northern ireland voted remain while most of england and wales opted to leave this political geography is new in 1975 none of the uk s constituent nations voted no to eec membership and england and wales recorded the largest supporting majorities while these headline territorial patterns are striking consideration needs to be given to differences within regions and how they interact with the effects of age look for instance at retired voters in a strongly remain region like london and we see that they backed leave in similar proportions to the retired of yorkshire the north west or wales equally if we just consider those in work we see that remain won in more nations and regions of the uk than leave brexit has certainly fractured the electorate in important ways but it is a far more complicated picture than london scotland and northern ireland versus the rest of england and wales the brexit juncture comes in a new era of uk politics it marks the first real crisis of politics in the post devolution era in which the uk has become formed as a multi national state not just in terms of its governance but in its identity too formal decisions concerning brexit reside with the westminster parliament but the consequences ripple across the uk s nations and their assemblies parliaments and civil societies the european question has layered another deep cleavage onto the already fractious territorial politics of the union the consequences of brexit political economy over the last 40 years britain has sought consistently to entrench its liberal market model within the eu pursuing the creation and completion of the single market while for the most part resisting delorsian ambitions to embed european capitalism in a pan european social democracy its period of membership may have often been grudging but it has also been consequential the decision to leave the european project can therefore be expected to alter the future trajectory of the eu but what might it mean for the future political economy of the uk will it essentially be a story of continuity or should we see dislocation will it be the same but worse or is this the start of something very different when it comes to the uk s growth model it is hard to see where a significant re orientation will come from the major devaluations of sterling over recent years one following the 2008 crisis the other after the brexit vote have not spurred export growth but have reduced real wages if nothing else they have exposed the contemporary hollowness of the age old hope that a weaker currency will prove to be an elixir for british manufacturing a surge in export led growth in the years ahead seems highly unlikely if the uk ends up outside the single market and customs union there will inevitably be new frictions in trade with britain s biggest market while any new trade deals with other countries will be time consuming involve sharp trade offs and are likely to generate only negligible gains in gdp compared to the expected losses arising from diminished access to the eu financial services on which the uk relies heavily for export performance are likely to shift a significant proportion of business to the eu gravity is not so easy to defy a new era of wage driven growth feels unrealistic too even now at a mature stage of the economic cycle and in the face of a tight jobs market pay rises remain anaemic by postwar standards without a turnaround in productivity wage growth will remain weak as will household income growth all of which is a major constraint on the consumption led uk growth model business investment too is not well placed to come to the rescue the uk s long running problem of weak investment has if anything intensified in the post crisis era and now brexit uncertainty represents a major additional drag on business sentiment public investment is increasing substantially but not at a rate sufficient to transform the overall outlook the engines of demand in the uk economy have been slow to recover since the financial crisis and have been further weakened by the prospect of brexit this will place more strain on macro economic policy it is unlikely the uk will return to anything like normal monetary policy in the immediate future fiscal pressures are set to ease relative to the deep austerity of recent years but this is only likely to mean that spending keeps up with inflation rather than recovering any of the ground lost after 2010 and history suggests that before too long even leaving aside any disruptive shocks we should anticipate another recession or slow down a new phase of policy activism may well be needed before the last phase has been wound down brexit and the welfare state between 1997 and 2010 new labour pursued a social investment strategy fleshing out the uk s liberal welfare state with new spending on tax credits childcare investment in education and skills and a major expansion of higher education poverty fell inequality levelled off and income mobility rose these were major social achievements though for many post industrial towns and cities they never amounted to the creation of a viable new economic future what appeared for a while to be a durable electoral coalition of the working class and middle class socio cultural professionals underpinned this policy shift but has since fragmented this period of growth in our welfare state was followed by sharp retrenchment after 2010 with deep cuts in support for those of working age and a pronounced reshaping of spending in favour of pensioners by the time the brexit referendum took place in 2016 public opinion had already begun to turn against further cuts to social security a trend that is likely to continue in the years ahead rendering the politics of welfare savings ever more intractable the fiscal pressures on the welfare state will only grow all ageing societies like the uk face significant challenges financing their welfare states particularly because of rising health social care and pension costs this shrinks the space for fiscal generosity and sharpens trade offs between the welfare preferences of different sections of the electorate the uk has already aggressively pursued the orthodox repertoire of strategies for mitigating long term fiscal pressures of ageing on the welfare state migration has grown the employment rate is at a record high punitive working age welfare conditionality has been imposed and the state pension age has been hiked on each score the limits have been reached any version of brexit will serve to intensify these fiscal constraints not only because of the damage done to tax revenues but also because of additional pressures on spending since the referendum there have been repeated calls from across the spectrum for increased spending to respond to the popular demand for change and shore up britain s domestic and international frailties we ve seen this on issues ranging from industrial and regional policy to training housing farming and defence there is little sign that brexit points towards a smaller state all told the brexit penumbra will make the already difficult politics of moving to a sustainable 21st century welfare settlement far harder the postwar welfare expansion was funded on the back of major switches in spending priorities historic broadening of the tax base and a prolonged era of productivity growth any post brexit welfare adjustment will have to put more of the strain onto higher taxes there will however be clear limits to the tax rises that a wage squeezed public will bear ultimately the future of the welfare state and the social contact that depends on it will require a rekindling of productivity growth if our liberal market economy cannot achieve this then political pressure will grow for the state to pursue far more dirigiste strategies these will have to encompass the everyday or foundational economy of private sector and publicly procured low wage service jobs in which millions of british workers are employed not just the leading edge of high valued export sectors that industrial strategy typically embraces politics after brexit the marked age divide in british politics that has emerged in recent decades acted as a midwife to the brexit vote and was consolidated at the 2017 general election age has not ended the importance of social class nor have voters values become somehow detached from any relation to their material circumstances or the wider institutions of the economy but it is certainly true that navigating the demographic schism has become the sine qua non of political management in the uk if the brexit cleavage remains central to british politics in the decades ahead and remain vs leave become entrenched in the long term political identities of large swathes of the electorate this will only serve to magnify existing intergenerational tensions political parties seeking paths to electoral majorities will need strategies including public policies for tax and spend and social cohesion that can plausibly overcome or at least ameliorate these divisions and command cross generational support population change will of course alter the make up of the electorate over the long run but recent experience from the uk eu and us politics shows that demographic destinies can take a long time to arrive in the meantime politics can be contingently and rapidly reshaped as parties re orient their strategies to meet electoral demands made by declining or marginalised social groups the playing out of the shift towards increased ethnic diversity will remain a feature of british society and its politics on the one hand public opinion since the referendum shows a marked weakening of hostility to immigration and more generally britain remains a relatively cohesive society compared to some european counterparts however levels of inward migration are likely to remain high in the future albeit rebalanced away from the eu to the rest of the world because of the probable curtailment of free movement and experience in much of the rest of europe shows that discontent about migrants and refugees can quickly be channelled into support for far right and nativist parties britain s majoritarian electoral system has insulated but not inoculated it from these strains of politics one of the biggest questions of post brexit politics is whether this remains the case just as demography will remain a defining divide in post brexit politics so too will territorial politics one of the paradoxes of recent years is that the post 1998 institutions the good friday agreement and 1998 scotland act have at a deep level shaped our constitution yet surface level political debate if not the substantive nature of the deal finally reached with the eu has often proceeded as if we still inhabited some bygone era of unitary state westminster centric politics this contradiction and its consequences not just in terms of its impact on nationalist sentiment in scotland and northern ireland but also on the future trajectories of pro union parties within each of our nations in particular scottish conservatives and the scottish labour party will be one of brexit s legacies it is also possible though difficult to predict that the politics of englishness and the place of england in the union will remerge as an important vector of politics in the uk once the intense focus on brexit and the institutional form it takes diminishes all of this will reverberate through our party system for decades to come to date much of the focus of political debate has been on whether there might be a formal realignment in our party system either through a new centrist party or the emergence of an insurgent english nationalist alternative to ukip that folds in a swath of conservative leave supporters as well as some traditional labour voters whether or not this party realignment comes to pass is moot the hurdles to it are high in a majoritarian electoral system either way the aftershocks of brexit will continue to cause flux within and between the existing parties not least because devolution and the proportional voting systems of the devolved parliaments and assemblies create space for political insurgency that can profoundly influence the major uk parties political identities have been shaken up if not completely broken by the brexit convulsion it will be years before they settle down and when they finally do it will affect not just who voters trust and the issues they gravitate to but the political coalitions they might join after the brexit storm the leave vote was not simply an exercise in imperial nostalgia as some have claimed but as we have shown there are deep continuities between britain s present and its past that will shape its future the dominant role of the city in the uk economy and the liberal framework of its political economy have endured over decades as has the nature of its welfare state even the newly emergent forces that are restructuring the institutions of the union and the relationships between its nations have deeper historical roots but a political moment as large as brexit will without doubt bring change too some of it directly related to leaving the eu but much of it rooted in other long standing failings whether on regional inequality housing or economic insecurity that now have greater political potency add to this the newer societal challenges that any government has to face up to in the decades ahead switching to low carbon production and transportation systems meeting the escalating care costs arising from ageing and supporting the workforce to transition to longer working lives and then consider the pent up problems caused by the austerity decade that will trouble our public realm in the years ahead councils and school chains going bust hospitals needing bailing out demands for the universal credit roll out to be halted and so on in addition to these burdens on state capacity will be the return of eu responsibilities to the uk amid a period of uncertainty whether it is forging a new trade policy in a protectionist age a competition policy fit for the challenge of big tech or a migration framework suited to a greying society the british state will be learning to read a new map in a fast shifting landscape the confluence of these pre existing pressures with the new and urgent imperatives of brexit will put strains on the state that have not been experienced since at least the mid 1970s it is hard not to see government becoming more involved in key aspects of our national economic life certainly as a result of necessity and possibly ideology too will however this greater involvement give rise to any fundamental shift in our political economy in part the answer will of course come down to political choice no variety of democratic capitalism is immutable for the first time in recent memory the momentum in both main political parties simultaneously lies with those favouring radical economic rupture whether through leaving the eu without a deal if necessary and pivoting towards a low tax deregulated singapore of the west model or restoring public ownership and state financed and directed growth the politics of the moment would suggest the british model is set for profound upheaval yet if there is a lesson from 20th century history it is that some core features of our political economy are hard to shift they have survived multiple changes of government world wars contrasting philosophies of economic management and profound shifts in the structure of the global economy anyone assuming that the political tumult of brexit will inevitably give rise to some fundamental re ordering of our capitalist model whether for good or ill may well be waiting in vain what is certainly true however is that the constellation of pressures facing the uk means that a key feature of the post brexit era will be learning to navigate vulnerability in the macro economy the uk will live with levels of public debt that are far higher than the recent norm for decades to come at the same time as interest rates seem likely to sit close to the floor reduced policy space means more risk of exposure to shocks a sense of heightened economic exposure will also be the norm for the british worker and not just because of their weak bargaining position and the continued decline of unions workers are likely to remain exposed to the risk of further exchange rate devaluation which as recent years have shown feeds through directly into lower real wages the risk that mobile employers decide to uproot production and leave the uk or downgrade their operations here is also likely to be heightened for years to come at the constitutional level too precariousness will prevail no one can know how brexit will play out on the forces pushing for scottish independence though it is not unreasonable to think that the shock of a hard brexit might set back the independence cause in the short to medium term while strengthening it beyond that either way the issue will remain at the fore as will the status of northern ireland and most probably the governance of england within the union far fewer of these issues are settled than seemed the case just a few years ago the governing challenge is not just the technical task of successfully negotiating these risks if there are reasons to hope that the resilience and flexibility of the uk s economy will help it to adjust to life outside the eu albeit with weaker rates of growth and less dynamism than in the past the same may not be true of our politics the political challenge of forging a coalition of electoral support that could undergird any sustainable governing programme in the decade ahead is a profound one as various contributions to this volume show post brexit politics is likely to remain deeply divided along a number of connected fault lines generational geographical and identity cleavages that cut across the support bases of the two main parties crafting a political agenda that spans these divides sufficiently to allow tough governing choices to be made would require remarkable leadership by the standards of any age let alone one in which the main parties are so visibly struggling to rise to the level of events whatever the chain of events in the months and years ahead a soft or hard brexit or remaining in the eu through a second referendum there will be a legacy of rancour and bitterness that will be hard to contain within the existing party system and which may even challenge the basic norms of conduct of democratic politics and even if the uk does leave the eu the european question will endure as a major vector of british politics for as switzerland and others have found any country that is a close neighbour to a large and powerful bloc like the eu is likely to be in permanent negotiation with it all the more so if as seems highly likely the uk remains a regulatory rule taker in one form or another politics more than economics may be the uk s undoing we should however exercise caution about the gloom in the heat of a crisis it is always tempting to foresee an age of continued tumult that case is easily made in brexit britain but there are also countervailing forces too the consequences of breaking trading ties with the eu are so dire that one way or another the uk will seek to navigate its way towards a relatively close relationship with it the strengths that have given the british model momentum will hardly fade overnight even if they now face great strain our high value services world leading university sector and job rich labour market all provide grounds for optimism the british state has shown itself capable of strategic purpose and organisational ingenuity in the last century and however unfashionable it may be to point this out in the current moment there remains a residual resilience in the democratic politics of the uk declinism is often overwrought and overstated in british public life that too is a part of our tradition but history suggests powerful new directions can be forged in public policy even in times of adversity they have many times before and no doubt will again this is an extract from the forthcoming book britain beyond brexit published by wiley it first appeared in the political quarterly nick

zimbabwe s president emmerson mnangagwa has promised action in response to a crackdown by security forces on anti government protesters following a hike in the price of fuel lawyers and activists say police and soldiers have killed at least a dozen people wounded scores and arrested hundreds over the demonstrations zimbabwe s human rights commission accused security forces of systematic torture critics say the country is reverting to the authoritarian rule that characterised the 37 year regime of former leader robert mugabe who was forced from power after a coup in november 2017 the crisis will not be easy to fix there is a severe shortage of dollars fuel and medicines while inflation hit 42 in december the highest in a decade foreign investors are by and large staying away what sparked the latest clashes everyday life has been getting harder as the price of basic goods spirals in the past two months the country has suffered acute shortages of imported goods including medicines food and fuel motorists can wait for hours to fill up at fuel stations where soldiers are often deployed to break up fights over who is next in line on january 12 mnangagwa announced to reporters that the price of petrol had increased to 3 31 a litre from 1 32 but there would be no increase for foreign embassies and tourists paying in cash us dollars it was the final straw for some zimbabweans and violent protests broke out two days after his announcement some residents say that while calm has returned soldiers have continued to beat up civilians many people blame mnangagwa for failing to fulfil his pre election promises to kick start economic growth and make a clean break with the strongarm rule of his predecessor genesis of cash shortages the country abandoned the zimbabwe dollar in 2009 after inflation reached 500 billion percent the year before in its place the government adopted the us dollar and other currencies including sterling and the south african rand people hoped the move would spell the end of spiralling prices and rampant money printing that made much of their earnings and savings virtually worthless but over time supply of the us and south african currencies dried up so in november 2016 authorities in harare launched a surrogate currency paper bond notes designed to ease acute hard currency shortages the notes which now have a total face value of 400 million are backed by a 500 million loan from the african export and import bank the central bank has said they are used like cash officially pegged to the dollar at a rate of 1 1 on the street 1 fetches up to three bond notes reflecting the ongoing shortage of us dollars and people s desire to trade out of cheapening bond notes and into more reliable currency a dwindling supply of bond notes and coins has led to banks limiting daily withdrawals to as little as 30 in bond notes companies are struggling to pay for imports and foreign investors cannot repatriate dividends or profits zollars when the bond note was introduced dollar deposits in the electronic banking system started losing their value government borrowing via treasury bills meant authorities were creating money without the backing of sufficient currency reserves or gold it is these electronic dollars theoretically worth 10 billion and nicknamed zollars by economists that are raising fears that zimbabwe might be heading for its second financial collapse in a decade zimbabweans can do little but watch as the money in their bank accounts loses value compared with cash prompting demands from businesses and civil servants for hard currency which can be deposited and used to make payments zollars remain officially pegged at 1 1 to the u s dollar but on the black market 1 is now worth four zollars that has led some businesses to offer discounts on dollar payments zimbabwe s foreign reserves now provide less than two weeks cover for imports central bank data show the government has said it would only consider launching a new currency if it had at least six months of reserves but finance minister mthuli ncube said zimbabwe planned to introduce a new currency in the next 12 months how are businesses affected companies are struggling to import raw materials and equipment forcing them to buy dollars on the black market civil servants are paid in zollars like many other workers across the country only a small minority of employees working for foreign embassies charities or large international corporations are paid in us dollars last october the central bank ordered banks to create separate us dollar accounts for clients who are paid from overseas which analysts said was a tacit admission by authorities that the greenback was not equal to the zollar the confederation of zimbabwe industries has warned that some of its members could stop operating by the end of the month due to the dollar crunch the group said its members had a backlog of 480 million in unpaid payments to foreign suppliers cooking oil and soap maker olivine industries said on saturday it had suspended production and put workers on indefinite leave because it owed foreign suppliers 11 million zimbabwe s largest brewing company delta beverages part owned by anheuser busch inbev said it had abandoned a plan to only accept hard currency payments rather than zollars for its beer and soft drinks after the government intervened what s next mnangagwa a former spy chief installed after mugabe s removal in a coup in november 2017 was elected in july amid hopes that he would help secure an economic turnaround for zimbabwe and has said his nation is open for business but critics say the man nicknamed the crocodile is moving too slowly on economic and political reforms including repealing mugabe era laws that restrict the media mnangagwa has also called for the lifting of u s sanctions against officials from the zanu pf ruling party top military figures and some government owned firms which were imposed during mugabe s rule for what washington called violations of human rights and democracy the imf has said it would be difficult for the fund to support the country s reform programme unless its 2 billion arrears with the world bank african development bank and european investment bank are paid harare says that should be done in the next 12 months and plans a programme allowing the imf to monitor its economic reforms although it does not entail funding from the lender analysts said the ongoing security crackdown could quell the protests for now but more clashes were expected unless mnangagwa s administration could find a solution to the cash shortages reuters
i shouldn t but i delight in discussing donald trump s presidency with friends on the left not to commiserate over what a pig the man is calling someone a pig is presidential language now so that s fair ball right that s just easy what s fascinating is the reaction when you advance the argument that trump judged solely on his actions is the most left wing president any of us has ever seen by people on the left incidentally i don t mean small l bourgeois reflexive urban liberals i mean committed progressives people who believe in collectivism over rugged individualism in the replacement of social hierarchy with social equality who advocate wealth redistribution and robust government intervention to restrain the predations of the market generally these people also oppose government austerity and militarism and globalization they are generally well educated and serious and they can be irritatingly self righteous which is why it s such fun to point out that trump has often been their objective ally free trade many leftists are deeply suspicious of the very concept trade treaties in the eyes of real progressives again as opposed to garden variety liberals involve government surrendering its sovereign ability to protect industries that need protecting and letting the markets attack workers rights free trade can also make it easier for companies to offshore jobs into low wage countries for that reason most of the opposition to the original canada u s free trade agreement came from the political left and from labour unions they lost jean chrétien s liberals once in power discovered a great affection for trade deals and while u s presidents bill clinton and barack obama evinced sympathy with workers they ultimately refused to restrict trade clinton in fact signed nafta the original deal s big expansion trump s protectionist rhetoric outdoes even that of labour leaders and social democrats writes neil macdonald martin mejia associated press then along came the left s most important ally on the issue in nearly 100 years donald trump not only made it a priority to attack and ultimately get rid of nafta he used tariffs to among other things punish companies for sourcing manufacturing offshore trump s protectionist rhetoric outdoes even that of labour leaders and social democrats he ferociously attacks globalization which he his followers call globalism he declares himself a nationalist he s turning back the clock logically mel hurtig s council of canadians and old school trade warriors like maude barlow and north america s union leadership should be proud of him i doubt they d admit it but they should be fiscal policy true the thinking of leftist politicians has evolved somewhat on the question of government borrowing but progressives attitude is still often deficits be damned people come first spend what is necessary prime that pump again judging by the evidence trump agrees he promised as a candidate to get rid of the national debt but once in office his leftist leanings took hold not only is he tariff man to use the title he invented for himself he s also stimulus man i am a tariff man when people or countries come in to raid the great wealth of our nation i want them to pay for the privilege of doing so it will always be the best way to max out our economic power we are right now taking in billions in tariffs make america rich again realdonaldtrump at the end of 2018 the u s national debt stood at 21 974 trillion more than 2 trillion higher than it was when trump assumed office two years ago in the last fiscal year which ended on sept 30 2018 the national deficit was 779 billion up about 17 per cent from the previous year it s on track to hit a trillion this year according to some analysts conservatives who complain about bequeathing a legacy of debt to future generations are simply ignored by this white house back in the 1990s when socialists ruled ontario ndp finance minister pink floyd laughren presided over unheard of borrowing too but he did it to help an economy in deep recession so did obama but pink donald is doing it during a boom granted trump s stimulus has mostly been tax cuts but that s what congress allowed remember trump also promised 1 5 trillion in infrastructure spending maybe that s coming too who knows monetary policy a few years ago a coalition of left leaning interest groups alarmed over the u s federal reserve s stated intention to raise interest rates as the economy picked up momentum started sending out email blasts in support of a petition titled tell the fed don t raise interest rates it didn t work the fed decided the years of super cheap money and crazed borrowing had to stop and began raising rates the bank of canada followed suit as they most often do politicians here and in the united states accepted the policy change abiding by the convention that the central bank must operate independently except of course for pink donald the only problem our economy has is the fed tweeted the big blond lefty who sees himself as an expert in monetary policy among a great many other things they don t have a feel for the market they don t understand necessary trade wars or strong dollars the fed is like a powerful golfer who can t score because he has no touch he can t putt basically trump was making the same argument as many progressives the fed is endangering the recovery by raising interest rates war like many on the left donald trump thinks the united states should get out of syria and afghanistan too and in general avoid spending blood and treasure trying to force the american way upon or police the world when trump abruptly tweeted in december that he was withdrawing american troops from syria almost all the negative reaction came from conservatives and centrist liberals the left which has consistently argued correctly that the iraq war was a disaster that very little has changed in afghanistan and that american interventions in the middle east have only ever made things worse remained largely silent now it s obvious why there is such reluctance on the left to credit any of trump s policies however much they align with the progressive agenda the man is a serial liar a racist and a vulgar boor but then all presidents lie trump is just promiscuous about it at one point in his presidency obama was nicknamed the deporter in chief susan walsh associated press yes he s persecuting undocumented immigrants but obama was at one point nicknamed the deporter in chief yes he is running an imperial presidency but so did his predecessor and his predecessor s predecessor yes he has talked about bombing enemies into oblivion but hillary clinton enabled george w bush s invasion of iraq and a fair amount of oblivion bombing with her senate vote she is more hawkish than trump period and yes he is dismantling protections for the poor and vulnerable but president bill clinton signed then house speaker newt gingrich s personal responsibility and work opportunity act a bill that leftists considered a direct attack on a generation of low income americans finally yes trump is an appalling human being he uses a powerful pulpit to belittle women and minorities brags about molesting women and tacitly eggs on bigots but policy is policy my old friend tom walkom one of the toronto star s most progressive columnists went ahead and said it a few weeks ago i know it is heresy to write this sometimes donald trump is right this column is part of cbc s opinion section for more information about this section

share venezuela is a looted nation in need of a legitimate government and a marshall plan venezuela is a looted nation in need of a legitimate government and a marshall plan criticising corbyn is fair but trivial compared to the plight of ordinary venezuelans criticising corbyn is fair but trivial compared to the plight of ordinary venezuelans there is very little evidence that chavez did anything to really help the poor president maduro of venezuela is fat this isn t a puerile jibe it s a factual observation that provides an insight into the plight of a proud nation with 30 million people and two centuries of independence behind it venezuela is a country blessed with abundant natural resources yet nine out of ten households say they lack sufficient money to buy food survey evidence compiled by three leading universities suggests that venezuelans between the ages of 20 and 65 lost an average of 24 lbs in weight in 2017 a quarter of the population is eating two meals or less a day meanwhile the enduring image of maduro s misrule is a video of him and his wife being theatrically served slabs of steak by a celebrity chef during a visit to istanbul in september in a nation on a fast track to penury and want the regime manages to support itself through corruption and theft it s not even a conventional autocracy any longer but a kleptocracy of a type more typical of the regimes of vladimir putin in russia slobodan milosevic in serbia or ferdinand marcos in the philippines the venezuelan catastrophe a noun phrase that makes more sense now than crisis is often seen in britain through the prism of domestic politics because the people now in charge of the labour party notably jeremy corbyn long hailed the revolutionary regime in caracas as an instrument of social progress and economic development it s tempting to press them on the undeniable evidence of venezuela s immiseration and mass discontent it s a fair question too but it s trivial compared with the sufferings and repression that venezuela s people are enduring it s the duty of democratic governments in the americas and in the european union to now stand by venezuelans and give support to the only legitimate authority now governing the country the national assembly in an article last month for project syndicate ricardo hausmann a harvard economist and former venezuelan planning minister urged coordination between venezuela s democratic forces and the international community he wrote the logical solution is for the national assembly elected in december 2015 with a two thirds opposition majority to resolve the constitutional impasse by designating a new interim government and a new military high command that can organise the return to democracy and end the crisis yesterday the international community in part did its democratic duty by recognising the opposition leader juan guaidó as venezuela s rightful interim president president trump for all his bluster and ignorance was at least right in tweeting the citizens of venezuela have suffered too long at the hands of the illegitimate maduro regime indeed maduro does not head a legitimate constitutional authority his electoral mandate ran out on january 10 his election to a second term took place last may and it was a charade it was based on force and repression in which the main opposition parties were prevented from standing hence the us canada the eu japan and many latin american states refused to recognise the fraudulent result on the concluding day of maduro s first term the permanent council of the organisation of american states passed a resolution agreeing to not recognise the legitimacy of nicolas maduro s new term as of the 10th of january 2019 it s crucial that democratic nations and parties follow suit not only out of principle and in solidarity with a suffering people but because doing nothing will result in humanitarian disaster in november the united nations refugee and migration agencies announced that the number of refugees and migrants from venezuela worldwide had reached three million venezuela under maduro is a repressive state that is well on the way to being a failed state sparking a flight of refugees throughout the region venezuela s collapse is a humanitarian disaster but not a natural catastrophe this is why economists and political scientists informed ones who know the region rather than ideologues need to be listened to on quelling the crisis and rebuilding a functioning polity so far from being a casualty of us sanctions and periodically weaker oil prices venezuela is a victim of destructive domestic policies enforced by severe repression all of it was predictable from what economists know of the effects of among other things administered prices exchange controls and inflationary public financing the economists rudiger dornbusch and sebastian edwards wrote a paper for the world bank in 1989 that was later expanded into a book titled the macroeconomics of populism in latin america they hypothesised a cycle of populism in four stages first the government adopts expansionary policies that boost output and real wages with price controls for basic goods keeping inflation in check where shortages arise the gaps are filled by imports paid for with international reserves second the expansion of demand and the depletion of foreign exchange reserves creates bottlenecks in production the regime resorts to currency devaluation import controls and capital controls these create a surge in inflation and result in a black market for hard currencies principally the world s leading reserve currency the dollar third shortages become endemic consumers spend so much time queueing that productive activity collapses and the economy contracts the currency becomes worthless and capital flees the country living standards collapse and hyperinflation destroys the value of savings that s where venezuela now stands the regime of hugo chavez and nicolas maduro was able to get away with it for so long because of the boom in world oil prices in the 2000s that was pure accident driven by an expansion of global demand especially from china and tight supply constraints in leading oil producers notably nigeria and war ravaged iraq nor was the regime s vaunted social progress in poverty reduction genuine francisco rodriguez left us academia in 2000 excited by the prospect of serving as chief economist of the venezuelan national assembly and helping in the fight against poverty and inequality he served four years during which he observed that the regime ignored legal provisions to allocate oil revenues to anti poverty programmes and indeed directed resources away from the poor writing in foreign policy in 2008 he noted that there is remarkably little data supporting the claim that the chavez administration has acted any differently from previous venezuelan governments or for that matter from those of other developing and latin american nations in redistributing the gains from economic growth to the poor the anti poverty programmes were a mirage incensed by the very notion of independent analysis the regime closed rodriguez s office in 2004 it suspended national accounts data altogether in 2015 though the central bank is belatedly now trying to construct indicators for the imf to avoid sanctions and possible expulsion the imf estimates that venezuela s economy contracted by 18 per cent last year the third straight year of double digit declines and what about the fourth stage in the cycle of populism that s the one still to come the mismanagement hyperinflation and poverty that characterise the regime will give way to crushing austerity and severe constraints on real wages this too makes it urgent that the international community come to venezuela s aid not to bail out a corrupt and brutal regime but to provide a marshall plan for a looted nation this will be far more cost effective as well as more humane than allowing the country to implode but its first requirement is to support the constitutional forces of venezuela longer term there is an important lesson that applies well beyond latin america combating poverty and reducing inequality are vital goals of economic and welfare policy but not all goals and values are compatible with each other they require trade offs the constitutional left understands the limits as well as the vital role of the state in economic intervention and redistribution the populist left which recognises no constraints on its authority forgoes that potential for incremental social improvement and instead creates a wasteland oliver kamm writes for the times
update since this interveiw was published by democracy now president trump has recognized venezuelan opposition leader juan guaidó as interim president calling democratically elected president maduro illegitimate in response venezuela has cut diplomatic ties with the u s giving diplomats 72 hours to leave the country the united states and allied nations in latin america are ratcheting up pressure on venezuela in what appears to be a coordinated effort to remove venezuelan president nicolás maduro from office maduro was sworn in last week to a second 6 year term following his victory in last may s election which was boycotted by the opposition days before maduro was sworn in opposition figure juan guaidó became head of the national assembly which soon voted to declare maduro a usurper in an effort to remove him from office the united states brazil and other nations have welcomed the effort as the political crisis intensifies maduro has reached out to the united nations to help establish a peace dialogue in venezuela in the clip below democracy now speaks with jorge arreaza venezuelan foreign minister he met with u n secretary general antónio guterres this week the transcript follow transcript this is a rush transcript copy may not be in its final form amy goodman this is democracy now i m amy goodman the united states and allied nations in latin america are

his victory in last may s election which was boycotted by the opposition days before maduro was sworn in opposition figure juan guaidó became head of the national assembly which soon voted to declare

decision by juan guaidó to declare the country s presidency vacant on the day of maruro s inauguration january 10th u s secretary of state mike pompeo called guaidó to congratulate him on his election victory to head the national assembly then national security adviser john bolton announced quote the united states does not recognize venezuelan dictator nicolás maduro s illegitimate claim to power unquote brazil now led by the far right president jair bolsonaro has gone a step further by saying it recognizes juan guaidó as the rightful president of venezuela even though guaidó himself hasn t even claimed that title a group of latin american countries known as the lima group also recently voted to not recognize the legitimacy of maduro s presidency mexico was the sole dissenter the u s led effort targeting the oil rich nation of venezuela dates back two decades since the late hugo chávez became president in 1999 in november john bolton accused venezuela cuba and nicaragua of being part of a troika of tyranny in september the new york times reported the trump administration conducted secret meetings with rebellious military officers in venezuela to discuss overthrowing maduro in august maduro survived an assassination attempt when he was attacked by a small drone he accused the u s and colombia of being involved in the plot in 2017 president donald trump said he could not rule out a quote military option to deal with venezuela all of this comes as venezuela is facing a staggering economic crisis caused in part by falling oil prices and broad u s sanctions according to the imf inflation is over 1 million percent in the last year the highest rate in the world there are widespread reports of food and medicine shortages the united nations estimates 3 million venezuelans have left venezuela since 2015 resulting in what the u n has described as an unprecedented migration crisis in latin america as the political turmoil intensifies venezuelan president nicolás maduro has reached out to the united nations to help establish a peace dialogue in venezuela venezuela s foreign minister jorge arreaza met this week with u n secretary general antónio guterres here in new york on thursday i had a chance to interview foreign minister arreaza who has served as foreign minister for the past three years from 2013 to 16 he served as venezuela s vice president i began by asking him if he believes venezuela is being set up for a coup jorge arreaza of course it s evident and you see this man who nobody knows in venezuela you ask in the streets who is juan guaidó and nobody knows him but he s being pushed to say that he is the new president by the u s he hasn t said that but pompeo says it almagro from the oas says it and other presidents say that now he s the president they are trying to push a political conflict in venezuela they are calling the armed forces to make pronunciations against president maduro that s what they want a coup d état in venezuela they want a war in venezuela and it s not going to happen amy goodman so let s talk more about what you believe is the role of the united states in coalescing opposition to maduro jorge arreaza they are the bosses of the opposition they tell them what to do nothing that the opposition does is without the permission or authorization of the state department at least here in the united states and they confess this they say we have to make consultations with the embassy we have to make consultations with the department of state it happens i mean they are not free they are not independent but in spite of all of that the president is trying to sit again with the opposition with the democratic opposition not the extremist opposition that makes violent demonstrations and burns people alive no and that is what he s going to insist on the dialogue but this what is happening now john bolton tweeting and doing communiqués and pompeo and everyone saying that maduro is not the president that he s illegitimate that he s a usurper come on that is a coup d état again against venezuela amy goodman well explain that term a usurper i mean it looks like you know a case is being built for an overthrow when he when guaidó the opposition the head of the national assembly announces that maduro is a usurper jorge arreaza i mean they are manipulating the venezuela constitution they say that the elections where almost 10 million venezuelans voted and more than 6 million voted for maduro that this didn t happen no amy goodman the opposition boycotted jorge arreaza yes they boycotted it not only the opposition washington and bogotá and lima and santiago these governments no neoliberal governments in latin america so they said when the elections were conveyed three months before the elections they said they re going to be a fraud and they wouldn t recognize the results and then they pressed the potential candidates of the opposition not to register and when some of them registered they pressed them to retire to withdraw and they didn t and now they say that because the elections were a fraud then there s no president of venezuela so the president of the national assembly has to be the new president and all these governments and the u s government are encouraging this thesis so it s very dangerous amy goodman i want to continue on what the u s is doing in november national security adviser john bolton claimed venezuela was part of a troika of tyranny john bolton the troika of tyranny in this hemisphere cuba venezuela and nicaragua has finally met its match in venezuela the united states is acting against the dictator maduro who uses the same oppressive tactics that have been employed in cuba for decades he has installed an illegitimate constituent assembly debased the currency for political gain and forced his people to sign up for a corrupt food distribution service or face certain starvation amy goodman in december venezuelan president nicolás maduro accused u s national security adviser john bolton of leading a plan to invade venezuela president nicolás maduro today i come out once again to denounce the plot set forth by the u s to destroy venezuela s democracy to assassinate me and to impose a dictatorship in venezuela mr john bolton has been assigned once again as the chief of a plot to fill venezuela with violence and to seek a foreign military intervention a coup assassinate president maduro and impose what they call a transitory government amy goodman foreign minister can you elaborate on this and also this term troika of tyranny very much reminiscent of george w bush s axis of evil jorge arreaza yes the axis of evil no and it s reminiscent of the language used in the cold war nixon mccarthy all that dark history no and it has no sense we re in the 21st century you have to respect the sovereign nations we have the right to build our own model democratic model and yes the united states government especially the obsession of bolton of john bolton against president maduro they are behind everything that is happening in venezuela yes they almost killed assassinated president maduro august the 4th with drones and it amy goodman well let s talk about this this was the first drone attack attempted assassination on a head of state in history jorge arreaza yes amy goodman august 4th it was a saturday it was in front of the palace of justice jorge arreaza yes amy goodman maduro was giving a speech and explain exactly what happened jorge arreaza what happened is that suddenly a drone appeared and it exploded amy goodman were you there jorge arreaza i wasn t there but most of the ministers were there and the military forces were there and the other branches of power were there and it was two drones these people were trained in colombia we told we gave this information to the colombian government we gave them the place where they were trained the people who were involved the names of the people of the officials of migration that led them across to venezuela with the drones we gave the u s government the information about these people in miami who met there and also were part of this plot against president maduro and nothing happened amy goodman well before it in april at the latin american summit in lima peru vice president mike pence said more must be done to isolate venezuelan president nicolás maduro vice president mike pence we must all stand with our brothers and sisters suffering in venezuela and i can promise you the united states will not rest we will not relent until democracy is restored in venezuela and the venezuelan people reclaim their birthright of libertad amy goodman so that s vice president mike pence in june venezuelan president nicolás maduro called u s vice president mike pence a viper and vowed to defeat what he called washington s attempts to force him from power president nicolás maduro every time the poisonous viper of mike pence opens his mouth i feel stronger clearer of what the road is the road is ours it is venezuelan it is not the one mike pence points out to us not 20 poisonous snakes not 20 vipers like mike pence amy goodman foreign minister arreaza explain why what is mike pence s particular interest here you re looking at pence bolton jorge arreaza bolton amy goodman and pompeo now secretary of state jorge arreaza pompeo as well you know pence you know he s a religious guy he s from the extreme right you know him and he s obsessed as well with the venezuelan revolution you see they say that you have to restore democracy in venezuela we have a democracy we have had 25 elections in 20 years we ve had elections for president in 1998 in 2000 2004 2006 in 2009 2012 2013 2018 i mean our people are used to and not only democracy because the constitution says you have to elect these presidents and parliament members and mayors and governors no because we have our society is organized in community councils consejos comunales and communes and you take the decisions every single day venezuelans are exercising democracy we have democratized the access to education which was being privatized before the revolution we have democratized access to housing which was also exclusive for the rich before the revolution we have democratized access to health we have doctors all over they used to be cubans now they re venezuelans all over the country you walk one block and you have the doctor there so we are really trying to build a root democracy rooted in the people and that is what they don t like because that is not what they would like from the countries of latin america amy goodman i want to talk about sanctions and the effect they re having on the venezuelan economy you have henry kissinger still an elder statesmen consulted by democrats and republicans alike let s go back half a century go back decades he wanted to make the chilean economy under allende scream he said jorge arreaza yes amy goodman you have the half century embargo against cuba what does economic pressure economic sabotage if you will look like in venezuela in november the congressional research service published a short overview of current u s sanctions in venezuela and mentions the trump administration is considering a new wave of sanctions but the report also states quote although stronger economic sanctions could influence the venezuelan government s behavior they also could have negative effects and unintended consequences analysts are concerned that stronger sanctions could exacerbate venezuela s difficult humanitarian situation which has been marked by shortages of food and medicines increased poverty and mass migration many venezuelan civil society groups oppose sanctions that could worsen humanitarian conditions now again this is not the venezuelan president saying this this is the u s congressional research service can you talk about the effect of u s sanctions on venezuela jorge arreaza the venezuelan people are suffering because of these so called sanctions which are cohesive unilateral measures this is not approved by the united nations security council it has no legality these are decisions taken by one government unilaterally to impose a blockade against venezuela so it s difficult for us to import food to import medicine we cannot use the dollar as a currency to exchange we have to switch only this switching from dollars to euros is more than what we need to invest in in importing the vaccines for our children or the treatment for hiv in venezuela for two years and it s probably the figure that i can give you is more than 20 000 million that we have lost because of the so called sanctions in more than a year amy goodman so these sanctions are overt are there covert sanctions against venezuela jorge arreaza of course because it s not only this that is official it s pressing the companies not to work with venezuela it s threatening to seize a company that we have here in the united states citgo we cannot repatriate the profit from our company in the united states to invest it in food and medicine in venezuela amy goodman and for people to know citgo which is venezuelan state oil company jorge arreaza owned yes amy goodman has been used for many years in the united states to support poor people jorge arreaza yes yes amy goodman in their programs for to have oil in the winter jorge arreaza yes and we intend to keep on using it for this in the united states but most of the profit annually should be sent to venezuela and we cannot do it it has to be here in the banks of the united states blocked we have more than 1 600 million or euros blocked in europe in this company intermediary it s called euroclear why because of the sanctions amy goodman you mentioned russia on wednesday russian foreign minister sergey lavrov expressed concerns over u s meddling in venezuela jorge arreaza yes sergey lavrov we have heard talk that allows for military involvement in venezuela talk that the united states will now recognize as the president of venezuela not nicolás maduro but the representative of the parliament all this is very alarming and all this shows is that the approach of undermining governments the united states doesn t like stays on as a priority of their activity in latin america and in other regions amy goodman if you can talk about the significance of lavrov weighing in also the latest news in december russia landing two nuclear capable blackjack bombers in venezuela as part of a joint training exercise jorge arreaza you know russia has been friends of venezuela for over 16 years we believe that the world has to have several poles several centers not only the united states the united states cut all the military cooperation with venezuela 20 years ago and we have military cooperation with russia and these planes aircrafts that came this year they came in 2013 as well and nothing happened but this year it was taken like it was that we were trying to bomb the u s and come on that s nonsense we have the right to have cooperation with russia with china with whatever country in the world and what lavrov said there is exactly what the united states is doing and he knows that they are trying to manipulate the people the media the constitution of venezuela even to impose a man who has not been elected president amy goodman venezuelan foreign minister jorge arreaza we ll be back with him in 30 seconds amy goodman this is democracy now democracynow org the war and peace report i m amy goodman as we continue with my interview with the venezuelan foreign minister jorge arreaza amy goodman you have massive flight from venezuela the u n high commissioner for refugees has called the ongoing venezuelan migration crisis unprecedented in latin america the u n estimates about 3 million venezuelans have left since 2015 another 2 million are projected to leave this year about a million of them are living in colombia half a million in peru ecuador argentina chile panama brazil all have large numbers why foreign minister arreaza are so many people so many venezuelans leaving jorge arreaza well first it s not you know how many colombians live in venezuela six million colombians live in venezuela over peruvians and ecuadoreans over 1 million spaniards italians portuguese arabs over 2 million so of course there is migration at the moment because we are blocked because it s difficult to find medicine to find some products of food and the hyperinflation process with an exchange rate amy that is not set by the national authorities in venezuela by the central bank it s set by webpages in miami you know the exchange rate the day before maduro s inauguration was 1 1 000 bolívares which is crazy well the day of the inauguration it duplicated it was 2 000 bolívares for 1 and that has no economic logic that is all political that is warfare that is using the currency against our own people so we are worried of course because there are it s not 3 million venezuelans it s probably 1 million venezuelans and most of the people that have gone to colombia are colombians that live in venezuela and that have gone back to their country and we are willing them to come back to venezuela that s what we want for the venezuelans and the colombians that lived in venezuela to come back to venezuela amy goodman but the economy inflation over a million percent last year jorge arreaza yeah but that amy goodman the highest rate in the world jorge arreaza that s the figure of the imf that s not the exact that s not the figure at all it s probably 10 times less than that it s a very difficult problem but this inflation is induced from abroad it is produced by these webpages and all this warfare economic warfare against venezuela it is not only because we have not taken some measures in venezuela of course it s not and it makes things very difficult for the venezuelan people amy goodman so food and medicine shortages do you feel that your government the maduro government takes some responsibility for what s taking place jorge arreaza of course we are not perfect as the government here is not perfect at all and the government in argentina is not perfect of course we have responsibilities but most of the problem the vast majority of the problems in venezuela are caused by the blockade are caused by the warfare economic warfare against venezuela and in spite of all of that we are in a better situation today than we were in 2016 there is more food there is more medicine there s more the employment is under 6 unemployment is under 6 percent and many things i mean we have not closed one school one university one hospital we have not expelled the cuban doctors because we have to protect our people we have delivered more than 2 000 500 houses to our people in the last four years and that is investment that we have made in spite of the sanctions in spite of the blockade against venezuela amy goodman so let me ask you about human rights watch and the venezuelan ngo foro penal recently releasing a report accusing venezuelan intelligence and security forces of detaining and torturing military personnel accused of plotting against the government the report claims quote some detainees were subjected to egregious abuses that amount to torture to force them to provide information about alleged conspiracies jorge arreaza that s psychological warfare against venezuela of course there are detainees that were in plots last year to overthrow president maduro but no one is torturing them this happened in the last century in venezuela we were used to torture we were used to students being killed in the streets every week we were used to repression that stopped with the bolivarian revolution it doesn t happen anymore but these ngos are paid also by the usaid and by the government of the united states and they say what they have to say because they are paid amy goodman so i want to ask you about other leaders in latin america on the one hand you have brazil s far right president now jair bolsonaro and argentina s president mauricio macri meeting to discuss joint opposition to the venezuelan government and then you have the newly elected president of mexico amlo andrés manuel lópez obrador who is not joining with these other countries who are opposing venezuela but first talk about the macri bolsonaro alliance and what that means joining with the u s jorge arreaza yes as i told you it s in latin america it s like a company you know a corporation trump is the ceo of a corporation and these presidents who are businessmen are his directors and they want to be promoted by president trump so they have to do they have to follow the orders and they have been said that they have to isolate maduro that they have to not recognize maduro s government and they have to do what the united states says so in order to overthrow maduro and that s what they re doing of course we are worried about brazil because this man is far on the right it s fascism again it s what we felt that what we believed to have disappeared from the latin american history it s happening again this man hates women this man hates the black population this man hates the homosexual community this man hates venezuelans he s a racist we are worried about brazil he hates the poor but amy goodman and loves the brazilian former brazilian military dictatorship jorge arreaza yes he loves the dictatorship amy goodman and what does it mean to you that amlo the president of mexico andrés manuel lópez obrador the stance he has taken in support of venezuela jorge arreaza i believe that the president of mexico is right we have to respect each other we have to respect the principles of international law i mean if you join the united nations it s because you respect the internal affairs of the other states it s because you respect the equality of states it s because you don t have the right to interfere in other nations that s not what the united states does they have done wars in iraq president trump said that he regretted we regretted that the united states invaded iraq because now the situation is worse than it was with saddam hussein and the same in libya amy goodman and yet you see the same thing happening and of course a very serious similarity you have george w bush coining the term or his people writing the term and him saying it in 2002 axis of evil which set up the foundation for the invasion of iraq and then you have the u s talking about the troika of tyranny jorge arreaza yes amy goodman and the similarities between iraq and venezuela are three letters oil and interestingly many years ago the original name of the invasion of iraq was going to be operation iraqi liberation but they realized the acronym was oil and they had to change it that was the united states but what about this similarity this resource focusing on countries that are you know the world s most important oil providers jorge arreaza i am sure that if in venezuela we only had bananas none of this intervention would be happening but we have oil we have gas we have gold we have silver we have bauxite we have iron we have water i mean venezuela is a very rich wealthy nation and that is why we are they want to rule the country again as they did until 1998 they want to have control of the venezuelan resources and that is why they are so obsessed to overthrow maduro because they want to have these resources for the development of capitalism here in the united states amy goodman what do you think this coup will look like if it takes place jorge arreaza well first of all it cannot take place because we have to defend our constitution and we have to defend the peace of the venezuelan people and the military forces in venezuela are aligned with the constitution they support the constitution and as a consequence of that they support the legitimate president who is nicolás maduro no doubt about it so it won t happen but what they would like to happen is that some militaries say that maduro is not the president anymore and then that they will appoint this young fellow guaidó as president with no constitutional support and then they will have control of pdvsa of the oil of venezuela you said it the oil they will have control of the companies of venezuela of the resources the gold and everything and they believe that is possible that s not possible not in venezuela maybe in some other country but not in venezuela amy goodman i m looking at a tweet that just came over from florida senator marco rubio he says we must support those members of military in venezuela who have announced they will defend the constitution and recognize guaidó as legitimate interim president that s the president of the national assembly jorge arreaza yes you know that those are supposed to be military people they live in peru they don t live in venezuela that s part amy goodman you re talking about the picture he tweeted out jorge arreaza yes that s a video amy goodman of military men jorge arreaza that s a video that last night came and it s supposed to be venezuelan militaries who live in peru i mean that s part of the show they are probably paid maybe by the peruvian government i don t know they are in the peruvian tv but that s not happening in venezuela that s what marco rubio wants that this were to happen in venezuela that the military were to announce that they don t recognize president maduro that s not going to happen and if it were to happen a small group we are ready for any scenario but that s they want a coup d état in venezuela that s a good proof of what bolton pence and trump and marco rubio want for venezuela amy goodman well let me ask you about the issue of press freedom in venezuela jorge arreaza yes amy goodman in december the 75 year old newspaper el nacionalpublished its last issue it was the largest remaining opposition newspaper publishing in venezuela the committee to protect journalists reported the closure was due to restrictions that the government imposed on access to newsprint according to cpj over 20 venezuelan publications have been forced out of print due to government restrictions on newsprint natalie southwick of cpj said quote the disappearance of el nacional s print edition is the latest casualty of the venezuelan government s ever expanding campaign to silence critical reporting and limit the voices of independent media in the country jorge arreaza you know before all this economical trouble and problems we have we used to subsidize the import of paper for the newspapers and now it s the private newspapers that have to import their own newspaper and it s more expensive so that s what happened to el nacional but el nacional you can check the social networks you can check twitter you can put in google you can google kill maduro matar a maduro maldito maduro and it s all over all the media in venezuela the radio stations newspapers tv broadcasting channels of the opposition probably 70 percent of the media in venezuela which is private is against the government and encouraging all these situations to happen because they are owned by the wealthy families traditional wealthy families of venezuela but i mean that s part of the show saying that in venezuela there is no free press and freedom of speech amy goodman but what about the shutting down of this almost two dozen papers jorge arreaza that s not true amy goodman el nacional is not jorge arreaza they re bankrupt they don t have enough money they don t sell enough newspaper in order to have money to import their own paper amy goodman for a non venezuelan audience how would you define the bolivarian revolution i mean you are the foreign minister under maduro you re also the son in law of hugo chávez talk about that history jorge arreaza the history of the bolivarian revolution is a process of independence of giving back the people their rights of guaranteeing that the people have access to health to education to housing to culture to their national identity to their sovereignty that is the venezuelan revolution democratizing our society really democratizing the human rights in venezuela that is what we re trying to do using the wealth of the oil and the other natural resources to invest it in the people for the people as abraham lincoln said that s our mean that s our goal that s what happened but because those resources are not for the u s are not for other interests in the world they are trying to overthrow president chávez and then president maduro and they will continue president maduro would like to have a conversation with president trump and it would probably solve some issues because i am sure that when they if they were to talk and see each other to the eyes they would see that they can coexist and they can fulfill some agreements between them but there s no way i haven t been able to have a meeting with not with pompeo who is like a minister of foreign affairs no with no one in the state department they don t want to have dialogue with the venezuelan authorities what s that that s uncivilized amy goodman final question and this is about the international criminal court in september argentina canada chile colombia paraguay peru called on the icc to investigate venezuela human rights watch hailed the move saying in two crackdowns in 2014 and 2017 venezuelan security forces committed systematic abuses against critics including torture human rights watch research shows they detained more than 5 400 people between april and july 2017 members of the security forces have beaten detainees severely and tortured them with electric shocks asphyxiation sexual assault and other brutal techniques jorge arreaza that s part also of the show now you can compare the human rights record of venezuela with argentina or brazil or any of these countries that are doing manipulating the international institutions and using them to attack venezuela we are waiting for michelle bachelet who is the high commissioner of human rights of the united nations to visit venezuela she s amy goodman michelle bachelet the former president of chile jorge arreaza yes she is amy goodman a torture survivor herself jorge arreaza yes she is and she s been invited by president maduro and we re waiting for her to come to venezuela and to see the situation by herself of course this is part of the warfare against venezuela but as i told you this is going to be part of the past amy these governments right wing governments in latin america are going to be over some of them this year some of them next year and venezuela is going to be there at least the revolution amy goodman how do explain this right wing wave throughout latin america of course excluding mexico jorge arreaza yes mexico bolivia nicaragua the caribbean nations they have popular governments as well but it s uruguay of course has a progressive government as well but it s part of the cycle you know it s part of the cycles but i must say that the united states was focused on the middle east after 9 11 and they invested all these funds and money and suddenly the progressive governments became majority in latin america and when they turned their head they said hey what s happening here we have to do something we have to do a coup d état in honduras because this zelaya is trying to do a progressive government we have to fund the candidates of the right we have to so they have had success until now but the peoples of latin america are seeing are witnessing this and they will change the conditions they will change because the peoples have the right to be in power in latin america amy goodman jorge arreaza venezuelan foreign minister he was here in new york to meet with the u n secretary general he s also the former vice president of venezuela and the son in law of the late president hugo chávez

mark in welcoming you to our fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call starting on page two of our quarterly earnings review presentation this morning we reported fourth quarter net income of 409 9 million earnings per share were 1 80 and our return on common equity was 17 as noted on the second page of our earnings release this quarter s results included 5 7 million of severance related and restructuring charges within expenses and 30 million in benefits for income taxes primarily attributable to the adjustments recorded associated with the tax cuts and job act before going through our results in detail i would like to comment on some macro factors impacting our business during the quarter equity markets had a mixed impact on us during the quarter end of period markets were unfavorable on a year over year basis with the s p 500 and msci eafe indices declining 6 2 and 13 4 respectively on a sequential basis both indices also declined with the s p 500 down 14 and the eafe down 12 5 also on a sequential basis the average daily market value of the s p 500 was down 5 1 while the eafe declined 6 3 however as you will recall some of our fees are based on lagged pricing and in the prior quarter the s p 500 was up 7 2 while the eafe was up 1 8 short term interest rates continued to increase during the quarter driven by a rate hike from the federal reserve currency rates influenced the translation of non us currencies to the us dollar and therefore impact client assets and certain revenues and expenses the british pound and euro versus the us dollar ended the quarter down 6 and 5 respectively compared to the prior year the british pound and euro also declined sequentially the year over year and sequential declines for the pound and euro against the us dollar had an unfavorable impact to revenue and a favorable impact to expense let s move to page three and review the financial highlights of the fourth quarter year over year revenue increased 5 with non interest income up 4 and net interest income up 9 expenses increased 2 from last year the provision for credit losses was a credit of 4 million compared to a credit of 13 million one year ago net income was 15 higher year over year in the sequential comparison revenue increased 2 with non interest income up 2 and net interest income up 3 expenses increased 2 compared to the prior quarter net income increased 9 sequentially return on average common equity was at 17 for the quarter up from 15 1 in both the prior and prior year quarter assets under custody and administration of 10 1 trillion declined 6 compared to one year ago and were down 7 on a sequential basis assets under custody of 7 6 trillion also declined 6 compared to one year ago and were down 7 on a sequential basis both the year over year and sequential declines were primarily driven by lower equity markets and the impact of unfavorable moves in currency exchange rates as well as the impact of one large domestic custody client transitioning out during the quarter assets under management were 1 1 trillion down 8 year over year and down 9 on a sequential basis both the year over year and sequential declines were driven by unfavorable equity markets outflows which include the impact of lower period and security of lending collateral and the impact of unfavorable moves in currency exchange rates let s look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on page four fourth quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was 1 5 billion up 5 from last year and up 2 sequentially trust investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were 934 million in the fourth quarter up 3 year over year and down 1 from the prior quarter foreign exchange trading income was 78 million in the fourth quarter up 24 year over year and up 9 sequentially the year over year increase was primarily due to increased foreign exchange swap activity in our treasury function as well as increased client volumes and higher volatility the sequential increase was primarily driven by higher volatility other non interest income was 75 million in the fourth quarter up 4 compared to one year ago and up 36 sequentially the year over year increase was primarily due to a net gain on the sale of non strategic leases in the current quarter partially offset by lower treasury management fees and securities commission and trading income the sequential increase was also due to the net gain from the lease sale combined with an impairment recorded in the prior quarter as well as a lower visa related swap expense net interest income which i will discuss in more detail later was 430 million in the fourth quarter increasing 9 year over year and up 3 sequentially let s look at the components of our trust and investment fees on page five for our corporate institutional services business fees totaled 536 million in the fourth quarter flat year over year and down 1 on a sequential basis the translation impact of changes in currency rates reduced year over year c is fee growth by approximately 1 5 and the sequential growth by just under 1 custody and fund administration fees the largest component of c is fees were 376 million up 2 compared to the prior year and flat on a sequential basis both the year over year and sequential performances were driven by new business partially offset by the unfavorable impacts of currency exchange rates and markets assets under custody and administration for c is clients were 9 5 trillion at quarter end down 6 year over year and down 7 sequentially both the year over year and sequential declines were primarily driven by lower equity markets and the impact of unfavorable moves in the currency exchange rates as well as the impact of one large domestic custody client transitioning out during the quarter recall that lagged market factors value into the quarter s fees with both quarter lag and month lag markets impacting our c is custody and fund administration fees investment management fees and c is of 105 million for the fourth quarter were down 1 year over year and down 3 sequentially the year over year decline was primarily due to net outflows partially offset by favorable markets and a change to gross revenue presentation the sequential decline was primarily due to outflows assets under management for c is clients were 791 billion down 9 year over year and down 10 sequentially both the year over year and sequential declines were driven by unfavorable equity markets outflows and unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates securities lending fees were 22 million in the fourth quarter down 14 year over year and down 10 sequentially both the year over year and sequential performances were impacted by lower volumes as well as lower spreads securities lending collateral was 150 billion at quarter end and averaged 158 billion across the quarter average collateral levels declined 9 year over year and 7 sequentially moving to our wealth management business trust investment and other servicing fees were 398 million in the fourth quarter up 6 year over year and flat sequentially within wealth management the global family office business fees increased 7 year over year and were up 2 sequentially the year over year growth was driven by new business and favorable markets the sequential performance reflects favorable markets and new business recall that our global family office fees are impacted by quarter lagged market values within the regions the year over year growth was driven by higher fees resulting from the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard new business and favorable markets sequential performance within the regions was relatively flat as the unfavorable impact of lower equity markets was offset by new business assets under management for wealth management clients were 279 billion at quarter end down 4 year over year and down 6 sequentially moving to page six net interest income was 430 million in the fourth quarter up 9 year over year earning assets averaged 112 billion in the fourth quarter down 1 from the prior year total deposits averaged 93 billion and were down 4 year over year interest bearing deposits declined 2 from one year ago to 74 billion non interest bearing deposits which averaged 19 billion during the fourth quarter were down 10 from one year ago loan balances averaged 32 billion in the fourth quarter and were down 5 compared to one year ago the net interest margin was 1 52 in the fourth quarter and was up 13 basis points from a year ago the improvement in the net interest margin compared to the prior year primarily reflects the impact of higher short term interest rates partially offset by higher premium amortization and a balance sheet mix shift on a sequential quarter basis net interest income was up 12 million or 3 average earning assets declined only slightly on a sequential basis as deposit levels were only slightly lower than the prior quarter on a sequential basis the net interest margin increased 5 basis points due to the favorable impact of higher short term rates and a favorable balance sheet mix as we have discussed in our most recent quarters we did continue to see the opportunity for foreign exchange swap activity within our treasury function this activity has the impact of reducing our interest income relating to central bank deposits as we swap out of us dollars but increase our level of foreign exchange trading income for this quarter we saw additional foreign exchange trading income of 17 million offset by 14 million less in net interest income looking at the currency mix of our balance sheet for the fourth quarter us dollar deposits represented 70 of our total deposits this was equal to one year ago and up from 69 in the prior quarter turning to page seven expenses were 1 billion in the fourth quarter and were 2 higher than both the prior and prior year quarter as previously mentioned the current quarter included 5 7 million in expense associated with severance and other charges for comparison purposes note that one year ago our results included severance and other charges of 17 6 million as well as 12 9 million expenses related to a special one time cash bonuses paid in connection with the tax cuts and jobs act the prior quarter included 2 7 million in severance and other related charges excluding the called out charges expense for the quarter was up 5 from one year ago with respect to the remaining increases in year over year expense growth the following items were key drivers within the categories compensation was higher primarily driven by increased incentive compensation and this year s base pay adjustments which were effective in april the impact of staff growth on salaries was more than offset by staff actions and our ongoing location strategy efforts employee benefits were higher primarily due to an increase in retirement plan expenses and higher payroll tax withholding partially offset by lower medical expenses compared to the prior year outside service costs were higher driven primarily by higher third party advisor fees and increased technical service costs expenses partially offset by lower consulting expense there was a corresponding increase to trust investment and other servicing fees as a result of the higher third party advisor fees due to the change to gross revenue presentation equipment and software expense was up year over year due to a software related charge higher software amortization and higher equipment related costs occupancy related costs were lower compared to the prior year primarily relating to non recurring lease adjustments recorded in the prior year other operating expenses were down from the prior year primarily due to lower fdic expense and staff related costs partially offset by higher cost associated with account servicing activities shifting to the sequential expense view excluding the expense charges in both the current and prior quarter expenses were up 2 for the prior quarter compensation expense increased sequentially due to higher cost associated with performance based incentives salaries and other compensation costs employee benefits expense increased primarily due to medical costs outside services increased sequentially due to higher legal and consulting costs and higher technical services expense partially offset by lower sub custody and third party advisor fees the sequential increase in equipment and software was primarily attributable to a software related charge other operating expense declined 8 million from the prior period driven by lower business promotional spending due to the timing of the northern trust sponsored golf tournament during the prior quarter and lower fdic costs partially offset by various other miscellaneous expense categories including cost associated with account servicing activities staff levels increased approximately 4 year over year and 1 sequentially the staff growth was all attributable to staff increases in lower cost locations which include india manila limerick ireland and tempe arizona partially offset by reductions within our higher cost locations turning to page eight as we have discussed on previous calls through our value for spend initiative we are realigning our expense base with the goal of realizing 250 million in expense run rate savings by 2020 concurrently we are embedding a sustainable expense management approach we expect these efforts to slow our expense growth to be more closely aligned with our organic fee growth our fourth quarter results reflect approximately 36 million in expense savings reducing the year over year expense growth by approximately three points this would equate to approximately 145 million on an annualized basis against the 250 million goal we continue to cultivate a healthy pipeline of opportunities turning to the full year our results in 2018 are summarized on page nine net income was 1 6 billion up 30 compared with 2017 and earnings per share were 6 64 up 35 compared with the prior year on the right margin of this page we outlined the non recurring impacts that we called out for both years we achieved a return on equity for the year of 16 2 compared to 12 6 in 2017 full year revenue and expense trends are outlined on page 10 trust investment and other servicing fees grew 9 in 2018 the growth during the year was primarily driven by new business favorable markets the acquisition of ubs fund administration businesses in luxembourg and switzerland and the impact of revenue recognition foreign exchange trading income increased 46 driven by an increase in swap activity within our treasury team and also growth from the client driven trading net interest income increased 13 the growth in net interest income was primarily driven by higher short term interest rates coupled with earning asset growth the net result was 11 growth in overall revenue on a reported basis in 2018 on a reported basis expenses were up 7 from the prior year adjusting for the expense charges in both 16 and 17 that are on the prior page expenses were up 8 from 2017 reflecting the ubs acquisition the underlying growth within our business and the impact of revenue recognition turning to page 11 our key focus has been on sustainably enhancing profitability and returns this slide reflects the progress we have made in recent years to improve the expense to fee ratio pre tax margin and ultimately our return on equity the ratio of expenses to fees is a particularly important measure of our progress as it addresses what we can most directly control reducing this measure from where it was previously as high as 131 in 2011 to the levels we see today is a key contributor to the improvement in our pre tax margin and ultimately our return on equity turning to page 12 our capital ratios remained strong with our common equity tier 1 ratio of 13 7 under the advanced approach and 12 9 under the standardized approach the supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation was 7 and at the bank was 6 4 both of which exceeded the 3 requirement became applicable to northern trust effective at the start of 2018 with respect to the liquidity coverage ratio northern trust is above the applicable 100 minimum requirement as northern trust progresses through fully phased in basel iii implementation there could be additional enhancements to our models and further guidance from the regulators on the implementation of the final rule which could change the calculation of our regulatory ratios under the final basel iii rules yesterday we announced a 0 05 increase to our quarterly dividend from 0 55 to 0 60 this represents a 9 sequential increase and an increase of 43 on a year over year basis during the fourth quarter we also repurchased 2 5 million shares of common stock at a cost of 235 million now i would like to turn the call over to mike for some closing comments michael o grady president and chief executive officer thanks biff good morning everyone before we open up the call for questions i wanted to offer some closing comments regarding 2018 the three primary objectives for our strategies are to continuously enhance client service improve our productivity and grow profitably in 2018 we executed multiple initiatives and made significant investments in order to make meaningful progress on all three objectives for example we executed on an important initiative to realign some of our operations and technology functions in order to enhance the client experience by better aligning ourselves and our activities with client needs in our business strategies we can see early benefits of this realignments as we can effectively and efficiently serve clients end to end and be more nimble in this rapidly changing environment as biff highlighted we have made considerable progress toward our value for spend goal of achieving expense run rate savings of 250 million by 2020 throughout the company we ve made a commitment to making a value oriented mindset and ongoing aspect of how we conduct our business we re investing meaningfully in technology in our talent in wealth management we are expanding the capabilities of our goals driven wealth management platform and we continue to hire talent in focused growth areas in asset management we expanded our product offerings including the development of new etf and alternatives products and in c is in conjunction with

begin 2019 we re excited about our competitive positioning within each of our businesses we remain focused on providing clients with exceptional service improving our productivity and driving profitable growth thank you again for participating in northern trust s fourth quarter earnings conference call today biff mark and i would be happy to answer your questions april you can open up the line questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions and we ll first hear from michael carrier of bank of america michael carrier bank of america analyst hi thanks guys biff maybe first one just for you when you mentioned some of the lagging pricing on some of the assets and just given the period end you just wanted to get maybe an update on how you re thinking about the expense the outlook for 2019 and beyond you gave the update on the value for spend but just how it maybe a lower revenue environment can you dial areas back versus what you re going to kind of remain in investment mode for longer term growth stephen biff bowman executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah mike maybe it d be helpful on the call if i walk through the lag in the lag impacts first and then we ll talk about the expense reactions to that because i think there are some important information here first if you look at our fees as a firm if i look at our c is business first i ll start there approximately 60 of the fees are equity market sensitive or sensitive to asset they re asset sensitive they re they move with markets and so 40 down if you look at our custody and fund administration line then for those that are sensitive about 70 to 75 of our fees are on a month lagged basis okay that means 25 to 30 are on a quarter lag basis in the past i know we ve talked more about 50 50 in that lag but our mix has shifted between our global fund services business at our traditional iit business inaudible institutional investor businesses and so that is more of a 75 70 to 75 is on a month lag and 25 or so is on a quarter lag in our custody and fund administration fees in c is investment management fees which about 40 of the fees are sensitive to equity markets about 50 is daily but the vast majority of that is in cash funds about 40 is quarter lagged but more heavily exposed to equity and then 10 or so is on a month lagged basis if you go to our wealth management business it s more aligned with where we traditionally talked it has not moved as much but roughly if you look at our global family office about 65 to 70 of the fees are quarter lagged 25 of those percent are daily 25 is daily and 5 to 10 is in a month lag and then if you look at our wealth management regions about 70 are on a month lag basis 20 are on a daily basis and 10 are on a quarter lag basis i hope that s important for everyone so they can understand sort of the lag nature of our business for fees to give you some color i think the rest of your question was really then around the with that kind of backdrop what can we do from an expense standpoint and i ll take a quick stab and mike might have a few comments that he wants to add as well from an expense standpoint the first thing i d say is we continue to focus as a firm on the organic trajectory of our businesses so that s important to us what we think we can grow organically and what we can grow our expenses organically but we re not immune from considering the macro factors in our expense run rate as well the way we look at it is this we have certain inflationary pressures on our expense base but we think about generating productivity through things like value for spend or other forms of productivity that has to at least offset that inflation in our model that leaves us with expenses in our view that are there to support the organic growth rate that i talked about and or to invest in our businesses and we calibrate those so that we generate organic leverage from what we think we will get on the organic growth rate so that s the framework we think about expenses and we do think that if we get that right we drive the productivity and drive the productivity as hard as we can that we can still create that leverage even in an environment where we do see some volatility on the fee line or volatility in the markets michael o grady president and chief executive officer yeah i would just add to what biff said that over time we have the financial models that biff described there and so it s important that we continue to execute on that over time having said that you also have to navigate the environment that you re in at that particular point in time and clearly the environment right now is more volatile than it was say a year ago and so that does mean being very careful in thinking about how we manage the expense base for the business as we go through this market environment so being relatively tight if you will as we go through that and focusing on these longer term productivity initiatives that we ve had in place importantly as biff talked about a year ago or before that the environment was relatively strong and that s when we launched into value for spend and the point is that we didn t want to wait for a more challenging environment to say ok now we need to come up with ways to reduce the expense base so it s both through cycles if you will but then also trying to be mindful of the environment that you re in michael carrier bank of america analyst okay that s helpful and then maybe just a quick follow up just on the organic growth outlook i think you guys have been in that call it 4 to 5 range overtime given what you re seeing in terms of the investment opportunities and maybe some of the competitive dynamics in the industry like are you still comfortable with that type of outlook just given some of the dynamics in the industry has anything i guess changed from that perspective michael o grady president and chief executive officer why don t i start with this it s mike so from an organic growth perspective we still are targeting the range that you talked about there and i would say right now in the past year we were toward the low end of that range and there s a number of dynamics around that and maybe just to break it down a little bit by by our businesses starting with asset management i don t need to go through all the dynamics facing that business but that s a business that has seen its organic growth rate come down and in the past year basically we were flat as far as organic growth in the business so a little bit negative on flows and picked up a little bit on fee realization through mix but essentially at flat that s going to dilute the overall organic growth rate for us if you look at the asset servicing part of the business which has been growing at a higher organic growth rate it continues to grow at the same level that it s been at in 2018 it was again toward the lower end of that range but if you think about that it s being roughly half of the fees and the range for them being 5 to 6 overtime and toward the lower end still a healthy rate for that business and i d be glad to kind of break that down further as to what we saw in 2018 and then the wealth management business again different set of dynamics which i won t go through but has been at a lower organic growth rate and so even separating out the impact of asset management products in that business the fee organic fee growth rate has been more on kind of the 2 to 3 range for that and we were roughly in that range for the year so when you do the weighted average of that that s where you come out to again toward the lower end of what you re talking about but if you said strategically what are we trying to do well we re trying to execute on strategies and target markets where we think that we have an opportunity to maintain that growth rate operator next we ll hear from brennan hawken of ubs brennan hawken ubs investment bank analyst good morning thanks for taking the question you spoke to the lag effect which is helpful to get a refresher on in great depth thanks for that biff just curious if you could comment on the fee rate so we saw it rebound from the third quarter where you had some transactional headwinds thinking about that looking forward how should we consider fee rate in each of your businesses might the lag effect that you walk through not only have an impact on the calculation of the auc dynamics and aum dynamics but also the fee rate and how should we calibrate that as we move into 2019 thanks both considering the drop in 4q and then the rebound here quarter to date that we ve seen in march mark bette director of investor relations hi brennan it s mark i ll take a first shot of that part of it would be the when you re doing the true average of september 30 to december 31 auc a or even aum in wealth management you are picking up at end of period number that s going to be lower for the asset even though the fees haven t fully reflected that yet we did see in the fund administration under custody and fund administration we did see a little bit of a pickup from transactions that would have helped there as well moving forward and as we ve talked about that it s a really as that the custody and fund admin ph is a tough one to look at fee rates just because of the mix of businesses that you bring on and that every asset is not equal so it s really about bringing on services doing as much as you can for every dollar of asset on the wealth side i would say as we ve talked about before if you looked at the regions within wealth management split let s say roughly evenly between product asset management and the advisory fees the advisory component has actually held up pretty well and we look to stay competitive in that area and then on the product side we haven t quite seen the declines that we ve been seeing and if you went back 18 months ago or so but overall i think part of the fee realization might be the fact that the assets are fully reflecting in the fourth quarter markets whereas the fees don t quite maybe have that yet brennan hawken ubs investment bank analyst okay so maybe we re going to be looking at some fee rate pressure that s subject to a lag that it seems like that s what you re saying there mark thanks for that and then i wanted to circle back on on the expense question mike it seems as though you had said that and it seems like this is a bit of a different approach than what we ve heard from northern in years passed is that while you guys came up with your values for spend program making hay while the sun was shining so to speak as you enter into a period where you have a potentially more volatile equity market environment maybe less helpful better tailwinds you are going to be diligent in investments and the expense line so as to adjust for potential headwinds that might come through is that a fair conclusion there or am i reading too much into what you said michael o grady president and chief executive officer well i m not i m suggesting that you read more into it that s what i m saying having said that i do think that s a fair characterization so we recognize the importance as i said of just continually improving our productivity so it s not a good market bad market thing and that s why we wanted to put more i d say structure and focused around value for spend going back a year or plus ago in addition to that though when you answer in environment like this just as you said i think it s a good point there are other expenses that are discretionary if you will so the level of investment spending that you re making theoretically you can say well we re just going to flat out invest through the cycle we re not pulling anything back and on the other side you can say we re going to completely pull back on all investments in order to just get the expense growth rate down and i think you hit on it when you said yes we can look at those categories and say not just whether we re going to do them but what is the pacing for that do we need to see a little bit more into 2019 before we continue on certain investments and there s sorry for the expression but there is no such thing as a free lunch if you a delay on something well you re delaying on something and if you don t make that investment well then you re taking the risk for future revenue so those are the type of decisions that we have to make but it is acknowledging that we do have discretion around those so let s try to manage those for the environment that we re in as well operator next we ll hear from alex blostein of goldman sachs alexander blostein goldman sachs co analyst thanks hey good morning everybody question for you guys around pricing terms in the servicing business obviously i m sure as you heard from inaudible last week sounds like the pressure has accelerated on a bunch of parts of the ecosystem here so curious what you guys seeing in terms of pricing institutional servicing there s always been obviously the mix is different and also there s also been some element of pricing pressure but really just trying to get a sense of whether or not you re seeing any acceleration and kind of pricing degradation here and then separately can you help us get a flavor for the makeup of your customer base with c is between us non us asset managers hedge funds et cetera michael o grady president and chief executive officer sure alex it s mike i ll start off so the way i would characterize the environment that we ve been in and i think we re still in is an environment where there is more activity and what i mean by that is whether it s asset owners or asset managers for different reasons are definitely looking at what they re doing and how they re doing it and there are implications from that so what does that mean on the asset owners side of the equation you have very large asset owners that have managed their capital or their investment in a certain way in other words have they completely outsourced it to external managers or have they done some internally and frankly we re seeing those types of organizations look at going both directions and we ve seen the impact of that so some of the larger ones saying we re going to do more in house because we think that s a better way for us as a scale manager of investments when they do that they have different data needs and different capability needs so a lot of time spent around the technology and what we can provide to them apis i think database things like that and again depending on what you can offer versus competitors et cetera it can change the dynamic but there s more activity around that second i would say with other asset owners they ve actually looked at it the opposite way and we saw some of the impact of that in 2018 where as an asset owner that has done more in house they ve said frankly that s not our business if you will in other words large corporate pension plan saying we re not going to continue to operate a large in house investment team instead we re going to go more external we re going to go more passive that s lower cost and our objective is to get to the right answer for the client and so in doing that these are still clients but what we do for them is less and we will see some fee impact from that as you shift to asset managers there has been a lot of discussion on obviously the pressure on asset managers and therefore their primary objective of looking at the cost of these types of services they ve also when their asset base they ve seen the cost go up in an absolute dollar perspective so they do look to see if they can reduce costs there are different ways to get there whether it s just negotiation with their provider or do they go out and do just an rfi or do they go to rfp and what are the results of that so as a result of all that i would say more activity now if you looked at 2018 for us as a result of more activity i would say our gross business one if you will was toward the high end of the rates that we have been at so in that sense good number the net as i mentioned before toward the lower end of the range and then if you say ok how do you break out the negative or the lost business in that the largest portion of it so say in the neighbourhood of 3 from a rate perspective was more toward lost or repositioned and i should add into that certainly you see flows change in the impact of flows so if we re the custodian for a very large sovereign wealth fund that we do it for equities and they switch out of equities then we re going to see the impact of that so you did see more funds flow and more activity there when you say lost business did you lose a lot and why did you lose it again i would say every situation a little bit different in certain cases do we lose through the process because the competitor does a better job it certainly is going to be the case we d like to win them all but we don t win them all and obviously we re up against the best in this business and at times could it be because of pricing and that they ve either to retain the business they ve gotten very aggressive on pricing or in this case to win it away that s certainly part of it but i would not tell you that we ve seen overly aggressive pricing by competitors in order to win business on i would say it s consistent with where we ve been we ve tried to be very disciplined around our own pricing and again i would say that we ve seen some impact but not dramatic so when you take the kind of repricing component it s going to be more in the neighbourhood of 1 5 to 2 of what we saw this year from a rate perspective so you re going to have that as you mentioned all the time in the marketplace whether it s a little bit higher or lower but for us i wouldn t say that part of it has been dramatically different and then i m going to let mark address the second part of your question mark bette director of investor relations yeah as far as the mix when we look at c is and you re right we don t publish the actual segments within c is but when we look at it roughly about half of c is is the fund services business which is where our asset managers would be and that s we don t break out that between traditional but within that you have traditional asset managers you have hedge funds you have private equity funds i would say that our gfs business is larger in emea than in the united states so that hopefully gives you some flavor for the makeup of the fund services alexander blostein goldman sachs co analyst great that s very helpful thanks guys and then my second question just around expenses maybe frame it a little bit differently but i guess if i look at your core expense base in 2018 net of these severance charges in the couple of things you highlighted it looks like we are running a little bit below 4 billion and assuming that you kind of continue to aspire to grow the business organically and kind of the 4 to 5 range is that a fair way to think about the growth and expenses of that sub 4 billion number for 2019 michael o grady president and chief executive officer yeah at the highest level alex i would say yes so in other words that we re responsible for all the expenses right so we could we do break them down and cut them every way you could possibly think of but at the end of the day we re responsible for all of them we aspire to do a little bit better than that number in the year from an internal target perspective mystify a little bit for various reasons not from a value for spend or productivity perspective but from some of the other things that biff mentioned in his commentary there but that s kind of the base if you will and then going forward again it should be aligned with the organic growth rate in the fees and so to the extent we can stay in the range that we talked about from a fee growth perspective then yes then that s what you would expect from an expense perspective to the extent that that goes down for whatever reason then we have to look at how do we bring that organic growth rate on the expense side down with it operator and next we ll hear from glenn schorr of evercore glenn schorr evercore isi analyst hi thanks michael o grady president and chief executive officer hi glenn glenn schorr evercore isi analyst hello just one little follow up on the pricing discussion has anything dramatically changed in terms of client contracts in other words like the public money coming up every year or two and the rest of the world having five to seven year role so maybe something like 15 to 20 of clients come up each year is that am i in the ballpark on that michael o grady president and chief executive officer yeah glenn i would say for certain clients you do have i ll call it more locked in term that s generally where there is more of an investment upfront for the on boarding but in most of these contracts there is generally a notice period six months notice or something like that so we re not counting on just the contractual term and the fact that they would be locked in and i would say this is particularly with some of your more traditional asset management business i they have the ability to accelerate it so has that gone has that sped up a little bit again i haven t looked at anything analytically but as i mentioned before i think we ve just seen more activity as they ve looked at their situation i ll call it glenn schorr evercore isi analyst and maybe you could talk to the good part of growth in your in response from i think it was mike s first question you talked about that 4 to 5 asset growth and you dangled a little bit of if you want more i ll give you more on what clients are driving could we talk a little bit about what clients are driving it michael o grady president and chief executive officer well if i understand the question just peeling it back level as to where we re targeting in order to have a higher organic growth rate maybe starting with the asset servicing business we have benefited from our focus on alternative managers so for us particularly hedge funds and our hedge fund services business has grown at a higher rate and again we ll continue to focus there and we think there is opportunity in the other parts of the alternative space for us both for the market itself but then for our position there we also believe on the asset owner side with what we would call the more complex asset owners so this is to my previous comments about asset owners that are doing more asset management if you will on their own they tend to be asset owners that have high allocations to private to some extent hedge fund but also significantly in private equity infrastructure et cetera they have a different set of needs and therefore we ve been focused on how can we meet those needs with technology and a service model and you saw the investment we made in a technology company that was part of it that was really to join up with what we ve been developing on our own but we see greater growth in that segment i thinking about luxembourg obviously we did the acquisition there but the fund services markets both ireland and in luxembourg are both healthy but i would say for us in particular luxembourg has been and we think will grow at a higher rate for us just given our position there which is lower position and now moving up in the ranks there and we did see that and then just shifting over to wealth management on the wealth management side again we think that our value proposition resonates particularly well as the level of complexity goes up for the client or the prospects so ultra high net worth when i talk about goals driven wealth management the platform that s behind that the technology that is geared more toward the ultra high net worth and so we ve seen a higher level of growth in that area and we ll continue to do it and then likewise you see the numbers in global family office and i ll say that s beyond just keep doing a good job there s been some very specific strategic initiatives in that business that are working very effectively so in particular we looked at the technology there and we upgraded our technology offering both the ability to do partnership accounting just being a little bit technical but then also what we can offer as far as analytics so we have something called anchor analytics that again is resonating very well with existing clients but also prospects and then i would just also say in wealth management from a market perspective we ve talked many times about certain markets where we have lower market presence like in new york like in texas where we see higher growth rates for us and that s not to diminish the growth from some of our more mature markets like florida here here in the midwest and then just to close out in in asset management a significant focus around the areas again where we think we can grow faster like etfs and quant active which are not the larger parts of our assets under management base but where we see greater growth potential for us so hopefully that gives you some of the areas that we re focused on operator next we ll hear from steven chubak of wolfe research steven chubak wolfe research analyst hi good morning so wanted to start off with a question on the securities portfolio you mentioned the duration of the securities book very conservatively believe the duration now is just a little above one year and with the conversation now shifting from fed tightening to likely fed pause and there i say even fed easing cycle i was wondering whether you might consider locking in some duration or maybe mitigate some of those nii pressures in anticipation of possible fed using in the future stephen biff bowman executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah steve thanks this is biff so the answer to that is we have our asset liability committee meets regularly and frequently and what you just described is a key input to our decision making and certainly an item that we re considering given the balance of risks now between future rate increases and either no rate increases or even a reversal of the trends we had we do that on a regular basis we have that conversation at all times and we ve benefited as you see from the growth in our net interest income over time from that short duration but internal debates and views on what may happen in the future is something we consider as a general rule over time we ve always had a reasonably short but there is the ability to look at how we want to position and i can assure you that is actively discussed and regularly discussed internally and will continue to be and as we look at what is i think now a more balanced picture in terms of what may happen in terms of fed future fed increases and or at some point maybe even a reversal of that trend but we re certainly looking at it and you can see those kinds of things in some of our disclosures in the qs and ks where we look at the sensitivity of net interest income to those factors steven chubak wolfe research analyst understood and just one follow up for me on capital management one of your peers recently increased our capital return with a mid cycle ask you guys have incredibly robust capital ratios i m just wondering if that s something that you would consider pursuing and maybe any insight into how you are thinking around long term capital targets has evolved i know you tried to stay at least in the ballpark with some of your peers that you compete with for rfps from the looks of things are actually above many of those peers today i m just curious how you re thinking about managing to an explicit long term capital target or what you think is a reasonable expectation from here stephen biff bowman executive vice president and chief financial officer sure so with regards to well first of all we did a dividend increase yesterday which was something that we had had in our capital plan as from last year not public here until yesterday but we did do that but the way we think about capital and the way the firm thinks about capital is first do we have enough to support our growth second do we have enough to support ourselves through times of high stress do we have enough to maintain very high ratios and ratings and then do we have enough to support a competitive position in the marketplace so that we can compete against others to win that business i think the answer to all of those is yes that we are strongly and well capitalized at this position and so as we think about entering the capital planning cycle and the submissions are due first part of april we enter those from a position of strength that gives us a great deal of flexibility in our thinking and we do look at the competitive environment in terms of where we are that s one of the four items i just highlighted for you do we think about our position vis a vis the others but we think we re very well capitalized right now and are focused on thinking that through and our capital ask at the regulators in terms of what we ask kind of in the mid period at this point we think we ve got a plan at this point in time that we re going to continue to execute on in the remainder of this quarter and the remainder of the second quarter and will submit in april but it is it s a strong position that we enter the capital planning cycle and submission from and it allows us to think about our returns with great flexibility operator brian bedell of deutsche bank brian bedell deutsche bank analyst great thanks for taking my questions maybe just to circle back to wealth management mike i think you ve said that right now that organic growth rate is low is low single digit in the 2 to 3 area maybe if you can just talk about whether you think that s more of a regional focus in terms of improving that or rather more of the capabilities that you re talking about and then also just what the client behavior is trending like in wealth management given we re seeing more volatile markets and moving more to cash and then can you accelerate your own investment product within the open architecture platform across that business michael o grady president and chief executive officer okay brian a couple embedded ones in so make sure i get on hit on all of them as far as the growth i would say i m going to call across the business so both within the regions but also in global family office i did highlight some of the things we re doing in global family office but that s not to say that that s the only area where we see opportunity to increase that organic growth rate and in fact when i talk about goals driven wealth management ultra high net worth that s in the region if you will so good opportunities across the markets and when we look at trying to increase that and i would also just say part of that is i m going call it addition through subtraction just meaning we have a higher gross new business rate it s just that you also have to deal with the flows and people pay their taxes and things like that nets you down to that 2 or 3 so we re trying to just get to the best net number that we have that we can get i think the second part was just about client behavior and i would say you re absolutely right when we talk about volatile markets et cetera the first thing that we think about is how do we make sure we re very close to the client and i d managing the situation with them and i would say so far that we haven t seen a lot of dramatic behavior or changes and i would say that that s particularly because that s the driving objective behind goals driven wealth management is keeping them focused on what are their goals what are their objectives and we ve put together a portfolio that support those goals and it gives you the ability to go through volatile situations like this without being over reactive and quickly moving out of equities only to then miss the opportunity when it goes back up again i will say in addition to that we do provide our strategic and tactical allocation portfolios from asset management to our wealth management clients and they do tactically move in last year i think appropriately and move to more of a neutral position earlier in the year and then more recently in the beginning of this year moved back to a more balanced position by increasing the allocation to risk assets so once again trying to see through cycles for our clients but then also being mindful of what s happening on a tactical basis as well brian bedell deutsche bank analyst are you able to get more of northern trust investment managed product within that asset allocation performer are using or you re using more of an open architecture approach michael o grady president and chief executive officer yeah so i would say everything i talked about there is agnostic to the product at asset management itself northern trust has is certainly trying to develop products that meet the needs of clients but that s the only time that those two would come together so i talked about etfs and being focused on etfs part of the success there is they ve designed products that we think meet with the goals and objectives of our clients but it s that direction if you will i ll call it top down not something the other way operator betsy graseck of morgan stanley betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst hi good morning how are you michael o grady president and chief executive officer hi good morning stephen biff bowman executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst so just a couple of follow up questions here i heard earlier about the conversation around price pressure 1 5 to 2 in line with what you ve been seeing for a while now i guess i m wondering if you could give us a sense mike what that range of pressure is on and just a couple of key either client types or product sets that you offer i guess i m thinking that maybe it s a little bit heavier on some of the more equity mutual funds and it might be lighter if at all on alternatives but maybe that s wrong i d just like to get your sense on that michael o grady president and chief executive officer yeah betsy so i m not going to be in a position to give you a product by product breakdown on where they are more or less i mean i think in general as i said it s more about activity than it is about everybody just driving to lower cost per se and as much as we know that there s a lot of pressure on asset managers and maybe you would say particularly certain categories of traditional asset managers that doesn t mean that a hedge fund is not focused on their expense base as well it s probably more acute in the traditional asset management space i would say that but i know that doesn t mean that we re immune in other categories as well and as i mentioned on the asset owners space as well they certainly do look at the fees that they pay in order to custody and administer the assets and so it s not again just an asset manager phenomenon it s something that you have to anticipate which once again goes back to if you know that that s going to be the case overtime what do you do strategically and i think importantly the first thing we do is we want to make sure we re providing value right because the value is going to support the fees that you re paying it s also going to lock you more into that client relationship then we re also going to look at productivity both in general as i talked about but within the client how can we be as productive as possible and sometimes it goes the other way which is to look at the value we re providing look at the fees we re getting and frankly if it s the other direction then we have to have that conversation with the client about the fee that they re paying relative to the service that we re providing to them so i know that doesn t necessarily give you the specificity that you re probably looking for but that would be my perspective betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst got it i know you can t give i was just looking for whether or not there was a range we could talk about but i get your point i guess the other question i had mike was just on in the conversations you re having with both existing and prospective clients what do you see as some of the biggest pain points that clients have frictions to solve that you re focused on addressing say over the next year or so michael o grady president and chief executive officer so if it s institutional clients i would say that on the asset owners side the primary pain point is around data right and so they re primarily trying to assess and determine for themselves what is the appropriate data model for them to have data operating model and when you say well what does that mean well it would be easy to say i want perfect data that s real time i we can provide that essentially but in providing that that is a higher cost model to be able to provide that to them as opposed to a model that is either on a daily basis or some other basis ok and the point on that is it s worthwhile for the client if they are actively managing their investments so higher cost but they would view it as more than make up for it because we are actively managing the assets and that could be either directly in the market investing it could be active with managers and it could be also what we would consider overlay strategies right where they want to be able to quickly shift their asset allocation but to do that they need essentially real time information in order to be able to do that now as i hopefully laid out there there is a spectrum there of both what the needs are and what we can offer and so it s not a one size fits all for all of those clients and that s the dialog so with each client you really have to assess where they are and what they are trying to achieve and then as a result do they have the right offering for them and then i would say on the asset manager side this is where we re investing significantly in our fund services platform meaning both fund accounting and transfer agency to really make that much more of a digital experience for the client and if you think about what we re doing there we re helping our clients being the asset manager service their clients and so they are trying to provide a digital experience to their client while they can t do it unless we can provide it to them as well so that s where the investment has been in trying to solve that pain point if you will for their dealing with their client so hopefully that s helpful betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst very much thanks operator ken usdin of jefferies has our next question ken usdin jefferies analyst thanks hey guys if you don t mind i might just clean up a couple of questions biff you mentioned in your prepared remarks when you re talking about the auc that the quarter you had a transition out of a large custody client i know just wondering can you help us try to understand of the 7 decline roughly just how much of that was and if in fact the revenue from that client was also already out of the quarter s run rate stephen biff bowman executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so we referred to one large client transition out during the quarter you re right and that was it was a us large corporate client and that was primarily a us corporate cash custody relationship when you look at it in our trend report i think glenn you ll be able to see that the drop of about 91 billion that you ll see in auc in fixed income within c is that s a reasonable indicator of the magnitude that s a pretty good explanation of that and then in terms of the fees michael o grady president and chief executive officer it s partial stephen biff bowman executive vice president and chief financial officer it s partially yeah it was partially transition so there it was partially it was that s what mark has talked about not all auc is created equal and there is different fee structures associated with some of that so but it was it makes enough movement in the fixed income space that we called it out here ken usdin jefferies analyst understood ok and then just a couple of little ones there are a couple of good like pluses and minuses throughout the fees and expenses and i m wondering can you help us to the extent you can clarify what the leasing gains software charge and the magnitude of what it sounded like a little higher servicing errors perhaps on the other expenses it seem like there was some lumpy stuff and a bunch of items any help you can help us in trying to get some starting points thanks stephen biff bowman executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah you can on the leasing side in the quarter there was approximately 5 million worth of the gain and we didn t call that out explicitly because over the course of the year there are gains and losses of that in the quarter and interestingly enough over the course of the year they kind of wash through so we at that magnitude haven t necessarily called them out given their size on the expense side the items that i would call out on the software charge that we talked about if you look at the sequential increase for us which i believe was just under 7 million in equipment and software i think it s fair to say that that was essentially all attributable to the software charge so that gives you some idea of the magnitude of the charge but it was largely that was driven there and then in terms of the cost associated with client servicing we tend to look at that line item which is you know sits in other expense over the course of the year it is fair to say that in this quarter that was higher than our normal run rate and meaningfully higher than that but if you look at that line over the course of the year it reverted closer to where we see it it was a little higher we called it out and the fourth quarter was indeed higher but hopefully that gives you some color on what those were inside of other expense which is a compilation of a lot of different moving parts we had fdic expense move in our favor by let s say 5 million to 5 5 million in the quarter but we had these larger expenses associated with servicing clients meaningfully above the run rate the normal run rate in there more than offsetting that and then we have a lot of other items like value added tax that kind of all moved that item around i think it s probably better to look at other expense over the course of the year and look at the average of those run rates operator next we ll hear from jim mitchell of buckingham research james mitchell the buckingham research group analyst hey good morning maybe just a question on the balance sheet and deposit flows it seems like noninterest bearing and interest bearing both kind of stable quarter over quarter you do you think the flows the outflows particularly noninterest bearing are starting to come to an end should we start to think about deposit growth yet or is do it is still think given where rates are that deposits continue to trend down just wanted to get a sense of how you re thinking about it stephen biff bowman executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so we did see the stabilization particularly in the non interest bearing line item from the in the quarter i think it was down about 200 million so essentially a flat noninterest bearing movement and as we discussed last quarter when we look at that bucket and the nature of the makeup for that bucket we think that a lot of the most rate sensitive money had already sought other return seeking products whether those were within northern trust or somewhere else so we feel reasonably confident that bucket has reached at least a current level where rates are right now and in particular if we don t have any future rate hikes we think that there could be some stability in that in the interest bearing portion of the deposits while it was flattish from what you can see here there was some movement down and interest bearing that we then can bolster with wholesale funding or others not a lot a little over between 1 billion and 2 billion we view that more as normal operational movements that we would see among our clients as they reposition their portfolios reposition their cash that is much more a function of the interest bearing to us is much more a function of the growth of our business where we growing our asset servicing relationships and we just generally see our balance sheet grow can we see deposit growth i think we can see deposit growth if we see our asset servicing businesses continue to grow and our wealth businesses continue to grow we should be able to see that counterbalancing that is any actions that may be going on among the fed in terms of the tone balance sheet management activities which can put some pressures on it but generally we ve seen now a couple of quarters of some balance sheet stabilization in terms of balances james mitchell the buckingham research group analyst right and if as we think about continued organic growth in that mid single digit range that s kind of where you d like you think that sort of an intermediate term goal in terms of deposit growth stephen biff bowman executive vice president and chief financial officer it s not always one for one on that in terms of the balance sheet growth because it depends on the nature of the the organic fee growth we re getting for instance we could win fund administration and other type businesses where we don t necessarily have the custody and we may not actually get balances the comp but we get fees so it isn t necessarily one to one with that but it is growth where we get traditional auc there s generally some balance sheet growth that could come with that so i don t know that i would quite put it if the peg it at the levels you talked about but it could grow from there james mitchell the buckingham research group analyst okay thanks operator brian kleinhanzl of kbw brian kleinhanzl keefe bruyette woods inc analyst hey good morning guys stephen biff bowman executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning michael o grady president and chief executive officer good morning brian kleinhanzl keefe bruyette woods inc analyst a quick question on if the fed does pause given where we re at with the deposit pricing and those kind of seeing some upward pressure there i mean if the fed doesn t move next year do you still think that you can see some margin movement i mean just assuming that the balance sheet stays flat or we at this point in the time you re almost liability sensitive stephen biff bowman executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah if all things being equal here if everything else is equal we do think that there could still be some nim expansion with no fed rate hikes but the pace of that growth and the pace of that we ll be subject to the asset repricing that we have we still have some assets that will roll some of that need to be repriced so we do think there could still be some nim expansion but probably get a more measured pace in terms of liability pricing with no future fed rate hikes we don t see at this point a meaningful need to continue to have see upward pressure on deposit pricing there might be some modest amounts somewhere in the portfolio on the margins but not broadly across the portfolio we think we re at or near market competitive levels brian kleinhanzl keefe bruyette woods inc analyst okay and this is a separate one on taxes looks like you ended the year kind of a low point for the tax rate and that s excluding the some of one timer that you called out already in the presentation how you think about the tax rate down as you go through 2019 that we re able to adjust your go forward tax rate down because of the guidance at the choice ph you put out thanks stephen biff bowman executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i still think at this point in time the 23 to 24 range that we ve given you is where we would suggest you think about our 2019 operator next we ll hear from gerard cassidy of rbc gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst good morning stephen biff bowman executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst can you guys share with us you ve talked about biff transitioning some folks into lower cost markets from your higher cost labor markets how much more can you do that i mean are your 50 there 90 there were there s not much more you can do in transitioning people into these lower cost markets michael o grady president and chief executive officer i m glad to start on that one gerard so i think it s appropriate observation in one that we ve had for some time because it has been a it has provided a significant benefit to us over the last several years i mean going back 12 years 13 years ago when we first started what i would consider location strategy to actually move functions into different geographies and that has matured over time how we think about that so biff in his commentary had mentioned some of the different locations those locations are not all the same so what we do in bangalore for example is different than what we may do in manila or what we do in limerick or tempe and so we ve evolved it in that way the third thing i would say is that we ve been growing as we ve talked about we have a higher growth rate in our businesses in particularly in asset servicing which requires more people for it and so really what it s enabled us to do as opposed to moving positions over it s that we essentially absorb the growth in those locations and then to kind of wrap up with the answer to your question there s still opportunity both because of the growth and where it happens but also certain functions that still have not fully matured into where their appropriate location is but acknowledging that and saying well then what does it mean if you re closer to the end i ll call it of location strategy and then the beginning and that s why we talk about automation and robotics and what we can do from that perspective and we have a number of initiatives under way that are part of value per spend where we are looking to automate the functions as opposed to necessarily moving them to a different location and the view is that that creates even more scalability than in our model gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst very good then as a follow up mike you guys obviously are very well capitalized you ve had a successful acquisition strategy over multiple years of buying different businesses and integrating them into your organization as the markets remain maybe more volatile pressures on revenues are across the board does it make sense to look at acquisition opportunities maybe in a more heightened fashion or maybe that hasn t changed and you have been looking you just haven t really found anything michael o grady president and chief executive officer so as we ve talked about on the call we re all very cognizant there are a lot of negative aspects of volatile or down markets and having said that as biff articulated well with regard to capital now is a particularly good time to have a strong capital base and is part of the strategy with regard to capital because it does provide us the flexibility in these types of conditions to both be more opportunistic to your point on acquisitions if they are attractive for us and to be able to have the flexibility around our capital returns so the answer is that we yes we are always looking at acquisitions that can accelerate our strategies and often we re not able to execute on those because of the market i e high valuations and then you are presented with the opportunity because of the environment that either strategically competitively certain companies may have issues that then present themselves as opportunities for us or from a pricing valuation perspective it just becomes more attractive operator next we ll hear from mike mayo of wells fargo securities mike mayo wells fargo securities analyst hi whether you intended to or not i think you re coming across a little cautious on this call so i just wanted to ask you was that your intention going into the call and specifically when you add it all up do you guys expect to show revenue growth faster than expense growth in 2019 and your roe target i m not sure if you updated that are not but it was 10 to 15 and you reported 16 in 2018 so is there caution is that the reason why you re not raising your roe target or am i just missing something here thanks michael o grady president and chief executive officer sure it s mike i ll address both of those so first of all as far as the tone we didn t come in with an objective for a particular tone this is just the way that we re looking at the business and the environment et cetera but needless to say i mean i would say we re certainly optimistic about our position from a competitive perspective and our ability to serve clients and to continue to grow and produce attractive returns for our shareholders more specifically to your questions with regard to organic growth fees and expenses i would say in 2018 the objective was to have those in line as we ve talked about and we came up a little bit shy of that so we did not meet our target now almost were there and there were certain aspects of as to why that happened and again we own all the expenses so it s more reasons as opposed to excuses and then coming into this year absolutely the objective is the same on an organic basis now there s a lot of things we can t control we talked about the markets how it effects our fees things like that but the view is if we can produce it on an organic basis and you have a year like 2018 that produces i think 1 6 points of fee operating leverage so that remains the same and that s our objective and then as far as roe we haven t changed the range per se but i would definitely say that has not limited us in our aspirations or targeting so we had 16 this year and certainly are not afraid to target for ourselves doing better absent knowing what is going to happen in the environment and i would say now it s a particularly difficult time to say all right should you recast the range when part of the reason why we re above the range frankly is because of tax reform a year ago which boosted the roe hopefully that stays in place but again there is nothing certain on that front and then also the markets and everything we ve talked about here we tried to have a range that was through the markets hopefully we re not at the top end of that for it but we don t find the range itself to be constraining on our activities or aspirations and finally i would say for shareholders we re trying to produce the most attractive combination of growth and returns so as i ve said many times if it was just about the returns there is probably some things we could do to pull back on spending and investing and things like that and in the short term get it up but over the long term not create as much value for shareholders and so how do we make sure we re balancing growth with returns particularly when we re at a relatively attractive levels stephen biff bowman executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah and whether if i could add here i would say mike tonally there was no preview of let s have this be cautious what it was is us just talking about the environment we re operating in right now but i think as mike said he is optimistic about the positioning of our businesses and the opportunities to grow organically and i would say he and i are both and the board and everyone is equally optimistic about the financial strength with which we entered this period of uncertainty and volatility we have a strong balance sheet we have good liquidity and we re well positioned to take advantages of the opportunity that type of volatility can put in front of us so whether you call that caution or optimism i think that gives us a great array of opportunities but we are entering a period of time that looks different then say previous five six seven eight year positive equity run and at least the last three or four with upward sloping rate likelihood so i there was no intention to be tonally cautious just factually the environment we re operating in but business positioning i think mike and i would both agree financial strength and strategic product and execution strength are pretty high michael o grady president and chief executive officer our objective is to deliver on the results stephen biff bowman executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah mike mayo wells fargo securities analyst all right thank you operator and that does conclude today s conference thank you all for your participation you may now disconnect duration 87 minutes call participants

european majors are trading generally higher today as eurozone will take the center of stage there are worries of deeper and longer than expected slowdown in the eurozone economy pmis from germany france and eurozone will provide some hints on economic performance at the start of the year ecb rate decision will for sure be the focus too in particular the tone of the post meeting press conference will likely turn more cautious if not dovish hence while euro is recovering there is risk of renewed selling ahead which might also drag down the swiss franc and to a lesser extent sterling on the other hand commodity currencies are generally lower despite lack of risk aversion in the markets australian dollar turns south after mixed job data strong in the headline by questionable in the

conference is a main focus for today no change is expected in monetary policy and the main refinancing rate will be held at 0 00 as recent economic data pointed to further weakness in the eurozone economy ecb president mario draghi might turn a bit more cautious or even dovish in the press conference market has already pushed back their expectations on the first rate hike to mid 2020 but ecb is still unlikely to make any change to the forward guidance that is ecb will reiterate that interest rates will stay at present level at least through summer of 2019 ecb probably would wait for more incoming data before making such a change here are some suggested previews on ecb boe haldane people to take finger of pause button if some brexit deal is done boe chief economist andy haldane said in a newspaper interview that if the economy continues to tick along as we expect then we might expect some further limited and gradual rises in particular if some brexit deal is done that would reduce uncertainty and we think cause people to take their finger of the pause button and do a bit more investment spending and if the economy begins to change direction we will be flexible in the face of that eu barnier opposing no deal brexit won t stop no deal brexit eu chief brexit negotiator michel barnier said yesterday that no deal brexit is now the default and preparing for a no deal scenario is more important now than ever even though i still hope that we can avoid this scenario he also warned that opposing no deal will not stop no deal from happening at the end of march to stop no deal another majority will have to emerge and he added this is the objective of the political consultations that theresa may has started and we hope sincerely we hope that this process will be successful meanwhile he also pointed out there are two possible ways to leave the eu number one an orderly withdrawal based on the agreement that we have built step by step with the uk over the last 18 months or number two a disorderly withdrawal leaving the eu without a deal is a default scenario and there appears to be a majority in the house of commons to oppose a no deal boc poloz timing of next rate hike depends on how the economy responds to the shocks boc governor stephen poloz reiterated that more rate hikes are warranted for the central bank but the timing would be data dependent and it will depend on how the economy responds to the shocks we ve described he referred to developments including canada s housing market trade tensions and import of lower oil prices in particular poloz noted the past increase interest rates could lead to slumping activity and the housing markets hasn t quite settled down he would like to see how the markets stabilize to know where we stand that s a sign taken then boc could opt for a pause for a while but poloz also defended past rate hikes of boc and some other central banks he noted we are at a stage in the cycle where it always looks like monetary policy is doing the wrong thing and given the economy is near its steady state interest rates also should be near their steady state but poloz emphasized that the actual level of the so called steady state or neutral rate is an open question boc estimates it to be 2 5 3 5 wh hassett said there will be a us china trade deal by march 1 white house economic adviser kevin hassett said yesterday he s confidence that us and china will reach a trade deal by march 1 deadline he said in a cnn interview that yes i am confident that it can happen that the talks are moving forward and there s a lot of progress to be made but it s a very strong situation right now and i think the chinese recognize that they ve got a big potential gain for coming up with a deal because as you mentioned their growth has really fallen off the cliff also hassett talked down the risk of government shut down on credit rating he said i don t think a downgrade is in play i don t think that there s any risk at all given how strong the economy is that we will be downgraded japan pmi manufacturing dropped to 50 exports drop steepest in over 2 5 years japan pmi manufacturing dropped to 50 0 in december down from 52 6 that also marked the end of the longest expansionary run for over a decade in particular exports decline at strongest pace in two and a half years and production scaled back for first time since july 2016 while confidence lowest in over six years joe hayes economist at ihs markit noted preliminary pmi data for january bodes ill for japan s manufacturing sector indicating the end of a near two and a half year growth run as the index dropped to 50 0 the underlying picture will raise concern given renewed reductions were seen in new orders and output further signs that the downturn in the global trade cycle could yet worsen were also signalled with new export orders falling at the sharpest rate since july 2016 the widely anticipated rebound in q4 should not distract from the bigger picture domestic economic weakness compounded with slowing global growth coincided with the lowest level of business confidence for over six years australia job growth driven by part time jobs participation rate fell australia job market grew 21 6k in december above expectation of 18 1k full time jobs however dropped 3k part time jobs rose 24 6k unemployment rate dropped 0 1 to 5 0 better than expectation of 5 0 that equals the lowest level in more than 6 years as touched back in september and october however participation rate dropped by 0 1 to 65 6 while the set of data was solid it isn t too encouraging and paints no sign of tightening in the australian job market looking ahead in addition to ecb rate decision and press conference eurozone will release pmis us will also release pmis and leading indicator eur usd daily outlook daily pivots s1 1 1356 p 1 1375 r1 1 1400 more eur usd s recovery today suggests temporary bottoming at 1 1336 as such recovery is weak so far we d treat is as a correction intraday bias is turned neutral first at this point we re still slightly favoring that corrective rise from 1 1215 should have completed at 1 1569 on the downside break of 1 1336 will resume the fall from 1 1569 to retest 1 1215 low however break of 1 1450 resistance will argue that the corrective pattern from 1 1215 is extending with another rise and intraday bias will be turned to the upside for 1 1569 and above in the bigger picture as long as 1 1814 resistance holds down trend down trend from 1 2555 medium term top is still in progress and should target 61 8 retracement of 1 0339 2017 low to 1 2555 at 1 1186 next sustained break there will pave the way to retest 1 0339 however break of 1 1814 will confirm completion of such down trend and turn medium term outlook

if growth is slowing globally china is facing a less friendly external environment in terms of being able to export a lot and if growth is slowing domestically as well then you may need to do more to stabilise growth than what has been done so far tilton said the risk is you are doing too little he said tilton said there is a danger that chinese policymakers could underestimate the size of the risk and not offer enough stimulus particularly as it looks to deal with sluggish demand in key export markets it will be increasingly tricky for beijing to calibrate the right dosage of stimulus to prevent a sharp economic slowdown this year tilton told an event in hong kong this week global growth concerns are complicating chinese policymakers efforts to stabilise its economy said andrew tilton chief asia pacific economist at goldman sachs as beijing embarked on a new round of stimulus on january 23 the ministry of finance said it will increase spending plan for large scale tax cuts and reduce social security fees paid by employers in a bid to shore up confidence in the economy which grew at 6 6 per cent last year the lowest pace for 28 years on the same day the people s bank of china pboc china s central bank injected 257 5 billion yuan us 37 9 billion into the banking system for the first time using its targeted medium term lending facility to increase loans to struggling firms loans from the new facility carry a lower interest rate than other pboc lending vehicles and banks can take three years to repay them beijing must however tread a fine line between easing fiscal and monetary policies further this year and avoiding the sort of flood like stimulus that was used to combat economic downturns in the past chinese officials have repeatedly warned against fuelling risky levels of debt via local government financing vehicles and in the property sector japanese lender mufg bank estimates that china s debt to gdp ratio is more than 300 per cent including debt that is unreported to official authorities so far beijing has refrained from broad based loosening of funds and has shied away from benchmark interest rate cuts but it had implemented a raft of other policy measures before wednesday s announcements these include four rounds of reserve requirement ratio cuts to boost lending along with tax breaks and infrastructure spend the challenge is complicated by a slowing world economy with the international monetary fund slashing its global growth forecast for 2019 from 3 7 per cent to 3 5 per cent a fundamental slowdown in the us economy is underway said jan hatzius chief economist at goldman sachs speaking at the same event despite the ongoing trade war the us remains china s biggest trading partner by some distance hatzius said that lower us equity prices are helping to tighten financial conditions and putting a squeeze on the us economy despite the trade war the us remains china s biggest trading partner by some distance photo afp measures of financial conditions typically factor in long term bond yields corporate borrowing rates currency fluctuations and share prices these are under stress largely due to the stock market slump hatzius said the dow jones industrial average a stock market index that tracks the value of 30 large publicly owned us companies has lost 24 per cent since its peak in october 2018 pushing it into bear market territory the s p 500 which tracks america s 500 biggest stocks is down 10 per cent from its peak last year the deflated stock market is emblematic of a wider slowdown in the us economy goldman s analysts said the bank recently cut its forecast for us economic growth for the first half of 2019 from 2 4 per cent to 2 0 per cent us growth will decelerate further to 1 8 per cent in the third and fourth quarters of this year goldman sachs predicted global growth concerns are complicating chinese policymakers efforts to stabilise its economy said andrew tilton chief asia pacific economist at goldman sachs as beijing embarked on a new round of stimulus photo bloomberg this compares unfavourably with the situation in the second quarter of 2018 when the economy grew by 4 2 per cent there are a number of risks to the growth outlook to global economic outlook hatzius said we will see continued significant drag on growth in the next couple of quarters from financial conditions even though recession risk in the us is relatively low facing down a multitude of domestic and external challenges beijing policymakers must decide on the right balance of stimulus but has been encouraged to abandon the old playbook of issuing more debt in favour of implementing structural reforms failure to do so will increase the risks of a hard landing said carl tannenbaum chief economist at northern trust a us investment house the time has come for china to move away from the ethereal economic model they have embraced during recent decades and accept one that is better grounded the trick in the process is to engineer an orderly descent tannenbaum said in a research note michael every senior asia pacific strategist at rabobank meanwhile warned of the complexity and systemic nature of the task facing beijing s policy wonks the party is facing long term and complex tests in terms of maintaining long term rule reform and opening up a market driven economy and within the external environment he wrote in a note the party is facing sharp and serious dangers of a slackness in spirit lack of ability distance from the people and being passive and corrupt this is

see forecast prices used in estimates net reserves are the company s working interest share after the deduction of royalties net reserves in egypt include the company s share of future cost recovery and production sharing oil after the government s royalty based interest but before reserves relating to income taxes payable under this method a portion of the reported reserves will increase as oil prices decrease and vice versa as the barrels necessary to achieve cost recovery change with prevailing oil prices possible reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves there is a 10 probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the sum of proved plus probable plus possible reserves 2018 reserve changes reserves at 2018 year end were lower compared to 2017 year end primarily due to the production of 5 3 mmboe which were substantially offset by 3 5 mmboe gross 2p reserves basis of net positive revisions the 3 5 mmboe of net positive revisions reflect additions from discoveries extensions and improved recovery of 3 9 mmboe in egypt 0 1 mmboe of infill drilling in canada which was offset by a 0 5 mmboe negative revision relating to minor asset performance in egypt and economic factors in canada egypt in egypt the company replaced 95 of 2018 production 4 4 mmbbl on a 1p gross reserves basis and 79 of 2018 production on a 2p gross reserves basis reserves additions from drilling came from a discovery well in south ghazalat reserves extensions from two wells in west bakr one well in nw gharib and the remaining additions coming from reserves category conversions positive reserves additions also resulted from improved recovery due to an artificial lift optimization program and technical revisions due to a recompletion program which was implemented following the west bakr phase 2 production facility expansions in 2018 the positive revisions highlighted above were partially offset by the underperformance of two minor fields in the west gharib concession canada in canada the company replaced 51 of 2018 production 0 8 mmboe on a 1p gross reserves basis and 98 of 2018 production on a 2p gross reserves basis the company drilled six gross five net cardium formation oil wells 5 one mile and 1 two mile horizontal wells completed with multi stage fracture stimulation in the harmattan area all of which represented undeveloped reserves conversions positive technical revisions resulted primarily from the 2017 drilling program outperforming forecasts allowing infill drilling reserves to be booked to this year s program the positive additions were slightly offset by the negative technical revisions associated with challenging economics for natural gas in the lone pine harmattan areas

additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves it is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the sum of the estimated

quantities recovered will equal or exceed the sum of the estimated proved probable possible reserves gross reserves are the company s working interest operating and non operating share before deduction of royalties and without including any royalty interests of the company net reserves are the company s working interest share after the deduction of royalties net reserves in egypt include the company s share of future cost recovery and production sharing oil after the government s royalty based interest but before reserves relating to income taxes payable under this method a portion of the reported reserves will increase as oil prices decrease and vice versa as the barrels necessary to achieve cost recovery change with prevailing oil prices developed reserves are those reserves that are expected to be recovered from existing wells and installed facilities or if facilities have not been installed that would involve a low expenditure e g when compared to the cost of drilling a well to put the reserves on production developed producing reserves are those reserves that are expected to be recovered from completion intervals open at the time of the estimate these reserves may be currently producing or if shut in they must have previously been on production and the date of resumption or production must be known with reasonable certainty developed non producing reserves are those reserves that either have not been on production or have previously been on production but are shut in and the date of resumption is unknown undeveloped reserves are those reserves expected to be recovered from known accumulations where a significant expenditure for example when compared to the cost of drilling a well is required to render them capable of production they must fully meet the

bullard gordin grouse kane berman majozi rw johnson straight talk singapore revisited wsm opinion china s loans to south africa iii charles collocott examines the experiences of zambia ethiopia and kenya china s loans to south africa brief iii the first brief was an overview of south africa s debt situation how the loans from china fit into this and why it is we need to look at the experiences other countries have had with chinese debt the second brief considered the experiences sri lanka pakistan and argentina have had with chinese debt the fourth brief summarises the lessons learned from these experiences the final brief looks at why the brics bank was not used on what basis government is able to refuse disclosing further information on the loans and finishes with a conclusion for the series zambia china s loans to zambia began the 1960s when the white minority rhodesian government cut off zambia s railway access for its copper to be transported to ports in south africa after failed attempts to secure funding from the west because of failed feasibility studies the zambian and tanzanian governments commissioned china to assist fund and build tazara a railway line from the copper belt in zambia to dar es salaam in tanzania at an initial cost of 570 million tazara was at the time the single biggest overseas loan ever by the chinese government the loan was interest free and not indexed to inflation due to the limited amount of foreign currency the chinese had available it was agreed that 75 of the 560m was to come from the sale of chinese goods in tanzania and zambia that is tanzania and zambia would import chinese goods and the proceeds from the sale of these goods would be put towards construction expenses additionally mainly chinese inputs and equipment would be used goods into the region from china rose from 0 9 of total imports in 1966 to 22 4 in 1970 the impact on the domestic manufacturers and economies of zambia and tanzania was disastrous and the terms of import had to be renegotiated during the 1980s and despite the earlier failed feasibility studies the european economic community several european states and the united states did an about turn and decided to get involved the western countries stated that this was to try and lessen the dependence of other southern african countries on apartheid south africa over the decade a cumulative 200 million in loans was extended to the parastatal tazara unfortunately has been a financial failure due to substandard equipment poor management fluctuations in the copper price and changes to the political economy with independence in namibia and the end of apartheid in south africa in the 90s as well the end of the civil wars in angola and mozambique zambian producers had more transport options available and traffic on the railway line decreased to only 690 000 tons in 2009 from several millions in the 1970s in an attempt to revitalise tazara china cancelled its debt in 2011 and because it was interest free and not linked to inflation the real value of the debt had in fact shrunk by over 80 then between 2010 and 2012 china extended an additional 81 million in interest free loans for equipment and training despite this and with no current debt figures publicly available in 2018 tazara s management highlighted the difficulties when reporting gross revenue at 21 32 million and running costs at 34 million in recent times further loans and expertise have been extended by the chinese to the zambian government for the construction of a power plant roads stadiums and industrial parks according to news reports the current extent of zambia s debt to china is not known with certainty and there have also been reports that zesco zambia s state owned power company has been used as security for the loans speaking at a recent seminar on africa chinese relations hosted by the university of johannesburg s confucius institute mr chaimbaphiri md of heron consulting which specialises in investment in zambia recalled having asked the zambian finance minister mrs margaret mwanakatwe about reports of zesco being used as security mrs mwanakatawe apparently told mr phiri that zesco was not used for this purpose and the loans were instead insured through sinosure a chinese state owned export and credit insurance company a routine search of news reports on the subject however reveals strong speculation within the media that zesco has been put forward as security economists have expressed concern around the lack of political will shown by the zambian government in managing its debt which was expected to rise to 60 of gdp by the end of 2018 compared to 25 6 in 2014 raising questions of government responsibility in borrowing and insufficient due diligence by lenders as of june this year zambia s external debt was close to a third of the total which would see an increase the risk of default if the zambian kwacha was to weaken in the press zambian officials dismiss the possibility of default simply by saying that zambia has never defaulted this however is misleading if one considers that less than a decade ago zambia had its debt to the world bank and imf written off kenya centered on transport infrastructure china has also provided extensive funding and expertise to kenya in recent times the largest of these projects has been the standard gauge railway line sgr from the port city of mombasa to western kenya initially sgr was to also reach uganda and rwanda but rwanda withdrew citing high costs and uganda withdrew due to security concerns opting instead for a tanzanian route in 2008 protestors in nairobi uprooted a section of the existing railway line and blocked roads thereby making it impossible for uganda to receive imports from kenya which crippled the economy when it comes to inputs for sgr reports have it that the kenyan government has negotiated better deals on behalf of kenyans when compared to other countries all cement for the sgr was supplied by kenyan businesses railway cars were made in kenya over 25 000 kenyans were employed and trained 33 crossing stations as well as bridges and tunnels were added to reduce the impact on wildlife and the national land commission doubled its budget for compensation however many of these measures still proved controversial particularly land value estimates working conditions for kenyan employees and the stretches of track in areas with high biodiversity and withcritics arguing that sgr has not resolved the corruption issues that made kenya s existing rail transport so inefficient one wonders how kenyan companies were prioritised with regards to supplying inputs so far and even before the extension to western kenya sgr has cost around 6 billion equal to a third of kenya s foreign debt it has been argued by dr w k shiloha author of sino kenyan co operation whither the west that sgr is not economically viable and a better option would have been to upgrade existing archaic railway lines according to dr shiloha this was not done because it would have encroached on the road transportation interests of politically connected individuals and their companies he also points out that sgr will not improve carrying capacity or reduce costs and will therefore not generate enough revenue to pay off the 4 billion spent for the line from mombasa to nairobi both the imf and world bank have raised warnings about kenya s increasing debt appetite stating that its repayment burden could affect growth the kenyan government has ignored these warnings and continued to borrow in 2018 debt surpassed 50 of gdp and over 40 of government revenue is required for debt repayment which is said to cancel out expected economic benefits from sgr and other infrastructure investments in 2018 chinese loans made up 11 of kenya s total debt ethiopia for the past decade or so ethiopia has been a prominent african investment destination particularly for china in line with ethiopia s strategic development policies 13 billion in loans from china have been directed towards transport infrastructure industrial parks and power plants this alongside a population of around 150 million labour costs lower than china or even vietnam and an investor friendly policy stance has seen ethiopia s gdp grow at an average rate of over 11 55 for the past 12 years ethiopia may be seen as a positive case where the borrower and lender countries have recalibrated after considering costs and benefits of further loans recently china began scaling back is investment in ethiopia citing risks around ethiopian foreign exchange shortages due to imports vastly outstripping exports for the last 5 years or so as well as high levels of government debt also speaking at the seminar on africa chinese relations hosted by the university of johannesburg prof messaymutulega while lauding the economic benefits the chinese loans amongst investments from other countries highlighted corruption as a major issue in ethiopia generally however a slew of recent arrests of government officials for corruption is a step in the right direction for the reformist prime minister abiy ahmed elected in april last year despite all the good news earlier this year the imf raised its rating of ethiopia s risk of debt distress to high and in a sign that the government is facing difficulties paying back some of its debt as originally agreed an announcement was made recently with regards to the restructuring of a 4 billion loan for the railway line between addis ababa to djibouti to be paid over 30 years instead of the initially agreed 10 going forward the financial viability of the railway may rely on the success or failure of djibouti s improved port and free trade zone both chinese funded at 590 million and 3 5 billion respectively ethiopia s debt to gdp ratio currently stands at just under 60 and due to the country having one of the fastest growing economies in the world some academics believe its debt levels will remain safe for at least the next few years to come assuming the 12 1 billion in loans extended in the last 10 years makes up the total chinese loans this would imply that ethiopia s debt to china is 26 1 of the country s debt charles collocott is a researcher at the helen suzman foundation footnotes yu donghai why the chinese sponsored the tazara an investigation about

bullard gordin grouse kane berman majozi rw johnson straight talk singapore revisited wsm opinion china s loans to south africa iii charles collocott examines the experiences of zambia ethiopia and kenya china s loans to south africa brief iii the first brief was an overview of south africa s debt situation how the loans from china fit into this and why it is we need to look at the experiences other countries have had with chinese debt the second brief considered the experiences sri lanka pakistan and argentina have had with chinese debt the fourth brief summarises the lessons learned from these experiences the final brief looks at why the brics bank was not used on what basis government is able to refuse disclosing further information on the loans and finishes with a conclusion for the series zambia china s loans to zambia began the 1960s when the white minority rhodesian government cut off zambia s railway access for its copper to be transported to ports in south africa after failed attempts to secure funding from the west because of failed feasibility studies the zambian and tanzanian governments commissioned china to assist fund and build tazara a railway line from the copper belt in zambia to dar es salaam in tanzania at an initial cost of 570 million tazara was at the time the single biggest overseas loan ever by the chinese government the loan was interest free and not indexed to inflation due to the limited amount of foreign currency the chinese had available it was agreed that 75 of the 560m was to come from the sale of chinese goods in tanzania and zambia that is tanzania and zambia would import chinese goods and the proceeds from the sale of these goods would be put towards construction expenses additionally mainly chinese inputs and equipment would be used goods into the region from china rose from 0 9 of total imports in 1966 to 22 4 in 1970 the impact on the domestic manufacturers and economies of zambia and tanzania was disastrous and the terms of import had to be renegotiated during the 1980s and despite the earlier failed feasibility studies the european economic community several european states and the united states did an about turn and decided to get involved the western countries stated that this was to try and lessen the dependence of other southern african countries on apartheid south africa over the decade a cumulative 200 million in loans was extended to the parastatal tazara unfortunately has been a financial failure due to substandard equipment poor management fluctuations in the copper price and changes to the political economy with independence in namibia and the end of apartheid in south africa in the 90s as well the end of the civil wars in angola and mozambique zambian producers had more transport options available and traffic on the railway line decreased to only 690 000 tons in 2009 from several millions in the 1970s in an attempt to revitalise tazara china cancelled its debt in 2011 and because it was interest free and not linked to inflation the real value of the debt had in fact shrunk by over 80 then between 2010 and 2012 china extended an additional 81 million in interest free loans for equipment and training despite this and with no current debt figures publicly available in 2018 tazara s management highlighted the difficulties when reporting gross revenue at 21 32 million and running costs at 34 million in recent times further loans and expertise have been extended by the chinese to the zambian government for the construction of a power plant roads stadiums and industrial parks according to news reports the current extent of zambia s debt to china is not known with certainty and there have also been reports that zesco zambia s state owned power company has been used as security for the loans speaking at a recent seminar on africa chinese relations hosted by the university of johannesburg s confucius institute mr chaimbaphiri md of heron consulting which specialises in investment in zambia recalled having asked the zambian finance minister mrs margaret mwanakatwe about reports of zesco being used as security mrs mwanakatawe apparently told mr phiri that zesco was not used for this purpose and the loans were instead insured through sinosure a chinese state owned export and credit insurance company a routine search of news reports on the subject however reveals strong speculation within the media that zesco has been put forward as security economists have expressed concern around the lack of political will shown by the zambian government in managing its debt which was expected to rise to 60 of gdp by the end of 2018 compared to 25 6 in 2014 raising questions of government responsibility in borrowing and insufficient due diligence by lenders as of june this year zambia s external debt was close to a third of the total which would see an increase the risk of default if the zambian kwacha was to weaken in the press zambian officials dismiss the possibility of default simply by saying that zambia has never defaulted this however is misleading if one considers that less than a decade ago zambia had its debt to the world bank and imf written off kenya centered on transport infrastructure china has also provided extensive funding and expertise to kenya in recent times the largest of these projects has been the standard gauge railway line sgr from the port city of mombasa to western kenya initially sgr was to also reach uganda and rwanda but rwanda withdrew citing high costs and uganda withdrew due to security concerns opting instead for a tanzanian route in 2008 protestors in nairobi uprooted a section of the existing railway line and blocked roads thereby making it impossible for uganda to receive imports from kenya which crippled the economy when it comes to inputs for sgr reports have it that the kenyan government has negotiated better deals on behalf of kenyans when compared to other countries all cement for the sgr was supplied by kenyan businesses railway cars were made in kenya over 25 000 kenyans were employed and trained 33 crossing stations as well as bridges and tunnels were added to reduce the impact on wildlife and the national land commission doubled its budget for compensation however many of these measures still proved controversial particularly land value estimates working conditions for kenyan employees and the stretches of track in areas with high biodiversity and withcritics arguing that sgr has not resolved the corruption issues that made kenya s existing rail transport so inefficient one wonders how kenyan companies were prioritised with regards to supplying inputs so far and even before the extension to western kenya sgr has cost around 6 billion equal to a third of kenya s foreign debt it has been argued by dr w k shiloha author of sino kenyan co operation whither the west that sgr is not economically viable and a better option would have been to upgrade existing archaic railway lines according to dr shiloha this was not done because it would have encroached on the road transportation interests of politically connected individuals and their companies he also points out that sgr will not improve carrying capacity or reduce costs and will therefore not generate enough revenue to pay off the 4 billion spent for the line from mombasa to nairobi both the imf and world bank have raised warnings about kenya s increasing debt appetite stating that its repayment burden could affect growth the kenyan government has ignored these warnings and continued to borrow in 2018 debt surpassed 50 of gdp and over 40 of government revenue is required for debt repayment which is said to cancel out expected economic benefits from sgr and other infrastructure investments in 2018 chinese loans made up 11 of kenya s total debt ethiopia for the past decade or so ethiopia has been a prominent african investment destination particularly for china in line with ethiopia s strategic development policies 13 billion in loans from china have been directed towards transport infrastructure industrial parks and power plants this alongside a population of around 150 million labour costs lower than china or even vietnam and an investor friendly policy stance has seen ethiopia s gdp grow at an average rate of over 11 55 for the past 12 years ethiopia may be seen as a positive case where the borrower and lender countries have recalibrated after considering costs and benefits of further loans recently china began scaling back is investment in ethiopia citing risks around ethiopian foreign exchange shortages due to imports vastly outstripping exports for the last 5 years or so as well as high levels of government debt also speaking at the seminar on africa chinese relations hosted by the university of johannesburg prof messaymutulega while lauding the economic benefits the chinese loans amongst investments from other countries highlighted corruption as a major issue in ethiopia generally however a slew of recent arrests of government officials for corruption is a step in the right direction for the reformist prime minister abiy ahmed elected in april last year despite all the good news earlier this year the imf raised its rating of ethiopia s risk of debt distress to high and in a sign that the government is facing difficulties paying back some of its debt as originally agreed an announcement was made recently with regards to the restructuring of a 4 billion loan for the railway line between addis ababa to djibouti to be paid over 30 years instead of the initially agreed 10 going forward the financial viability of the railway may rely on the success or failure of djibouti s improved port and free trade zone both chinese funded at 590 million and 3 5 billion respectively ethiopia s debt to gdp ratio currently stands at just under 60 and due to the country having one of the fastest growing economies in the world some academics believe its debt levels will remain safe for at least the next few years to come assuming the 12 1 billion in loans extended in the last 10 years makes up the total chinese loans this would imply that ethiopia s debt to china is 26 1 of the country s debt charles collocott is a researcher at the helen suzman foundation footnotes yu donghai why the chinese sponsored the tazara an investigation about

in 2018 hunton andrews kurth llp s structured finance and securitization team closed a number of substantial transactions developed novel structures for our clients and advised on important tax regulatory and other industry developments as a result of the merger of hunton williams and andrews kurth kenyon we have added structured finance lawyers in dallas and washington and our structured finance practice is working closely with our chambers band 1 ranked energy capital markets practice based in houston to expand our offerings to our structured finance and energy clients geographically and in response to growing demand from private equity and bank clients in the uk and europe we expanded our coverage to london with the additions of angus duncan and david klass to our partnership we appreciate the many opportunities to serve both our new and our returning clients and we look forward to continuing those important business relationships in the years ahead below is a summary of factors impacting our clients in 2019 as well as an overview of our team s activities in recent months table of contents forecast for 2019 1 highlights from 2018 7 thought leadership 10 publications 10 rankings and awards 11 new team members 12 key contacts 14 about us 15 forecast for 2019 reverse mortgage securitization 2018 proved to be a robust year for securitizations of fha insured home equity conversion mortgages hecms including the introduction of a new issuer in the market and several other issuances by more seasoned issuers we expect that the securitization of these assets will continue to flourish in 2019 as issuers look to leverage buyouts of nonperforming hecms from ginnie mae hmbs pools in addition to acquisitions of various portfolios from third parties we have been involved in every securitization of nonperforming hecms in the market and have assisted in innovations of structuring of these deals to allow for additional leverage of the collateral pool while minimizing any tax consequences the proprietary reverse mortgage market is also finally roaring back to life following a substantial decline from prerecession highs as participants in the proprietary reverse market expand on their product offerings and increase new origination volume we expect to see increased securitization activity for this asset class 2018 saw a number of performing and nonperforming proprietary jumbo reverse mortgage securitizations the recent deals in this space have demonstrated investor interest in bonds backed by proprietary reverse mortgages and we expect new originations to continue to accelerate with an uptick in securitizations to follow shortly thereafter credit risk transfer in 2019 we believe the gses will continue to build upon the structural innovations introduced in 2018 with respect to back end credit risk transfer deals which included a transition from direct debt deals to trust and remic structures we also expect the gses to continue to transfer risk through reinsurance and deep mortgage insurance arrangements with mortgage insurers in turn we expect that the new private mortgage insurer eligibility requirements pmiers 2 0 will incentivize mortgage insurers to continue their risk transfer structuring through mortgage insurancelinked note offerings most major mortgage insurance companies have now leveraged this form of risk transfer and several transitioned to more programmatic issuances of transferring risk for newly written policies residential mortgage backed securities while 2018 was a very good year for rmbs experiencing a large increase in issuance volume for newly originated and re performing mortgage loans compared to the previous year the forecast for 2019 is rather uncertain at this point market factors such as rising interest rates stock market gyrations and home price affordability issues will likely prevent 2019 issuance from exceeding that seen in 2018 however a strong job market and rising wages should be enough to stabilize and support the private label rmbs market also credit standards have continued to ease and we expect a continued thriving market for deals backed by nonqualified mortgage loans warehouse financing amid the steady increase of benchmark interest rates we have seen a continued push for consolidation among mortgage loan originators and servicers particularly those who operate in the increasingly competitive agency eligible mortgage loan space while this consolidation has narrowed the ranks of seller side participants in warehouse lending we expect to see some new entrants on the buyer side of the market as we turn to 2019 we anticipate that the trends witnessed in 2018 will continue and we are looking forward to assisting our clients to identify and take advantage of new opportunities in 2018 our warehouse lending practice experienced sustained growth in transactions involving agency eligible collateral nonperforming and re performing mortgage loans reo properties non qm mortgage loans traditional and small balance commercial loans short term investor mortgage loans residential tax liens cmbs and rmbs 1 structured finance and securitization 2018 year in review financings and reverse mortgage loans of particular note in 2018 the uptick in non qm mortgage loan deals that we have seen in the past couple of years continued and financings of fix and flip investor rental and other business purpose mortgage loans saw increased volume warehouse financing of early buyout loans from securitizations has also become an area of increased industry focus as servicers attempt to actively manage their delinquency ratios as anticipated we witnessed an increase in the use of creative structures by which repo buyers now provide financing for reo properties and mortgage servicing rights affording themselves the protection of the bankruptcy safe harbors so often used for whole mortgage loans another area where we have seen steady activity is in programmatic lenders re hypothecating the assets they are financing on repo these lenders have always had the contractual right to re hypothecate but many have held the assets on balance sheet in recent years recently more and more repo lenders are closing re hypothecations often documented as back to back repos as we continue to build on our industry leading role in representing programmatic lenders and major repo sellers in warehouse lending transactions across a variety of asset types we look forward to working with our clients to meet their needs in the evolving warehouse lending landscape regulatory cfpb developments during 2018 the cfpb and its regulatory initiatives faced numerous changes under the leadership of interim director mick mulvaney who sought to scale back cfpb actions and implemented requests for information regarding the regulation of a variety of consumer finance businesses including the fintech industry following mulvaney s leadership the senate confirmed kathy kraninger as the cfpb director on december 6 2018 within the first month of her appointment kraninger stated that the cfpb must vigorously enforce the law operate without presumption of guilt and carefully weigh the costs and benefits of its enforcement actions in order to provide for the best interest of consumers and the marketplace several commentators speculate that as director kraninger will take a middle of the road approach between the policies of her predecessors richard cordray and interim director mick mulvaney but her priorities for the bureau s agenda and initiatives remain to be seen a significant regulatory change in 2018 was the enactment of the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act which became effective in september 2018 the act raised the threshold of assets that subjects institutions to stress tests and subjects community banks to reporting requirements and further added identity theft protections consumer credit report security freezes and limitations on credit reporting relating to certain student loans and veteran medical debts in line with these new protections the cfpb has indicated that consumer reporting regulation specifically accuracy of reports and identity theft issues are a priority for long term action huntonak com 2 forecast for 2019 continued the cfpb also continued its regulatory focus on fair lending and student lending consistent with the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act s option for consumers to have certain student loan debt removed from their consumer report upon compliance with specific loan modification requirements the bureau also indicated priority for its renewed efforts to understand and encourage development particularly in the fintech market through the proposed revitalization of its no action letter nal policy and product sandbox initiative the current nal policy provides letters to approved applicants stating that upon compliance with specified terms the bureau will not bring an enforcement action related to the approved product the product sandbox initiative provides applicants approved new products with safe harbor from statutory and regulatory requirements including those of the truth in lending act the equal credit opportunity act and the electronic funds transfer act the proposed nal policy update seeks to reduce the burden on applicants by decreasing the wait time for approval and permitting letters to include no action for unfair deceptive and abusive acts and practices claims which are a substantial source of enforcement actions similarly the cfpb seeks to reduce the application burden and strengthen the protections provided through its product sandbox initiative additionally the bureau will begin its public disclosure this year of data collected under the home mortgage disclosure act hmda the bureau will limit the disclosures to the public by providing ranges of data on age and amounts of loans and excluding identifying information such as addresses and credit scores other upcoming areas of cfpb rulemaking include clarification of partial hmda exemptions created by the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act and reconsideration of its 2017 payday and vehicle title loan rule which has a compliance date in august 2019 single family rental the sfr market saw freddie mac announce its pilot program for sfr financing at the beginning of 2018 and before the end of 2018 announce that the federal housing finance agency fhfa had not renewed the pilot program we acted as a counsel to freddie mac in developing the pilot program and as counsel to freddie mac and the loan originator in many of the financings completed under the pilot program although we are sad to see the end of freddie mac s involvement on a regular program basis in the sfr market there appear to be significant sources of funds available at all levels of the sfr market during 2018 we saw a development of more warehouse lending arrangements to sfr sponsors that did not require mortgages as security typically these transactions involve springing mortgages nonmortgage warehouse lending provides cost effective financing for sfr sponsors as they acquire properties adjust their portfolios to meet their goals and then sell properties that do not meet their goals apparently the sfr market is performing well as we have seen new lenders entering the market as well as new sponsors entering the market in 2019 and established sponsors continuing to expand and diversify their portfolios we have been particularly active in advising clients in the sales acquisitions and financings of sfr property portfolios of various sizes as well as advising our reit clients as some of them enter this market we expect this market and these activities to remain healthy for 2019 servicing rights financing in 2018 we saw the continued evolution of the financing of and structuring investments in servicing rights and servicing cash flows especially with regard to fannie mae freddie mac and ginnie mae mortgage servicing servicers and their investment banks have been working for years to develop efficient ways to finance mortgage servicing portfolios fannie 3 structured finance and securitization 2018 year in review forecast for 2019 continued mae freddie mac and ginnie mae have been sensitive to the needs of their servicers to access greater liquidity balanced against the need for the agencies to retain control over the servicing of their mortgage loans and collateral investors largely fund investors and reits have become increasingly interested in financing mortgage servicing rights msrs and investing in excess servicing spread strips hunton andrews kurth brings together lawyers from our structured finance corporate secured lending private equity tax and bankruptcy teams to focus our combined experience on assisting our clients in developing innovative transactions for financing and investing in msrs excess spread related to msrs and working with the agencies to find realistic balancing of the market s need for efficient financing and the agencies need for control in 2018 we represented and advised numerous fund investors and reits on excess spread investments through private equity and lending structures and several servicers in connection with joint ventures to facilitate investments in servicing cash flows we represented lenders and borrowers on several loans secured by agency servicing rights and agency and private label pools of excess servicing spreads associated with msr portfolios we also represented lenders underwriters and issuers in several securitizations secured by ginnie mae fannie mae and private label msr portfolios highlights we closed multilender and bilateral secured term loans with and without delayed draw capacity in some instances coupled with financing for private equity and reit debt investors to produce a desirable return each with different features tailored to the respective lender groups we advised on synthetic transfers of servicing cash flows through joint venture structures to enable private equity investment in servicing cash flows while leaving the servicing performance and the related compensation with the operating servicing company we represented underwriters in connection with the structuring amending and financing of structured financing facilities backed by agency and privatelabel excess spread and msr collateral under which collateralized bonds were issued both revolving bank funded notes and term securities including representing investment banks in the creation of securitization structures for the financing of fannie mae msr collateral and we advised on the financing of investment interests in excess servicing spread investment vehicles we anticipate the further evolution of the msr and excess spread market in 2019 our multidisciplinary team is dedicated to remaining at the forefront of these market developments and we expect to facilitate more innovative solutions for our bank investor and servicer clients in the coming year msr sales and servicing we continue to see a lot of activity in agency msr transactions with transaction size ranging from small transactions of under 1 billion upb to very large transactions involving portfolios of 20 billion of upb and greater in a rising interest rate environment and decreasing origination volume msr investments provide a nice hedge given slower prepayment speeds which of course equates to more attractive pricing for the seller in addition to bulk transactions we are seeing buyers and sellers enter into a variety of co issue and flow msr purchase and sale arrangements there are a number of nuances that arise on msr transactions and contract terms can vary based on the agency involved the seasoning and performance of the portfolio and other factors private label msr sale activity is more episodic although we continue to see a few transactions every year particularly where sellers are getting out of the private label servicing business entirely or have decided to sell the msr economics but stay on as subservicer huntonak com 4 forecast for 2019 continued residential whole loan transactions with rising interest rates lower origination volumes and a decreasing inventory of nonperforming mortgage loans overall whole loan secondary market activity is on a downward trend in 2018 one of the larger banks continued its exit from the residential mortgage loan business resulting in some significant loan sales in addition cleanup call activity on older securitizations is resulting in the acquisition and subsequent resecuritization of seasoned loans fannie mae and freddie mac continue to be active in selling nonperforming and re performing mortgage loans also the number of participants involved in non qm lending continues to increase which has been a positive factor on new origination volumes fintech the fintech market continued to expand in 2018 including into commercial lending for 2019 we expect these trends to continue resulting in growth in loan volume a broader range of asset classes and continued interest from offshore nonfund investors however actions by state regulators such as colorado s true lender litigation against avant and marlette could challenge these trends or drive more platforms to seek the occ s limited fintech banking charter which has also been challenged by a number of state regulators we also anticipate that in 2019 an increasing number of traditional lenders will begin to partner with or acquire online lenders as a way to serve or acquire customers hunton andrews kurth s activities during 2018 in the fintech area included among other things representing online lenders and loan sellers in securitizations of various products advising online platforms on federal and state regulatory compliance and related matters

blockchain technology and smart contracts have shown their potential in a number of areas such as fintech retail consumer products insurance and energy and we expect those areas to continue to expand in 2019 we expect to see a significant increase in the offer and sale of security tokens and other tokenized assets notwithstanding blockchain s demonstrated advantages the technology also presents

banking and finance blockchain html recent tax law changes on structured finance securitization 2019 continues the assimilation into the market of the numerous changes to the laws governing federal income taxes including notably those implemented in the tax cuts and jobs act that revised the internal revenue code changes that may continue to reverberate in the market from the tax cuts and jobs act include the reduction in the home mortgage interest deduction threshold the elimination of the deduction for interest on home equity loans and a limitation on the deduction for state and local taxes for which there is some discussion of revision any or all of these could reduce home affordability and impact home prices nationally or in local markets thus impacting residential mortgage loan securitizations and structured finance transactions in addition certain provisions in the 5 structured finance and securitization 2018 year in review forecast for 2019 continued tax cuts and jobs act could impact the federal income tax treatment of certain securitization and structured finance securities both debt and equity including a provision that may require the acceleration of certain types of income for accrual taxpayers excluding market discount and limitations on certain interest deductions the general impact of these provisions and in many cases their application continues to be unclear while we have not seen and do not expect that these changes will have a significant impact on securitizations and structured finance transactions generally we cannot predict the exact scope or long term impact of the tax cuts and jobs act or any other tax law changes on the securitization and structured finance market generally or particular investors or issuers fix and flip loans after several years of growth and heightened activity the fix and flip bridge loan market is poised for a slowdown in the coming year this contraction mirrors the downturn in the general real estate housing market and reflects the combined headwinds of higher borrowing costs and low property inventories in many regions although property value increases have slowed across most major markets home values still remain historically elevated which increases acquisition costs competition from primary residential homebuyers and institutional sfr investors also makes finding suitable properties more difficult as inventory levels remain low in many markets in some cases borrowers and lenders have begun expanding into different and larger property classes such as horizontal land development or multifamily mixed use and commercial properties in other cases many borrowers have begun altering their property takeout strategies to incorporate an sfr component where refurbished and rehabilitated properties are rented for a period of time before the original loan is refinanced with a more traditional loan for equity takeout purposes 2018 saw a number of securitization transactions involving fix and flip loans but secondary market whole loan sales will most likely continue to be the preferred takeout option for originators and lenders commodities lending securitization as the result of

transactions more recently john closed a similar transaction for public company a mark their first offering was 100 million the securitization structure offers a revolving acquisition period of several years to accommodate the short term nature of these loans that pay off frequently loan losses in this asset are negligible and the abs investors are protected by a significant haircut of the loans to the value of the collateral and secondly to a further haircut by the retention of first risk by the originator fund finance we have seen increasing activity in the fund finance market as banks have been responding to increasing demands from funds for new capital and leverage the firm has acted for both banks and funds on facilities backed by recourse to fund assets as funds have

matthew s stadler executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you brian good morning everyone and thanks for joining us our remarks this morning will focus on our as adjusted results reconciliation of gaap to as adjusted results can be found on pages 19 and 20 of the earnings release or on slide 16 and 17 of the earnings presentation yesterday we reported earnings of 0 56 per share compared with 0 55 in the prior year s quarter and 0 64 sequentially revenue was 93 6 million for the quarter compared with 99 3 million in the prior year s quarter and 98 2 million sequentially the decrease in revenue from the third quarter was primarily attributable to lower average assets under management average assets under management were 57 6 billion compared with 62 billion in the prior year s quarter and 60 4 billion sequentially operating income was 34 5 million in the quarter compared with 41 2 million in the prior year s quarter and 39 4 million sequentially our operating margin decreased to 36 8 from 40 2 last quarter primarily due to higher compensation and benefits and g a when compared to revenue expenses increased less than 1 on a sequential basis primarily due to higher compensation and benefits in g a partially offset by lower distribution and service fees the compensation to revenue ratio for the fourth quarter was 36 85 which is higher than the guidance we previously provided of 33 75 the increase in the ratio is primarily due to lower than forecasted revenue combined with a crude severance costs for the year the compensation to revenue ratio was 34 51 the increase in g a was primarily due to higher professional fees travel and entertainment expenses and sponsored and hosted conferences we did not incur previously anticipated revenue sharing and sub ta fees on retirement accounts at one of our intermediaries the decrease in distribution and service fee expense was primarily due to the reversal of these accrued fees during the fourth quarter as well as decreased expenses associated with lower average assets under management in us open end funds our effective tax rate for the quarter was 25 25 consistent with our prior guidance page 15 of the earnings presentation displays our cash corporate investments in us treasuries and seed investments for the current and trailing four quarters our firm liquidity totaled 213 million compared with 291 million last quarter and stockholders equity was 223 million compared with 324 million at september 30th the amount of firm liquidity and stockholders equity as of december 31st reflects the payment of a special cash dividend in december of approximately 117 million or 2 50 per share over the past nine years we have paid 11 per share in special dividends we remain debt free assets under management totaled 54 8 billion at december 31st a decrease of 5 3 billion or 9 from september 30th the decrease was driven by market depreciation of 3 2 billion net outflows of 1 2 billion and distributions of 842 million subadvised portfolios in japan had net outflows of 304 million in the quarter compared with 314 million in the third quarter outflows decelerated in the fourth quarter when compared to august and september the two months immediately following the last distribution rate cut total distributions on these portfolios totaled 363 million compared with 433 million last quarter subadvised accounts excluding japan had net outflows of 185 million primarily from client rebalancing out of global real estate us real estate and global listed infrastructure portfolios advised accounts had net inflows of 300 million during the quarter primarily from inflows into preferred and global real estate portfolios partially offset by outflows from international real estate portfolios due to client rebalancing bob steers will provide an update on our institutional pipeline and new business activity open end funds had net outflows of 1 billion during the quarter as the market decline triggered tax loss selling and retail investor redemptions distributions which included the payment of year end capital gains totaled 351 million 251 million of which were reinvested looking ahead although we remain confident in our pipeline positioning and opportunities we recognize we are in a challenging revenue environment resulting from lower assets under management going into 2019 i will briefly discuss some of the steps we are taking to manage our expense base we believe that our current headcount which includes a number of strategic hires made over the past few years provides us with meaningful operating leverage so we are taking a deliberate and measured approach to new and replacement hires although we believe this approach will control headcount growth lower assets under management resulting from the fourth quarter market decline combined with the full year impact of 2018 new hires will result in an expected compensation to revenue ratio of approximately 35 75 in 2019 we are actively reviewing all controllable expenses and are committed to reducing our non client related costs we are focused on inter office travel application licenses market data services and professional fees among other items we believe these efforts will allow us to hold the line on overall costs if not reduce them as a result we project g a for 2019 will be in line with the 46 million we recorded in 2018 but with a downward bias and finally we expect that our effective tax rate will remain at 25 25 in 2019 now i d like to turn the call over to our president joe harvey who will provide commentary on our investment performance joseph harvey president and chief investment officer thank you matt and good morning everyone i m going to discuss our investment performance and then summarize our 2019 priorities for the investment department in the fourth quarter our asset classes with the exception of midstream energy and resource equities defended much better than the s p 500 which loss 13 5 the drawdowns in us and global reits were less they were half or less of the s p 500 s decline while global infrastructure experienced even greater resistance with the decline of just 19 of the s p 500 s drop preferred s return negative 3 7 which reflected widening credit spreads which more than offset the decline of treasury yields looking at our relative investment performance in the quarter 6 of our 10 core strategies outperform their benchmarks and for the full year 9 out of 10 core strategies outperformed keep in mind that beyond our core strategies we typically have several versions of portfolios across the spectrum of risk and return as well as portfolios that represent more targeted subsets of the core strategy for example within preferred s which is counted as a single core strategy we have seven composite track records managed by our preferred and fixed income group including low duration preferreds reit preferreds and contingent capital securities measured by aum 93 of our portfolios are outperforming on a one year basis 97 are outperforming over three years and 98 are outperforming over five years 83 of our aum are in open end funds that are rated four or five star by morningstar market activity in the fourth quarter indicates that we are late cycle and is likely a harbinger of the next phase in the markets over a year ago we believe the biggest investment risk would be the transition from quantitative easing to quantitative tightening in late 2018 the market clearly became focused on the potential for a policy mistake by the fed our view is that economic growth and corporate profits have likely peaked which together with the transition from quantitative tightening to from quantitative easing to quantitative tightening could result in a stretch of higher market volatility and lower negative returns historically in late stages of the economic cycle real assets have performed well relative to stocks looking at late cycle periods going back to 1973 commodities infrastructure resource equities and reits in that order have outperformed us stocks by meaningful margins looking at the current environment as growth and return expectations decline the income provided by our reit and infrastructure strategies represents a larger proportion of return potential and together with their relative earnings stability become more attractive factors for investors in addition we believe these strategies have less risk of multiple compression as growth slows and quantitative tightening takes hold turning to the performance of our asset classes we outperformed our benchmarks in all of our reit strategies for both the fourth quarter and the full year 2018 this includes stand alone regional strategies in the us asia and europe as well as our global and international portfolios real estate was the second best performing gig sector in the s p in the quarter lifting real estates rank for 2018 to 5 out of 11 sectors after lagging the market significantly in early 2018 in infrastructure we underperformed in the quarter in part due to our overweight midstream energy and outperformed by 160 basis points for the year the asset class defended well versus stocks in part due to the utilities component of the strategy adding analyst to our infrastructure and midstream teams was a priority in 2018 and we are pleased with the calibre of new additions and our overall team size at this point we are well positioned to compete for what continues to be an active market for institutional searches and infrastructure midstream energy which was down 17 in the quarter was driven by falling oil prices and rising credit spreads tax loss selling was the factor driving many markets lower late in 2018 and it hit the midstream sector disproportionately we were surprised that midstream did not defend better because it had already undergoing a fundamental down cycle and now has accelerating fundamentals attract evaluations and yield support we underperformed in the quarter but overall had a strong year with 310 basis points of outperformance midstream shares have had a nice bounce so far in 2019 providing some resurgence in our fundamental view resource equities decline 17 on slowing economic expectations trade wars and oil price declines we outperformed in the quarter and by a 140 basis points for the year our real assets allocation team believes resource equities are statistically cheap our multi strategy real assets portfolio was down 7 for the quarter showing its diversification potential versus stocks and reflecting strong relative performance of the dispensive sectors of real estate infrastructure and high grade credit we underperformed slightly against our benchmark in the quarter but we re in line for 2018 in preferreds we outperformed for the full year albeit by a smaller margin than usual looking at our full range of strategies and preferreds and in fixed income we outperformed in six out of seven strategies for both the quarter and year considering the treasury yields may have peaked and the credit spreads have widen to more normal and supportive levels our team is more confident that our core preferred strategy will deliver at least its current yield of 6 this year if not a bit more in total return in 2018 our best performing strategy was european real estate which outperformed by 770 basis points our european real estate open end users fund is rated five stars our worst performing strategy was commodities which underperformed by 260 basis points as we have discussed on prior calls our protocol when we underperform is to activate performance remediation and improvement plans in the case of commodities we have responded by integrating quantitative techniques into our fundamental process and the initial results are promising i ll conclude my discussion today with an overview of our investment department priorities across all teams we continue to manage and prepare for the late stage environment and as a result have more balance in our portfolios i believe it is critical for active managers to outperform in the next down cycle left the industry lose more market share to index strategies while our outperformance statistics are strong we always have strategies that can do better and as mentioned commodities are our focus another goal is to deliver greater alpha from asset allocation considering that we are seeing more demand for multi strategy portfolios our three year old alpha mining project provides the foundation for performance enhancement and this year as a component of alpha mining we will dedicate resources in conjunction with our it department to quantitative techniques and data sources to complement our fundamental processes in terms of innovation we are excited by the opportunity to develop strategies for the endowment family office and ria markets these investors require strategies that are unique by virtue of having higher concentration being more targeted or having unique income or volatility profiles examples include are concentrated portfolios in real estate and midstream energy small cap infrastructure hedged real estate and an opportunistic real estate strategy we have seeded five track record accounts in these areas over the past year and are developing lp and other structures as we engage with prospective investors allocating firm resources to those areas were active management is in demand and appreciate it will provide growth for our firm as well as career paths and creative outlets for our investment professionals finally we will continue to optimize our use of external research and manage toward lowering these costs we have made meaningful progress on this front over the past two years spurred by method regulations and market practices in europe and we will transition to the last phase of this initiative as the sec evaluates commission versus hard dollar arrangements in the united states in summary our investment department is well positioned for 2019 i will now turn the call over to bob steers robert h steers chief executive officer thank you joe and good morning everyone as we all know by now last quarter and especially december saw capital markets and asset flows that were volatile complex and influenced by tax considerations these conditions induced investors across the spectrum to initiate risk reduction tax loss and rebalancing strategies with the end result in high levels of money in motion this market reaction also compressed and illuminated both the cyclical and secular challenges facing the active management industry although we were not immune from these market conditions we remain well positioned and confident that market conditions notwithstanding we will generate positive organic growth this year as reported we experienced net outflows of 1 2 billion in the quarter the overwhelming majority of which was derived from our open end funds it s our belief that the retail outflows were predominantly a year end phenomenon which will be at least partially reversed in the first quarter consistent with the trends in recent quarters the institutional advisory segment enjoyed robust investor demand and continued positive net flows but our subadvisory flows in the aggregate remain challenged in the quarter specifically with respect to the wealth channel tax loss selling and concerned regarding the widening of yield spreads had a major impact on our preferred securities open end fund flows in the quarter in total our open end funds had 1 billion of net outflows with the two preferred security funds accounting for virtually all of that amount flows into our real estate and infrastructure funds were essentially flat however our industry leading midstream energy fund buck the sector trends and delivered 42 million of net inflows our optimism regarding the wealth channels returned positive flows this quarter and year is grounded in a number of relevant fundamental factors first we expect a not insignificant portion of the tax loss motivated redemptions out of our preferred securities funds to return secondly consistent alpha generation across the range of our real asset and alternative income strategies has resulted in seven of our funds being added to 23 recommended list across 11 distribution partners during 2018 and importantly that positive trend has continued into this year third given the recent market and economic backdrop defensive dividend paying equity strategies have been upgraded and recommended by some of our biggest distribution partners although it s early flows this thus far this month are validating these expectations similar to the wealth channel advisory flows were also elevated in the quarter but ended with 300 million of net inflows as you may recall we began the fourth quarter with a 1 175 million pipeline of awarded but unfunded mandate during the quarter 255 million of that pipeline backlog was funded in addition to that amount 545 million of new mandates mainly in global real estate and multi strat real assets were both awarded and funded in the quarter for an aggregate realized funding of 800 million in total we won 785 million of new mandates leaving the end of quarter unfunded pipeline at approximately 1 billion beyond the existing pipeline we are awaiting the outcome of a record 2 5 billion plus of undecided finals current client net outflows totaled 495 million of which 133 million were terminations with the remainder attributable to rebalancing or withdrawals for other purposes anecdotally institutional investors who have historically invested in real assets privately by now inquiring and or allocating to listed strategies it appears to us that the private market expected irrs have declined sufficiently to make listed a more competitive risk adjusted investment option in addition concerns regarding heightened volatility and slowing global growth rates are motivating institutional investors to favor more liquid alternative investments in any event search activities remain elevated globally there were several significant developments in the subadvisory ex japan channel in addition to the net outflows of 185 million which reflect an evolution in that market and in our assessment and approach to this distribution channel fee pressures in combination with an absence of control over sales or marketing strategies make certain relationships that are not strategic in nature less attractive relative to our proprietary business development opportunities in europe as you know we are actively growing our own fund and distribution capabilities aimed at the wealth channel which has created a conflict over exclusivity with a current global real estate subadvisory client given the choice between delegating our emea wealth business to a third party or further developing our own we have elected to decline to grant exclusivity and to agree to terminate this relationship total aum managed for this client is approximately 800 million and we anticipate the transition to occur later this year it s our hope and expectation that in due course we will generate sufficient sales in our own funds to replace these assets with competitive fees and greater control of our brand separately as expected the balance of our 425 million large cap value subadvisory mandate has been terminated which constitutes the remainder of our large cap value subadvisory aum partially offsetting these future outflows is an expected 320 million inflow into global real estate from a long term and strategic subadvisory client which is also included in our pipeline japanese subadvisory net outflows showed improvement both before and after distributions versus the third quarter but remained elevated at 304 million and 667 million respectively with reits recently generating strong absolute and relative returns and with last year s top selling funds mainly technology focused now out of favor there appears to be an opportunity to regain investor interest this year is off to a good start with positive net inflows into our us reit funds thus far in january in contrast to the well documented headwinds facing long only managers which were highly visible last quarter we are as optimistic as ever for this coming year from a tactical standpoint our real asset and alternative income track records are strong across the board retail allocations to these strategies are rising and we are on more recommended and focus list than ever before institutionally hereto our performance solidifies a leadership position in our liquid alternative strategies at a point in the economic and capital market cycles when allocations to our space arising and listed appears to be as or more attractive than the private market alternatives strategically we continue to shift and migrate products and personnel toward markets that understand and appreciate our value proposition over the last three years institutional advisory assets under management have grown from 7 6 billion to 12 1 billion while subadvisory assets have declined from 18 5 billion to 12 5 billion inclusive of today s disclosures within the wealth channel assets under management derived from the rapidly growing independent ria channel now stand at 7 billion and growing which now exceeds our broker dealer assets under management of 6 billion not coincidentally our average fee rate during this three year period has risen from 54 2 basis points to 57 9 basis points to support and accelerate these trends this year we will be offering as joe mentioned a new series of focused and thematic strategies that will be unique and targeted at the endowment foundation ocio ria single and multi family office markets we are confident that we can grow assets in those markets that value performance and diversification along with competitive fees this initiative in conjunction with our existing business development activity will enhance our ability to generate positive and profitable organic growth for the foreseeable future with that i ll hand the call back to the operator and open the floor to questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from ari ghosh of credit suisse please go ahead ari ghosh credit suisse analyst hey good morning everyone brian heller senior vice president and corporate counsel good morning ari ghosh credit suisse analyst matt maybe you can take the first one just on the 2019 comp ratio of 35 75 that you mentioned is that projection based on 4q aum levels are you baking in any market improvement that we ve seen over the last three weeks and then just to confirm like the starting point that you mentioned for g a was 46 million and you expect that to remain flattish for full year 2019 all else equal matthew s stadler executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so with the comp ratio i mean you know we do our own internal forecasts but you know we are starting off at our year end aum levels and you know we re making assumptions like you guys do on flows and markets and although we are going to have a very tight control on headcount you know there s always going to be one or two that need to be added for strategic and important data gathering reasons so our comp ratio is based on that obviously it s you know january 24th so very early on it s our best guess of where we are at the moment and you know as the year unfolds you know we ll react accordingly but we feel good with that number just based on the 54 billion you know of where we re starting the g a in my points i ve cited the non gaap g a for the year because there s sometimes little confusion since we don t provide a non gaap income statement but yes we expect g a to be flat to 2018 but with a downward bias so but although we don t have a quantified numbers we re extremely busy looking at all of our expense base and would be disappointed honestly if we round up flat to 2018 robert h steers chief executive officer if i could just add maybe a little color starting the year with assets that were so depressed and with negative momentum in the marketplace i think our philosophy whether it s considering the inputs to a comp ratio or our approach to managing controllable expenses has been to plan for the worst and hope for the best so i would say that our approach to cost management our approach to assessing or projecting net flows or market are very conservative ari ghosh credit suisse analyst got it that s helpful and then just if you could provide any color on retail trends maybe that you seen early in 2019 especially in your preferred funds and then on the 2 5 billion of mandates and consideration that you called out are these from new client relationships existing clients is it lumpy nature and any you know if you could provide some information on that that d be great as well thank you robert h steers chief executive officer sure the we ve had positive flows into virtually all of our open end funds and so far this quarter by a wide margin the greatest inflows are into our preferred securities fund and so as we anticipated ending the quarter and beginning the year i think we re seeing a combination of some of the tax law selling coming back but frankly new investors excited about the investment opportunity there but we re seeing a solid flows into real estate funds as well so so far so good the pipeline or the 2 5 plus billion that we re waiting to hear from represents all new clients it s a little lumpy in that as i mentioned in my comments what we re seeing is a quite a number of very large institutions both domestically and outside the united states who have heretofore invested in real assets almost exclusively through private investing are pursuing the public markets now for the reasons i mentioned and so i think the 2 5 billion is a minimum there s others in the pipeline that haven t got into the finals stage yet so it s not just one or two but it is large and a little bit lumpy ari ghosh credit suisse analyst very helpful thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of john dunn evercore isi please go ahead john dunn evercore isi analyst good morning you guys had gross sales go up yeah i think in the four major categories up 33 i think quarter over quarter so you guys are selling a lot of stuff can you talk about that side of net flows maybe where that aggregate number could go and maybe what a little bit environment in 2019 would mean for it matthew s stadler executive vice president and chief financial officer it s hard to really get a trend of your gross inflows and outflows i think it s encouraging that in the open end funds we saw a large increase in our inflows showing that there is interest in our in lot of our real estate funds that we re where we were seeing the inflows occur you know the outflows were distorted as we mentioned because of the client redemptions and tax law selling but yeah we re encouraged by that trend i mean i think we re looking to have lower outflows and maybe sustain the trajectory and the inflows and that s where we re kind of optimistic in the wealth channel for 2019 robert h steers chief executive officer hey john as we talked about as you know the fourth quarter and particularly december was pretty wild and woolly the volatility was extreme and so it triggered all sorts of strategies tax losses being kind of the most obvious but there were plenty of others so i think it s hard to extrapolate too much from there i think it s more instructive to focus on the fundamental factors that i refer to so one you know top quartile top decile funds are selling anything lower than that is not asset allocations to defensive dividend paying uncorrelated asset classes like ours are rising they re both in the wealth channel which is i think you re seeing shifts away from high risk on call it technology and related strategies to more defensive strategies that accrues to our benefit in real estate infrastructure prefers as well and the trends we re saying institutionally so you know we re you know it s only been three weeks but with the exception of subadvisory we have solid positive flows in every channel i d like to extrapolate the rest of the year from that but so far so good john dunn evercore isi analyst got it and then little more in japan and it looks to us like flows have improved in january and if that holds it would be quicker than other recovery periods in the last couple distribution cut cycles are you guys see in that and is inaudible would doing anything different this time around robert h steers chief executive officer you know there s a number of i think positive fundamental issues or developments one is and some of you have inquired the regulatory pressure which began two or three years ago on these monthly higher dividend paying funds appears to have waned and is no longer it s no longer depressing marketing activity to the top selling funds of last year were funds like robotics and ai and you know what i would call more speculative funds and they had a very poor end of year those funds are not selling any longer the need for income continues to be extreme and unabated in japan and so and i would also add that one of the two us reit funds the larger of the two has actually been in positive flows for several months now so i think the time between the last cuts and now has helped the regulatory pressure dissipating perhaps gone completely now and the again not unlike domestically a shift in investor appetite more toward dividend paying defensive strategies i would also point out as joe show alluded to we were the number one performing reit fund in japan last year ahead of you know a fairly large group of decent competitors john dunn evercore isi analyst got you thanks very much guys operator thank you our next question comes from michael carrier of bank of america please go ahead michael carrier bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks guys matt maybe first one just for you just on the expenses you know you mentioned forecasting it you know based on your outlook and obviously the tougher start with the december follow because as we think about going through the year maybe just update us on how you think about what portion is variable in case the revenue environment gets a little bit tougher and i think you had some severance in the quarter i just wanted to make sure we had the right amount just so we re thinking about adjusting that out matthew s stadler executive vice president and chief financial officer yes on the comp side so and we said that the variation from the third to fourth quarter was primarily severance it was about 0 025 if you re just thinking about getting a better run rate our ratio of controllable to non controllable is about 30 being controllable that said even in the non controllable expenses as we had done a few years back there s always opportunity with vendors with number of users of a system and things of that nature so you know we re looking at everything that s why i say that at worse we would expect it to be flat to 2018 but we would be disappointed if we weren t able to achieve some sales year over year michael carrier bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay thanks and then maybe one for joe or bob so you see when i look at in all your comments you re helpful in terms of the outlook but when you know you kind of look at the outlook you have kind of the hardest thing i mean you have the performance with a lot bad manners and it s a challenge so when you look at what you re hearing from some of the clients both the wins and some of the either the reallocation or the redemptions as some of the headwinds been you know more from like a cyclical standpoint and maybe that is shifting as bob you mentioned has there been you know new product competition that s been coming in you know into some of the categories or is it just been changes you know in some of the distribution dynamics i mean where you re strong you know versus maybe where you know you have more kind of penetration or work to do i m just trying to get a sense you know in some of the drivers because obviously the performance is there i mean it sounds like your tone on the outlook is more favorable robert h steers chief executive officer mike it sounds like your question is focused mainly on retail is that right michael carrier bank of america merrill lynch analyst yeah i think yeah probably mostly on the retail side because on the institutional side you gave a lot of you know lot of color robert h steers chief executive officer sure well look it s no secret on the retail side we compete with passive ats consistently and we re one of the few managers that is a net inflows in the active long only reit space for example and passive continues to compete well we see some other products we have some private equity firms that are have been in the market with non traded real estate products and you know historically the competition is mainly because we re competing against the brand name historically those products do not perform well so over a full cycle we end up getting those assets back but you know it is more competitive that said i think what s in our favor is as you know your firm and others are narrowing their list of managers and in particular much much greater emphasis on recommended and even more important focus lists and look we re the category killer we re on the recommended list we re on focus list and so in many ways we have many fewer competitors the generic reit or infrastructure or even mlp mutual fund which is a two three or even four stars is not on the focus list and so our partners actually helped to elevate our performance and really provide a much stronger platform for us to continue to gain market share and i would point out we continue to gain market share in the retail channel and virtually every strategy that we manage versus active manager so to me the winners are those that can deliver that kind of performance and passive and the losers are the active managers who cannot deliver five star performance joseph harvey president and chief investment officer i just had from a market appetite perspective from asset allocation perspective looking back backward for the past two years a lot of our strategies have been seeing headwinds from the perspective of rising interest rates whether it s reit strategies or preferred strategies midstream energy not so much it s the issues there have been more the fundamental cycle but you know when you think about the comments i made on how the macro economic environment is turning and if we are in fact seeing a peeking process in the bond yields that headwind could turn to tailwinds bob mentioned that we ve seen several strategies may put by recommendations on defensive equity strategies that have high income components and earnings profiles that are more stable and so it could be that if we get this if the macro plays out as we suspect you know we could have some of those headwinds turn into tailwinds or maybe two neutral winds robert h steers chief executive officer mike if i could also just add a little color on the institutional side so whereas some of those private equity firms are trying to raise retail assets as joe and i outlined and in consistent with our goal to be able to generate both positive net organic growth and rising fees not declining fees we are introducing early this year some strategies that are not in 40 act wrappers that are going to be marketed to some of the same whether its family offices ocios and the endowment foundation markets that you know here the four have been mainly dominated by private equity firms and so you know we think those investors have the deep knowledge of the value of an asset allocation to real assets and alternative income strategies they like highly concentrated focused thematic limited capacity strategies and obviously we re not competing with passive fees in those channels so we re very excited about this initiative michael carrier bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay thanks a lot operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from mac sykes of g research please go ahead mac sykes g research analyst good morning everyone matthew s stadler executive vice president and chief financial officer hi mac robert h steers chief executive officer hi mac mac sykes g research analyst bob you outlined some moving parts in europe but i just want to make sure i have this right it sounds like the fee rates will benefit from a future product mix so as we move wealth and away from subadvisory there at the moment so when i think about that accurate contribution will that be additive to the overall fee rate robert h steers chief executive officer yeah i think the combination of lower fee business sort of being flat and higher fee business showing the greatest organic growth you know that is what we hope will be the engine that will keep our fee rates certainly from declining if not possibly even migrating a little bit higher mac sykes g research analyst okay and then could you just comment a little more on fundraising europe in general just given some of the noise around the brexit assuming we do get some clarity on those politics in the next couple months could that be a catalyst for an acceleration in your progress there robert h steers chief executive officer you know that s a tough question institutionally we re not you know we re seeing strong investor interest there s been no diminution of accelerating demand on the institutional side the wealth side as we ve talked about previously is coming along more slowly than we originally expected but it is coming along and part of that issue is there are some significant institutions that are not going to recommend or focus on our funds until they get to a critical mass of 200 million to 300 million which we expect to achieve in our key funds this year but i don t think we ve really seen any impact from brexit other than our own contingency planning there mac sykes g research analyst okay and then my last just two questions two parter the new series funds that you ve outlined are they being launched with seeded track records and then how are you thinking about the margins in that business versus the overall business robert h steers chief executive officer well there s a wide range of approaches to those strategies there are several strategies that are now very much in demand our concentrated strategies in global and us real estate that have 15 and 20 year track records and for one of those we re looking at an lt structure when we launch a new fund we typically need to put in some capital there are other strategies where we ve just newly developed them and we don t have long track records but for the target markets that we talked about we don t think you necessarily have to have a track record especially if you are managing a spinoff strategy or an extension of the things that we re well known for but we ll have a variety of approaches there will be some vehicles involved others will be offered as separate accounts in terms of the question of the profitability we believe we can get attractive fees relative to our current fees one of the issues however is that these investors like strategies that are unique and sometimes have limited capacity so we may not be able to achieve the scale that in some of these strategies that we have historically with broader mainstream strategies mac sykes g research analyst great thank you very much robert h steers chief executive officer if i just could add quickly to that what those strategies also do is frequently when we offer unique strategies like that we end up managing two three four additional strategies with the same client so even though a strategy may be capacity constrained oftentimes we end up adding assets in related strategies global real estate infrastructure and so forth operator thank you our next question comes from robert lee kbw please go ahead robert lee kbw analyst great thank you thanks for taking my questions most of them have been answered but just a couple of minor things maybe but you had mentioned that in distribution services expenses in the quarter benefited from some prior reversals can you maybe just kind of size that for us so we can get a sense of kind of what the run rate is and then maybe a follow on on the expense side i m assuming that q1 will have some there s normally some seasonal upward pressure in comp just as you pay fica taxes and things like that matthew s stadler executive vice president and chief financial officer right so thanks rob we with respect to the frictional costs on the payment of the bonuses and everything we actually accrue those during 2018 so the comp ratio that we had mentioned would be a good comp ratio to use for the first quarter inclusive of paying out the bonuses which all those costs had been previously accrued so nothing unique for us there on the distribution i would say if you want to size it up it s about it s between 400 000 and 500 000 a quarter it was one of our larger intermediaries that had indicated toward the end of 2017 that they would be initiating rev share on certain retirement assets that we have with them and they didn t bill us and so whether or not it s going to get resurrected in 2019 is unclear but we closed 2018 with a provision that we didn t need so we reversed it robert lee kbw analyst okay great and then maybe just a follow up question on any advisory i mean could you maybe and i apologize if you mentioned this early on but give us a sense of some of the geographic breakdown of where you re having the most success there and maybe give us update us again on your view of what s maybe driving that on the geographic basis robert h steers chief executive officer well we re seeing demand mainly from north america europe and the middle east we re not there s very little of that of the pipeline or the pipeline we re waiting to hear about very little of that is from asia so it s really north america europe the middle east and i think what s driving it is the factors that joe and i touched on already importantly i think a significant part of that is sort of a multi strat opportunities that we re seeing and we re seeing it from public funds we re seeing it from middle eastern entities we re seeing endowments who are interested in not one of our strategies but three to five of our strategies and some of the larger pools are interested in essence outsourcing their listed real estate or infrastructure allocation to a single provider and so you know it s really not to dissimilar from wealth where again you re seeing the intermediaries saying we re going to identify the two or three top decile top quartile managers and everyone else is going to not have shelf space and i think you re seeing the same thing institutionally where large institutions are looking to establish strategic relationships with people with firms that dominate their asset classes and they re handing over a wide swath of their portfolios albeit they have greater feed negotiating positions but these are great relationships because they re large and they re very long term they re strategic and that s the key to our thinking today is whether subadvisory or elsewhere we re focused on developing strategic relationships not just any robert lee kbw analyst and maybe as a follow up to the advisory channel just curious if you re seeing any increased interest or maybe demand from some institutional accounts to put in place some type of performance fee structure maybe a lower ongoing management fee and then having some kind of performance fee on top of that is are you seeing any of that robert h steers chief executive officer it depends on the strategy yes we re seeing some of that and but again i think there is historically in our experience there s been two approaches that we ve seen clients with respect to performance fees one is a somewhat cynical approach of just cutting fees so that if you deliver massive alpha you can get back to your base fee and as you would expect your ability to negotiate fees that are fair for both parties is a function of how strong your performance is how unique your strategies are and i think that s why if you re in core style boxes you have no choice but to acquiesce whereas the types of strategies that joe outlined nobody else is doing and very few can do so it s the that s one of the reasons that we like the new areas and markets that we re focusing on but yes for the large cap more generic strategies there are clients who are interested in having that discussion robert lee kbw analyst great thanks for taking my questions operator thank you there are no further questions at this time i will turn the call to chief executive officer bob steers for closing remarks please go ahead sir robert h steers chief executive officer great well thank you all for calling in this morning and we look forward to speaking to you after the first quarter thank

on the same day that the imf warned of the risk of another china induced sell off the publication of official gross domestic product data for the final quarter of last year showed that china s economy expanded at its weakest pace since 2009 dragging down the growth rate for the whole of 2018 to the lowest since 1990 the imf expects the economy to slow more sharply in the coming years decelerating to 6 2 per cent in 2019 and 2020 one of the dangers highlighted by the imf is the possibility of a deeper than envisaged slowdown in china which could lead to a repeat of the turmoil in 2015 16 when fears about the world s second largest economy caused abrupt wide reaching sell offs in financial and commodity markets that place its trading partners commodity exporters and other emerging markets under pressure what a difference a year makes at the start of last year s world economic forum in davos switzerland the international monetary fund hailed what it called the broadest synchronised global growth upsurge since 2010 yet this year s outlook which the imf presented on monday is decidedly downbeat warning of softening momentum and high uncertainty in the global economy stemming from a plethora of risks ranging from the trade war to the threat of a sharper deterioration in market sentiment while investors have become more sensitive to slowing growth over the past several months china s economic woes have not prevented a rally in emerging markets from gaining traction since the end of october the benchmark msci emerging market index the main gauge of stocks in developing economies has risen more than 8 per cent with the bulk of the gains occurring this year investors have also been pouring money into emerging market debt and equity funds which suffered a long spell of outflows last year what is more dollar denominated bond sales in developing nations are enjoying their third best start to the year on record according to dealogic a data provider to be sure a confluence of factors has increased the attractiveness of emerging market assets the most important one is the dovish tilt in us monetary policy in response to concerns about the spillover effects of the slowdown in china and the euro zone on the us economy over the past month the odds of another interest rate increase by the federal reserve this year have fallen to nearly zero contributing to declines in the dollar and us treasury yields which are relieving some of the pressure on developing countries another reason for the growing appeal of emerging markets is significantly cheaper valuations the nearly 20 per cent fall in the msci emerging market index from its peak last january has helped push down the gauge s forward price to earnings ratio a popular valuation tool to 11 its lowest level since the 2015 16 china led sell off investors monitor stock prices at a securities company in shanghai in september 2018 the msci emerging market index has risen more than 8 per cent since october with most of the gains occurring this year photo afp yet the underpinnings of the rally are fragile and suspect given the tensions between washington and beijing in their recent trade negotiations and the growing influence of china in determining market sentiment as i argued previously it is troubling that many investors have turned bullish on emerging markets despite the continued slowdown in china which accounts for one third of global growth and 30 per cent of the market capitalisation of the msci emerging market index while investors are banking on more aggressive stimulus measures if china s economy continues to deteriorate and the trade talks fail to produce a breakthrough acute tensions between the government s deleveraging drive and its efforts to rekindle growth are sufficient reason for caution while asia s economies which have the strongest trade and financial linkages with china are particularly vulnerable eastern europe is also at risk given the region s strong dependence on germany s export driven economy which narrowly averted a recession in the second half of last year partly because of weak demand in china still china vies with the fed in shaping sentiment towards emerging markets the us central bank s willingness to pause raising interest rates is fuelling a rally in so called risk assets benefiting developing economies yet investors could also be underestimating risks in us monetary policy america s economy is still quite buoyant providing scope for the fed to keep tightening policy by unwinding its balance sheet and possibly raising rates again if growth holds up however it is china not the united states that is at the epicentre of the global slowdown the imf s warnings about the world s second largest economy should not go unheeded nicholas spiro is a partner at lauressa advisory this article appeared in the south china morning post print edition as china slowdown casts shadow over emerging markets rally

and other sec filings we assume no duty to update any forward looking statement also our presentation contains non gaap financial measures that we believe are meaningful and evaluating our performance these non gaap financial measures should be read in conjunction with our gaap results a reconciliation of these non gaap financial measures is included in the earnings release and presentation the earnings release and presentation as well as links to our sec filings are available in the investor relations section of our website at www cohenandsteers com with that i ll turn the call over to matt matthew s stadler executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you brian good morning everyone and thanks for joining us our remarks this morning will focus on our as adjusted results reconciliation of gaap to as adjusted results can be found on pages 19 and 20 of the earnings release or on slide 16 and 17 of the earnings presentation yesterday we reported earnings of 0 56 per share compared with 0 55 in the prior year s quarter and 0 64 sequentially revenue was 93 6 million for the quarter compared with 99 3 million in the prior year s quarter and 98 2 million sequentially the decrease in revenue from the third quarter was primarily attributable to lower average assets under management average assets under management were 57 6 billion compared with 62 billion in the prior year s quarter and 60 4 billion sequentially operating income was 34 5 million in the quarter compared with 41 2 million in the prior year s quarter and 39 4 million sequentially our operating margin decreased to 36 8 from 40 2 last quarter primarily due to higher compensation and benefits and g a when compared to revenue expenses increased less than 1 on a sequential basis primarily due to higher compensation and benefits in g a partially offset by lower distribution and service fees the compensation to revenue ratio for the fourth quarter was 36 85 which is higher than the guidance we previously provided of 33 75 the increase in the ratio is primarily due to lower than forecasted revenue combined with a crude severance costs for the year the compensation to revenue ratio was 34 51 the increase in g a was primarily due to higher professional fees travel and entertainment expenses and sponsored and hosted conferences we did not incur previously anticipated revenue sharing and sub ta fees on retirement accounts at one of our intermediaries the decrease in distribution and service fee expense was primarily due to the reversal of these accrued fees during the fourth quarter as well as decreased expenses associated with lower average assets under management in us open end funds our effective tax rate for the quarter was 25 25 consistent with our prior guidance page 15 of the earnings presentation displays our cash corporate investments in us treasuries and seed investments for the current and trailing four quarters our firm liquidity totaled 213 million compared with 291 million last quarter and stockholders equity was 223 million compared with 324 million at september 30th the amount of firm liquidity and stockholders equity as of december 31st reflects the payment of a special cash dividend in december of approximately 117 million or 2 50 per share over the past nine years we have paid 11 per share in special dividends we remain debt free assets under management totaled 54 8 billion at december 31st a decrease of 5 3 billion or 9 from september 30th the decrease was driven by market depreciation of 3 2 billion net outflows of 1 2 billion and distributions of 842 million subadvised portfolios in japan had net outflows of 304 million in the quarter compared with 314 million in the third quarter outflows decelerated in the fourth quarter when compared to august and september the two months immediately following the last distribution rate cut total distributions on these portfolios totaled 363 million compared with 433 million last quarter subadvised accounts excluding japan had net outflows of 185 million primarily from client rebalancing out of global real estate us real estate and global listed infrastructure portfolios advised accounts had net inflows of 300 million during the quarter primarily from inflows into preferred and global real estate portfolios partially offset by outflows from international real estate portfolios due to client rebalancing bob steers will provide an update on our institutional pipeline and new business activity open end funds had net outflows of 1 billion during the quarter as the market decline triggered tax loss selling and retail investor redemptions distributions which included the payment of year end capital gains totaled 351 million 251 million of which were reinvested looking ahead although we remain confident in our pipeline positioning and opportunities we recognize we are in a challenging revenue environment resulting from lower assets under management going into 2019 i will briefly discuss some of the steps we are taking to manage our expense base we believe that our current headcount which includes a number of strategic hires made over the past few years provides us with meaningful operating leverage so we are taking a deliberate and measured approach to new and replacement hires although we believe this approach will control headcount growth lower assets under management resulting from the fourth quarter market decline combined with the full year impact of 2018 new hires will result in an expected compensation to revenue ratio of approximately 35 75 in 2019 we are actively reviewing all controllable expenses and are committed to reducing our non client related costs we are focused on inter office travel application licenses market data services and professional fees among other items we believe these efforts will allow us to hold the line on overall costs if not reduce them as a result we project g a for 2019 will be in line with the 46 million we recorded in 2018 but with a downward bias and finally we expect that our effective tax rate will remain at 25 25 in 2019 now i d like to turn the call over to our president joe harvey who will provide commentary on our investment performance joseph harvey president and chief investment officer thank you matt and good morning everyone i m going to discuss our investment performance and then summarize our 2019 priorities for the investment department in the fourth quarter our asset classes with the exception of midstream energy and resource equities defended much better than the s p 500 which loss 13 5 the drawdowns in us and global reits were less they were half or less of the s p 500 s decline while global infrastructure experienced even greater resistance with the decline of just 19 of the s p 500 s drop preferred s return negative 3 7 which reflected widening credit spreads which more than offset the decline of treasury yields looking at our relative investment performance in the quarter 6 of our 10 core strategies outperform their benchmarks and for the full year 9 out of 10 core strategies outperformed keep in mind that beyond our core strategies we typically have several versions of portfolios across the spectrum of risk and return as well as portfolios that represent more targeted subsets of the core strategy for example within preferred s which is counted as a single core strategy we have seven composite track records managed by our preferred and fixed income group including low duration preferreds reit preferreds and contingent capital securities measured by aum 93 of our portfolios are outperforming on a one year basis 97 are outperforming over three years and 98 are outperforming over five years 83 of our aum are in open end funds that are rated four or five star by morningstar market activity in the fourth quarter indicates that we are late cycle and is likely a harbinger of the next phase in the markets over a year ago we believe the biggest investment risk would be the transition from quantitative easing to quantitative tightening in late 2018 the market clearly became focused on the potential for a policy mistake by the fed our view is that economic growth and corporate profits have likely peaked which together with the transition from quantitative tightening to from quantitative easing to quantitative tightening could result in a stretch of higher market volatility and lower negative returns historically in late stages of the economic cycle real assets have performed well relative to stocks looking at late cycle periods going back to 1973 commodities infrastructure resource equities and reits in that order have outperformed us stocks by meaningful margins looking at the current environment as growth and return expectations decline the income provided by our reit and infrastructure strategies represents a larger proportion of return potential and together with their relative earnings stability become more attractive factors for investors in addition we believe these strategies have less risk of multiple compression as growth slows and quantitative tightening takes hold turning to the performance of our asset classes we outperformed our benchmarks in all of our reit strategies for both the fourth quarter and the full year 2018 this includes stand alone regional strategies in the us asia and europe as well as our global and international portfolios real estate was the second best performing gig sector in the s p in the quarter lifting real estates rank for 2018 to 5 out of 11 sectors after lagging the market significantly in early 2018 in infrastructure we underperformed in the quarter in part due to our overweight midstream energy and outperformed by 160 basis points for the year the asset class defended well versus stocks in part due to the utilities component of the strategy adding analyst to our infrastructure and midstream teams was a priority in 2018 and we are pleased with the calibre of new additions and our overall team size at this point we are well positioned to compete for what continues to be an active market for institutional searches and infrastructure midstream energy which was down 17 in the quarter was driven by falling oil prices and rising credit spreads tax loss selling was the factor driving many markets lower late in 2018 and it hit the midstream sector disproportionately we were surprised that midstream did not defend better because it had already undergoing a fundamental down cycle and now has accelerating fundamentals attract evaluations and yield support we underperformed in the quarter but overall had a strong year with 310 basis points of outperformance midstream shares have had a nice bounce so far in 2019 providing some resurgence in our fundamental view resource equities decline 17 on slowing economic expectations trade wars and oil price declines we outperformed in the quarter and by a 140 basis points for the year our real assets allocation team believes resource equities are statistically cheap our multi strategy real assets portfolio was down 7 for the quarter showing its diversification potential versus stocks and reflecting strong relative performance of the dispensive sectors of real estate infrastructure and high grade credit we underperformed slightly against our benchmark in the quarter but we re in line for 2018 in preferreds we outperformed for the full year albeit by a smaller margin than usual looking at our full range of strategies and preferreds and in fixed income we outperformed in six out of seven strategies for both the quarter and year considering the treasury yields may have peaked and the credit spreads have widen to more normal and supportive levels our team is more confident that our core preferred strategy will deliver at least its current yield of 6 this year if not a bit more in total return in 2018 our best performing strategy was european real estate which outperformed by 770 basis points our european real estate open end users fund is rated five stars our worst performing strategy was commodities which underperformed by 260 basis points as we have discussed on prior calls our protocol when we underperform is to activate performance remediation and improvement plans in the case of commodities we have responded by integrating quantitative techniques into our fundamental process and the initial results are promising i ll conclude my discussion today with an overview of our investment department priorities across all teams we continue to manage and prepare for the late stage environment and as a result have more balance in our portfolios i believe it is critical for active managers to outperform in the next down cycle left the industry lose more market share to index strategies while our outperformance statistics are strong we always have strategies that can do better and as mentioned commodities are our focus another goal is to deliver greater alpha from asset allocation considering that we are seeing more demand for multi strategy portfolios our three year old alpha mining project provides the foundation for performance enhancement and this year as a component of alpha mining we will dedicate resources in conjunction with our it department to quantitative techniques and data sources to complement our fundamental processes in terms of innovation we are excited by the opportunity to develop strategies for the endowment family office and ria markets these investors require strategies that are unique by virtue of having higher concentration being more targeted or having unique income or volatility profiles examples include are concentrated portfolios in real estate and midstream energy small cap infrastructure hedged real estate and an opportunistic real estate strategy we have seeded five track record accounts in these areas over the past year and are developing lp and other structures as we engage with prospective investors allocating firm resources to those areas were active management is in demand and appreciate it will provide growth for our firm as well as career paths and creative outlets for our investment professionals finally we will continue to optimize our use of external research and manage toward lowering these costs we have made meaningful progress on this front over the past two years spurred by method regulations and market practices in europe and we will transition to the last phase of this initiative as the sec evaluates commission versus hard dollar arrangements in the united states in summary our investment department is well positioned for 2019 i will now turn the call over to bob steers robert h steers chief executive officer thank you joe and good morning everyone as we all know by now last quarter and especially december saw capital markets and asset flows that were volatile complex and influenced by tax considerations these conditions induced investors across the spectrum to initiate risk reduction tax loss and rebalancing strategies with the end result in high levels of money in motion this market reaction also compressed and illuminated both the cyclical and secular challenges facing the active management industry although we were not immune from these market conditions we remain well positioned and confident that market conditions notwithstanding we will generate positive organic growth this year as reported we experienced net outflows of 1 2 billion in the quarter the overwhelming majority of which was derived from our open end funds it s our belief that the retail outflows were predominantly a year end phenomenon which will be at least partially reversed in the first quarter consistent with the trends in recent quarters the institutional advisory segment enjoyed robust investor demand and continued positive net flows but our subadvisory flows in the aggregate remain challenged in the quarter specifically with respect to the wealth channel tax loss selling and concerned regarding the widening of yield spreads had a major impact on our preferred securities open end fund flows in the quarter in total our open end funds had 1 billion of net outflows with the two preferred security funds accounting for virtually all of that amount flows into our real estate and infrastructure funds were essentially flat however our industry leading midstream energy fund buck the sector trends and delivered 42 million of net inflows our optimism regarding the wealth channels returned positive flows this quarter and year is grounded in a number of relevant fundamental factors first we expect a not insignificant portion of the tax loss motivated redemptions out of our preferred securities funds to return secondly consistent alpha generation across the range of our real asset and alternative income strategies has resulted in seven of our funds being added to 23 recommended list across 11 distribution partners during 2018 and importantly that positive trend has continued into this year third given the recent market and economic backdrop defensive dividend paying equity strategies have been upgraded and recommended by some of our biggest distribution partners although it s early flows this thus far this month are validating these expectations similar to the wealth channel advisory flows were also elevated in the quarter but ended with 300 million of net inflows as you may recall we began the fourth quarter with a 1 175 million pipeline of awarded but unfunded mandate during the quarter 255 million of that pipeline backlog was funded in addition to that amount 545 million of new mandates mainly in global real estate and multi strat real assets were both awarded and funded in the quarter for an aggregate realized funding of 800 million in total we won 785 million of new mandates leaving the end of quarter unfunded pipeline at approximately 1 billion beyond the existing pipeline we are awaiting the outcome of a record 2 5 billion plus of undecided finals current client net outflows totaled 495 million of which 133 million were terminations with the remainder attributable to rebalancing or withdrawals for other purposes anecdotally institutional investors who have historically invested in real assets privately by now inquiring and or allocating to listed strategies it appears to us that the private market expected irrs have declined sufficiently to make listed a more competitive risk adjusted investment option in addition concerns regarding heightened volatility and slowing global growth rates are motivating institutional investors to favor more liquid alternative investments in any event search activities remain elevated globally there were several significant developments in the subadvisory ex japan channel in addition to the net outflows of 185 million which reflect an evolution in that market and in our assessment and approach to this distribution channel fee pressures in combination with an absence of control over sales or marketing strategies make certain relationships that are not strategic in nature less attractive relative to our proprietary business development opportunities in europe as you know we are actively growing our own fund and distribution capabilities aimed at the wealth channel which has created a conflict over exclusivity with a current global real estate subadvisory client given the choice between delegating our emea wealth business to a third party or further developing our own we have elected to decline to grant exclusivity and to agree to terminate this relationship total aum managed for this client is approximately 800 million and we anticipate the transition to occur later this year it s our hope and expectation that in due course we will generate sufficient sales in our own funds to replace these assets with competitive fees and greater control of our brand separately as expected the balance of our 425 million large cap value subadvisory mandate has been terminated which constitutes the remainder of our large cap value subadvisory aum partially offsetting these future outflows is an expected 320 million inflow into global real estate from a long term and strategic subadvisory client which is also included in our pipeline japanese subadvisory net outflows showed improvement both before and after distributions versus the third quarter but remained elevated at 304 million and 667 million respectively with reits recently generating strong absolute and relative returns and with last year s top selling funds mainly technology focused now out of favor there appears to be an opportunity to regain investor interest this year is off to a good start with positive net inflows into our us reit funds thus far in january in contrast to the well documented headwinds facing long only managers which were highly visible last quarter we are as optimistic as ever for this coming year from a tactical standpoint our real asset and alternative income track records are strong across the board retail allocations to these strategies are rising and we are on more recommended and focus list than ever before institutionally hereto our performance solidifies a leadership position in our liquid alternative strategies at a point in the economic and capital market cycles when allocations to our space arising and listed appears to be as or more attractive than the private market alternatives strategically we continue to shift and migrate products and personnel toward markets that understand and appreciate our value proposition over the last three years institutional advisory assets under management have grown from 7 6 billion to 12 1 billion while subadvisory assets have declined from 18 5 billion to 12 5 billion inclusive of today s disclosures within the wealth channel assets under management derived from the rapidly growing independent ria channel now stand at 7 billion and growing which now exceeds our broker dealer assets under management of 6 billion not coincidentally our average fee rate during this three year period has risen from 54 2 basis points to 57 9 basis points to support and accelerate these trends this year we will be offering as joe mentioned a new series of focused and thematic strategies that will be unique and targeted at the endowment foundation ocio ria single and multi family office markets we are confident that we can grow assets in those markets that value performance and diversification along with competitive fees this initiative in conjunction with our existing business development activity will enhance our ability to generate positive and profitable organic growth for the foreseeable future with that i ll hand the call back to the operator and open the floor to questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from ari ghosh of credit suisse please go ahead ari ghosh credit suisse analyst hey good morning everyone brian heller senior vice president and corporate counsel good morning ari ghosh credit suisse analyst matt maybe you can take the first one just on the 2019 comp ratio of 35 75 that you mentioned is that projection based on 4q aum levels are you baking in any market improvement that we ve seen over the last three weeks and then just to confirm like the starting point that you mentioned for g a was 46 million and you expect that to remain flattish for full year 2019 all else equal matthew s stadler executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so with the comp ratio i mean you know we do our own internal forecasts but you know we are starting off at our year end aum levels and you know we re making assumptions like you guys do on flows and markets and although we are going to have a very tight control on headcount you know there s always going to be one or two that need to be added for strategic and important data gathering reasons so our comp ratio is based on that obviously it s you know january 24th so very early on it s our best guess of where we are at the moment and you know as the year unfolds you know we ll react accordingly but we feel good with that number just based on the 54 billion you know of where we re starting the g a in my points i ve cited the non gaap g a for the year because there s sometimes little confusion since we don t provide a non gaap income statement but yes we expect g a to be flat to 2018 but with a downward bias so but although we don t have a quantified numbers we re extremely busy looking at all of our expense base and would be disappointed honestly if we round up flat to 2018 robert h steers chief executive officer if i could just add maybe a little color starting the year with assets that were so depressed and with negative momentum in the marketplace i think our philosophy whether it s considering the inputs to a comp ratio or our approach to managing controllable expenses has been to plan for the worst and hope for the best so i would say that our approach to cost management our approach to assessing or projecting net flows or market are very conservative ari ghosh credit suisse analyst got it that s helpful and then just if you could provide any color on retail trends maybe that you seen early in 2019 especially in your preferred funds and then on the 2 5 billion of mandates and consideration that you called out are these from new client relationships existing clients is it lumpy nature and any you know if you could provide some information on that that d be great as well thank you robert h steers chief executive officer sure the we ve had positive flows into virtually all of our open end funds and so far this quarter by a wide margin the greatest inflows are into our preferred securities fund and so as we anticipated ending the quarter and beginning the year i think we re seeing a combination of some of the tax law selling coming back but frankly new investors excited about the investment opportunity there but we re seeing a solid flows into real estate funds as well so so far so good the pipeline or the 2 5 plus billion that we re waiting to hear from represents all new clients it s a little lumpy in that as i mentioned in my comments what we re seeing is a quite a number of very large institutions both domestically and outside the united states who have heretofore invested in real assets almost exclusively through private investing are pursuing the public markets now for the reasons i mentioned and so i think the 2 5 billion is a minimum there s others in the pipeline that haven t got into the finals stage yet so it s not just one or two but it is large and a little bit lumpy ari ghosh credit suisse analyst very helpful thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of john dunn evercore isi please go ahead john dunn evercore isi analyst good morning you guys had gross sales go up yeah i think in the four major categories up 33 i think quarter over quarter so you guys are selling a lot of stuff can you talk about that side of net flows maybe where that aggregate number could go and maybe what a little bit environment in 2019 would mean for it matthew s stadler executive vice president and chief financial officer it s hard to really get a trend of your gross inflows and outflows i think it s encouraging that in the open end funds we saw a large increase in our inflows showing that there is interest in our in lot of our real estate funds that we re where we were seeing the inflows occur you know the outflows were distorted as we mentioned because of the client redemptions and tax law selling but yeah we re encouraged by that trend i mean i think we re looking to have lower outflows and maybe sustain the trajectory and the inflows and that s where we re kind of optimistic in the wealth channel for 2019 robert h steers chief executive officer hey john as we talked about as you know the fourth quarter and particularly december was pretty wild and woolly the volatility was extreme and so it triggered all sorts of strategies tax losses being kind of the most obvious but there were plenty of others so i think it s hard to extrapolate too much from there i think it s more instructive to focus on the fundamental factors that i refer to so one you know top quartile top decile funds are selling anything lower than that is not asset allocations to defensive dividend paying uncorrelated asset classes like ours are rising they re both in the wealth channel which is i think you re seeing shifts away from high risk on call it technology and related strategies to more defensive strategies that accrues to our benefit in real estate infrastructure prefers as well and the trends we re saying institutionally so you know we re you know it s only been three weeks but with the exception of subadvisory we have solid positive flows in every channel i d like to extrapolate the rest of the year from that but so far so good john dunn evercore isi analyst got it and then little more in japan and it looks to us like flows have improved in january and if that holds it would be quicker than other recovery periods in the last couple distribution cut cycles are you guys see in that and is inaudible would doing anything different this time around robert h steers chief executive officer you know there s a number of i think positive fundamental issues or developments one is and some of you have inquired the regulatory pressure which began two or three years ago on these monthly higher dividend paying funds appears to have waned and is no longer it s no longer depressing marketing activity to the top selling funds of last year were funds like robotics and ai and you know what i would call more speculative funds and they had a very poor end of year those funds are not selling any longer the need for income continues to be extreme and unabated in japan and so and i would also add that one of the two us reit funds the larger of the two has actually been in positive flows for several months now so i think the time between the last cuts and now has helped the regulatory pressure dissipating perhaps gone completely now and the again not unlike domestically a shift in investor appetite more toward dividend paying defensive strategies i would also point out as joe show alluded to we were the number one performing reit fund in japan last year ahead of you know a fairly large group of decent competitors john dunn evercore isi analyst got you thanks very much guys operator thank you our next question comes from michael carrier of bank of america please go ahead michael carrier bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks guys matt maybe first one just for you just on the expenses you know you mentioned forecasting it you know based on your outlook and obviously the tougher start with the december follow because as we think about going through the year maybe just update us on how you think about what portion is variable in case the revenue environment gets a little bit tougher and i think you had some severance in the quarter i just wanted to make sure we had the right amount just so we re thinking about adjusting that out matthew s stadler executive vice president and chief financial officer yes on the comp side so and we said that the variation from the third to fourth quarter was primarily severance it was about 0 025 if you re just thinking about getting a better run rate our ratio of controllable to non controllable is about 30 being controllable that said even in the non controllable expenses as we had done a few years back there s always opportunity with vendors with number of users of a system and things of that nature so you know we re looking at everything that s why i say that at worse we would expect it to be flat to 2018 but we would be disappointed if we weren t able to achieve some sales year over year michael carrier bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay thanks and then maybe one for joe or bob so you see when i look at in all your comments you re helpful in terms of the outlook but when you know you kind of look at the outlook you have kind of the hardest thing i mean you have the performance with a lot bad manners and it s a challenge so when you look at what you re hearing from some of the clients both the wins and some of the either the reallocation or the redemptions as some of the headwinds been you know more from like a cyclical standpoint and maybe that is shifting as bob you mentioned has there been you know new product competition that s been coming in you know into some of the categories or is it just been changes you know in some of the distribution dynamics i mean where you re strong you know versus maybe where you know you have more kind of penetration or work to do i m just trying to get a sense you know in some of the drivers because obviously the performance is there i mean it sounds like your tone on the outlook is more favorable robert h steers chief executive officer mike it sounds like your question is focused mainly on retail is that right michael carrier bank of america merrill lynch analyst yeah i think yeah probably mostly on the retail side because on the institutional side you gave a lot of you know lot of color robert h steers chief executive officer sure well look it s no secret on the retail side we compete with passive ats consistently and we re one of the few managers that is a net inflows in the active long only reit space for example and passive continues to compete well we see some other products we have some private equity firms that are have been in the market with non traded real estate products and you know historically the competition is mainly because we re competing against the brand name historically those products do not perform well so over a full cycle we end up getting those assets back but you know it is more competitive that said i think what s in our favor is as you know your firm and others are narrowing their list of managers and in particular much much greater emphasis on recommended and even more important focus lists and look we re the category killer we re on the recommended list we re on focus list and so in many ways we have many fewer competitors the generic reit or infrastructure or even mlp mutual fund which is a two three or even four stars is not on the focus list and so our partners actually helped to elevate our performance and really provide a much stronger platform for us to continue to gain market share and i would point out we continue to gain market share in the retail channel and virtually every strategy that we manage versus active manager so to me the winners are those that can deliver that kind of performance and passive and the losers are the active managers who cannot deliver five star performance joseph harvey president and chief investment officer i just had from a market appetite perspective from asset allocation perspective looking back backward for the past two years a lot of our strategies have been seeing headwinds from the perspective of rising interest rates whether it s reit strategies or preferred strategies midstream energy not so much it s the issues there have been more the fundamental cycle but you know when you think about the comments i made on how the macro economic environment is turning and if we are in fact seeing a peeking process in the bond yields that headwind could turn to tailwinds bob mentioned that we ve seen several strategies may put by recommendations on defensive equity strategies that have high income components and earnings profiles that are more stable and so it could be that if we get this if the macro plays out as we suspect you know we could have some of those headwinds turn into tailwinds or maybe two neutral winds robert h steers chief executive officer mike if i could also just add a little color on the institutional side so whereas some of those private equity firms are trying to raise retail assets as joe and i outlined and in consistent with our goal to be able to generate both positive net organic growth and rising fees not declining fees we are introducing early this year some strategies that are not in 40 act wrappers that are going to be marketed to some of the same whether its family offices ocios and the endowment foundation markets that you know here the four have been mainly dominated by private equity firms and so you know we think those investors have the deep knowledge of the value of an asset allocation to real assets and alternative income strategies they like highly concentrated focused thematic limited capacity strategies and obviously we re not competing with passive fees in those channels so we re very excited about this initiative michael carrier bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay thanks a lot operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from mac sykes of g research please go ahead mac sykes g research analyst good morning everyone matthew s stadler executive vice president and chief financial officer hi mac robert h steers chief executive officer hi mac mac sykes g research analyst bob you outlined some moving parts in europe but i just want to make sure i have this right it sounds like the fee rates will benefit from a future product mix so as we move wealth and away from subadvisory there at the moment so when i think about that accurate contribution will that be additive to the overall fee rate robert h steers chief executive officer yeah i think the combination of lower fee business sort of being flat and higher fee business showing the greatest organic growth you know that is what we hope will be the engine that will keep our fee rates certainly from declining if not possibly even migrating a little bit higher mac sykes g research analyst okay and then could you just comment a little more on fundraising europe in general just given some of the noise around the brexit assuming we do get some clarity on those politics in the next couple months could that be a catalyst for an acceleration in your progress there robert h steers chief executive officer you know that s a tough question institutionally we re not you know we re seeing strong investor interest there s been no diminution of accelerating demand on the institutional side the wealth side as we ve talked about previously is coming along more slowly than we originally expected but it is coming along and part of that issue is there are some significant institutions that are not going to recommend or focus on our funds until they get to a critical mass of 200 million to 300 million which we expect to achieve in our key funds this year but i don t think we ve really seen any impact from brexit other than our own contingency planning there mac sykes g research analyst okay and then my last just two questions two parter the new series funds that you ve outlined are they being launched with seeded track records and then how are you thinking about the margins in that business versus the overall business robert h steers chief executive officer well there s a wide range of approaches to those strategies there are several strategies that are now very much in demand our concentrated strategies in global and us real estate that have 15 and 20 year track records and for one of those we re looking at an lt structure when we launch a new fund we typically need to put in some capital there are other strategies where we ve just newly developed them and we don t have long track records but for the target markets that we talked about we don t think you necessarily have to have a track record especially if you are managing a spinoff strategy or an extension of the things that we re well known for but we ll have a variety of approaches there will be some vehicles involved others will be offered as separate accounts in terms of the question of the profitability we believe we can get attractive fees relative to our current fees one of the issues however is that these investors like strategies that are unique and sometimes have limited capacity so we may not be able to achieve the scale that in some of these strategies that we have historically with broader mainstream strategies mac sykes g research analyst great thank you very much robert h steers chief executive officer if i just could add quickly to that what those strategies also do is frequently when we offer unique strategies like that we end up managing two three four additional strategies with the same client so even though a strategy may be capacity constrained oftentimes we end up adding assets in related strategies global real estate infrastructure and so forth operator thank you our next question comes from robert lee kbw please go ahead robert lee kbw analyst great thank you thanks for taking my questions most of them have been answered but just a couple of minor things maybe but you had mentioned that in distribution services expenses in the quarter benefited from some prior reversals can you maybe just kind of size that for us so we can get a sense of kind of what the run rate is and then maybe a follow on on the expense side i m assuming that q1 will have some there s normally some seasonal upward pressure in comp just as you pay fica taxes and things like that matthew s stadler executive vice president and chief financial officer right so thanks rob we with respect to the frictional costs on the payment of the bonuses and everything we actually accrue those during 2018 so the comp ratio that we had mentioned would be a good comp ratio to use for the first quarter inclusive of paying out the bonuses which all those costs had been previously accrued so nothing unique for us there on the distribution i would say if you want to size it up it s about it s between 400 000 and 500 000 a quarter it was one of our larger intermediaries that had indicated toward the end of 2017 that they would be initiating rev share on certain retirement assets that we have with them and they didn t bill us and so whether or not it s going to get resurrected in 2019 is unclear but we closed 2018 with a provision that we didn t need so we reversed it robert lee kbw analyst okay great and then maybe just a follow up question on any advisory i mean could you maybe and i apologize if you mentioned this early on but give us a sense of some of the geographic breakdown of where you re having the most success there and maybe give us update us again on your view of what s maybe driving that on the geographic basis robert h steers chief executive officer well we re seeing demand mainly from north america europe and the middle east we re not there s very little of that of the pipeline or the pipeline we re waiting to hear about very little of that is from asia so it s really north america europe the middle east and i think what s driving it is the factors that joe and i touched on already importantly i think a significant part of that is sort of a multi strat opportunities that we re seeing and we re seeing it from public funds we re seeing it from middle eastern entities we re seeing endowments who are interested in not one of our strategies but three to five of our strategies and some of the larger pools are interested in essence outsourcing their listed real estate or infrastructure allocation to a single provider and so you know it s really not to dissimilar from wealth where again you re seeing the intermediaries saying we re going to identify the two or three top decile top quartile managers and everyone else is going to not have shelf space and i think you re seeing the same thing institutionally where large institutions are looking to establish strategic relationships with people with firms that dominate their asset classes and they re handing over a wide swath of their portfolios albeit they have greater feed negotiating positions but these are great relationships because they re large and they re very long term they re strategic and that s the key to our thinking today is whether subadvisory or elsewhere we re focused on developing strategic relationships not just any robert lee kbw analyst and maybe as a follow up to the advisory channel just curious if you re seeing any increased interest or maybe demand from some institutional accounts to put in place some type of performance fee structure maybe a lower ongoing management fee and then having some kind of performance fee on top of that is are you seeing any of that robert h steers chief executive officer it depends on the strategy yes we re seeing some of that and but again i think there is historically in our experience there s been two approaches that we ve seen clients with respect to performance fees one is a somewhat cynical approach of just cutting fees so that if you deliver massive alpha you can get back to your base fee and as you would expect your ability to negotiate fees that are fair for both parties is a function of how strong your performance is how unique your strategies are and i think that s why if you re in core style boxes you have no choice but to acquiesce whereas the types of strategies that joe outlined nobody else is doing and very few can do so it s the that s one of the reasons that we like the new areas and markets that we re focusing on but yes for the large cap more generic strategies there are clients who are interested in having that discussion robert lee kbw analyst great thanks for taking my questions operator thank you there are no further questions at this time i will turn the call to chief executive officer bob steers for closing remarks please go ahead sir robert h steers chief executive officer great well thank you all for calling in this morning and we look forward to speaking to you after the first quarter thank

forecast prices used in estimates net reserves are the company s working interest share after the deduction of royalties net reserves in egypt include the company s share of future cost recovery and production sharing oil after the government s royalty based interest but before reserves relating to income taxes payable under this method a portion of the reported reserves will increase as oil prices decrease and vice versa as the barrels necessary to achieve cost recovery change with prevailing oil prices possible reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves there is a 10 probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the sum of proved plus probable plus possible reserves 2018 reserve changes reserves at 2018 year end were lower compared to 2017 year end primarily due to the production of 5 3 mmboe which were substantially offset by 3 5 mmboe gross 2p reserves basis of net positive revisions the 3 5 mmboe of net positive revisions reflect additions from discoveries extensions and improved recovery of 3 9 mmboe in egypt 0 1 mmboe of infill drilling in canada which was offset by a 0 5 mmboe negative revision relating to minor asset performance in egypt and economic factors in canada egypt in egypt the company replaced 95 of 2018 production 4 4 mmbbl on a 1p gross reserves basis and 79 of 2018 production on a 2p gross reserves basis reserves additions from drilling came from a discovery well in south ghazalat reserves extensions from two wells in west bakr one well in nw gharib and the remaining additions coming from reserves category conversions positive reserves additions also resulted from improved recovery due to an artificial lift optimization program and technical revisions due to a recompletion program which was implemented following the west bakr phase 2 production facility expansions in 2018 the positive revisions highlighted above were partially offset by the underperformance of two minor fields in the west gharib concession canada in canada the company replaced 51 of 2018 production 0 8 mmboe on a 1p gross reserves basis and 98 of 2018 production on a 2p gross reserves basis the company drilled six gross five net cardium formation oil wells 5 one mile and 1 two mile horizontal wells completed with multi stage fracture stimulation in the harmattan area all of which represented undeveloped reserves conversions positive technical revisions resulted primarily from the 2017 drilling program outperforming forecasts allowing infill drilling reserves to be booked to this year s program the positive additions were slightly offset by the negative technical revisions associated with challenging economics for natural gas in the lone pine harmattan areas conventional natural gas reserves represent approximately 14 of the company s total 2p reserves assignment boe basis as of december 31 2018 estimated future net revenues the estimated future net

to put the reserves on production developed producing reserves are those reserves that are expected to be recovered from completion intervals open at the time of the estimate these reserves may be currently producing or if shut in they must have previously been on production and the date of resumption or production must be known with reasonable certainty developed non producing reserves are those reserves that either have not been on production or have previously been on production but are shut in and the date of resumption is unknown undeveloped reserves are those reserves expected to be recovered from known accumulations where a significant expenditure for example when compared to the cost of drilling a well is required to render them capable of production they must fully meet the

excluding transaction and integration expenses as well as special charges adjusted operating income was 298 million compared to 307 million in the year ago period the decline in adjusted operating income of 3 which included a 1 unfavorable impact of currency was driven primarily by unfavorable product mix of business as well as investments for growth and higher distribution expense during the

options during the year which were partially offset by higher interest expense and shares outstanding this increase also includes the favorable impact of foreign currency rates the company continues to generate strong cash flow net cash provided by operating activities reached a record 821 million in 2018 an increase from 815 million in 2017 driven mainly by net income growth a portion of this

addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap but they should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results in addition these non gaap financial measures may not be comparable

we are a multi national company we are subject to variability of our reported u s dollar results due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates those changes have been volatile over the past several years the exclusion of the effects of foreign currency exchange or what we refer to as amounts expressed on a constant currency basis is a non gaap measure we believe that this non gaap measure provides additional information that enables enhanced comparison to prior periods excluding the translation effects of changes in rates of foreign currency exchange and provides additional insight into the underlying performance of our operations located outside of the u s it should be noted that our presentation herein of amounts and percentage changes on a constant currency basis does not exclude the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses that is the impact of transactions denominated in other than the local currency of any of our subsidiaries in their local currency reported results percentage changes in sales and adjusted operating income expressed in constant currency are presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange to present this information for historical periods current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than the u s dollar are translated into u s dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year rather than at the actual average exchange rates in effect during the current fiscal year as a result the foreign currency impact is equal to the current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in the average foreign currency exchange rate between the current fiscal period and the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year

by egon von greyerz what is a goldbug if we look at wikipedia they define it as a person who is extremely bullish on the commodity gold as an investment and or a standard for measuring wealth goldbug can also be used as a pejorative investopedia states that a gold bug is an individual who is very enthusiastic about gold as an investment and its prospects for significantly increasing in value finally the free dictionary defines goldbug as 1 a person especially an economist or politician who supports the gold standard or 2 a person who believes in buying gold bullion as a personal investment or 3 a gold beetle since less than 0 5 of world financial assets are in gold most people neither hold gold nor understand the purpose of gold the people who understand the real value of gold could only agree with one of the definitions above a goldbug is a gold beetle there could be no argument about that clear definition many people use goldbug scathingly as a pejorative as they have never bothered to understand the significance of gold if you understand gold you are not a goldbug so why have i and a few others been advocating the ownership of gold for the last 17 years without being goldbugs it is not because i am bullish on the gold price and want to make a quick buck nor is it because i believe in the gold standard see my article about freegold no gold has a much more profound significance the simplest definition of gold is jp morgan s money is gold and nothing else but his statement requires further clarification of course money is gold that is why gold is the only currency that has survived throughout history all other currencies have been destroyed by rulers or central bankers by issuing endless amounts of credit and printed money until the currency has become worthless and this is happening now again as all currencies have lost 97 99 in real terms since 1913 when the fed was created if we are not goldbugs what is the purpose of holding gold in simple terms gold is wealth preservation and insurance against a rotten financial system inflated by 100s of trillions of credit and printed money as well as quadrillions of dollars of derivatives if you understand the bubble that this has created in all asset and debt markets you will also understand that gold is your best protection against the coming implosion of all these markets for the ones who think it is different now i beg you to study history every single major asset and debt bubble in history has always resulted in a collapse of the currency and the financial system where it has occurred the big difference this time is that the problem is global world debt at 250 trillion is 3x global gdp an all time record and if we add unfunded liabilities and derivatives total debts and liabilities amount to over 2 quadrillion which is 25x global gdp so that is the risk that potentially could erupt into the biggest financial and economic collapse in history there is clearly no certainty that it will happen but the probability is very high governments only have one remedy which is to print more money but even a child would understand that printing more money and issuing more debt to solve a debt problem clearly doesn t add up sadly the keynesians like noble prize winner krugman don t get it you can t solve a problem by the same means that caused it in the first place holding gold a sine qua non let s look at some of the reasons why it is critical to hold physical gold gold protects against 1 currency debasement the 97 99 fall of all currencies in the last 100 years will continue until the currencies have reached zero so there is only 1 to 3 to go but remember that this fall is a 100 loss value from today 2 bank failures bail ins with leverage of 10 50x banks will not survive the next credit crunch add to that their derivatives exposure and a systemic failure is guaranteed 3 stock market collapse we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us subscribe stocks have been fuelled by money printing and buybacks and are now overvalued on all criteria a 90 fall in real terms like in 1929 is likely the economic and financial risks in the world are today exponentially greater than in the late 1920s 4 bond market failure the 35 year up cycle in bonds is now a mega bubble that will implode it turned down three years ago and rates are now on their way back to above the early 1980s level of 16 for the 10 year us treasury this is a long cycle and will not happen immediately as governments print unlimited amounts of money default or implement moratoria bond market investors including china and japan will dump their us bonds just like russia has done already 5 inflation hyperinflation as governments in a desperate and futile attempt try to save the system print endless amounts of money most major economies will have inflation leading to hyperinflation anyone who has lived in a hyperinflationary economy like argentina zimbabwe and venezuela knows that their money is totally destroyed sadly few people realise that gold would have saved them 6 deflation contrary to what many people believe gold has historically performed very well in deflationary periods in my opinion we will first have hyperinflation as governments try to save the world with money printing when that fails and asset as well as credit markets implode we will have a severe deflationary implosion banks are unlikely to survive this in their present form as banks fail so will the money in the bank gold will then be money used for payment or barter 7 peak gold gold production has already peaked there have been no major finds since the 1990s even if unexpectedly there will be substantial new discoveries it takes at least 15 years from discovery to production thus we will see substantial shortages of gold in coming years 8 paper gold the gold price is only at the currently ridiculously cheap level due to a paper gold market which determines the gold price whether it is physical or paper gold the price of gold adjusted for money supply is now at the same level as in 1970 when gold was 35 and 2000 when gold was 280 paper gold outstanding is at least 100x the physical gold backing it when paper gold holders get worried and ask for delivery there will be no gold available and price will go no offer which means there is no gold available at any price this is when gold will go to multiples of the current price 9 corporate debt corporate debt has exploded in most industrial nations and is now at danger level in the us for example corporate debt to gdp has doubled since the 1960s irrational optimism and share buy backs have fuelled this debt boom 10 other risks there are a number of other major risks which can erupt at any time these include geopolitical risks civil war social unrest country risk in china japan usa middle east emerging markets etc many of these things have already started like the us government shutdown the brexit fiasco in the uk yellow vests in france and mass migration on several continents all this is just the beginning gold is today both critical insurance superb investment gold is clearly not the panacea for all the problems listed above but there is no better insurance against the financial and economic risks in the world today which are greater than any time in history especially in periods of crisis gold is the most important wealth preservation asset as well as a store of value and medium of exchange my good friend simon mikhailovich s describes the world s mis understanding of gold perfectly if one offered investors a fat tail put option that never decays or expires costs about 1 pa to carry has no counter party risk no chance of ever becoming worthless there would be a line out the door but when one explains that this option is physical gold no interest despite or maybe because of most people s total ignorance of gold it will be the most superb asset to hold in the next few years both as insurance and for capital appreciation purposes but remember to hold physical gold and store it outside the financial system in a very safe vault and jurisdiction
the major u s index futures are pointing to a mixed opening on thursday suggesting stocks are likely to continue to experience choppy trading following the volatility seen in the previous session the futures gave back ground after commerce secretary wilbur ross told cnbc the u s is miles and miles from a trade deal with china frankly that shouldn t be too surprising ross said in an interview on cnbc s squawk box noting the u s and china have lots and lots of issues the comments from ross come ahead of chinese vice premier liu he s trip to washington next week for the next round of trade negotiations renewed concerns about a u s china trade deal have offset positive sentiment generated by a report from the labor department showing initial jobless claims fell to their lowest level in almost fifty years in the week ended january 19th stocks fluctuated over the course of the trading session on wednesday after failing to sustain an early move to the upside the major averages showed wild swings as the day progressed before ending the session in positive territory while the major averages all closed higher the dow outperformed its counterparts by a wide margin the dow climbed 171 14 points or 0 7 percent to 24 575 62 while the nasdaq crept up 5 41 points or 0 1 percent to 7 025 77 and the s p 500 inched up 5 80 points or 0 2 percent to 2 638 70 the notable advance by the dow reflected a positive reaction to quarterly results from several of the components of the blue chip index tech giant ibm corp ibm posted a standout gain after reporting fourth quarter results that beat estimates and providing upbeat guidance for 2019 shares of united technologies utx also moved notably higher after the industrial conglomerate reported fourth quarter results that exceeded analyst estimates on both the top and bottom lines consumer products giant procter gamble pg also saw significant strength after reporting better than expected fiscal second quarter results meanwhile the volatility by the broader came as traders expressed uncertainty about the economic impact of the ongoing u s government shutdown in an interview with cnn a top economic adviser to president donald trump acknowledged the shutdown could lead to a lack of economic growth in the first quarter white house council of economic advisers chairman kevin hassett conceded the u s could see zero growth if the shutdown continues for the whole quarter it is true that if we get a typically weak first quarter and extended shutdown that we could end up with a number that is very low or very close to zero hassett said however hassett predicted second quarter growth would subsequently be humongous assuming the government reopened most of the major sectors ended the day showing only modest moves although considerable weakness was visible among oil service stocks the philadelphia oil service index slumped by 2 1 percent continuing to give back ground after reaching its best closing level in over a

the 20 bond auction which saw the bid cover jump to 4 57x the most since last summer after contracting in q3 18 mostly due to disruptions caused by natural disasters the recovery in q4 seemed lackluster and 2019 is off to a soft start after hiking rates last november korea s central bank left rates on hold 1 75 but trimmed this year s growth forecast 2 6 vs 2 7 and cut the cpi forecast to

this was more than offset by the slump in services to 47 5 from 49 0 the composite fell to 47 9 a four year low outside of the two largest economies the markit survey found output growth slowed to its lowest level since november 2013 italian figures won t be out until early february but it plays on fears that the italian economy may have contracted in q4 18 after slumping in q3 for the euro area as a whole both manufacturing and services fell and the composite eased to 50 7 from 51 1 the lowest since july 2013 growing confidence that brexit will be delayed from the end of march saw the sterling approach 1 31 today after shooting above 1 30 yesterday news that the government s international trade secretary fox one of the cabinet s leading brexiters signaled a potential delay was seen as a sign that prime minister may is also moving in that direction apparently labour and other opposition parties already have done so while a postponement eases the sense of urgency some fear it extends the uncertainty which weighs on the economy norway s central bank left rates steady at 75 bp although it signaled it may still raise rates again as early as march it recognized the high degree of uncertainty the market is pricing in one hike for the norges bank this year while policymakers seem to signal two the next monetary report will be delivered on march 21 economic forecasts will be

momentum eased initial resistance is seen near gbp0 8720 north america two votes in the us senate ostensibly that could lead to the end of the partial government shutdown will be held today the biggest risk is that neither bill passes there might be some response to the headline but the failure of both bills would indicate there is not a majority for either extreme position and it would

floris bergh the namibian economy will probably show marginally positive growth in 2019 of 1 5 percent in real terms this outcome will largely be the result of a flattening out of the down cycle rather than a real recovery the down cycle has been evident since 2016 and carried over throughout 2017 and 2018 in fact we expect that the economy as a whole contracted in 2018 in real terms amongst the primary sectors 2018 was a mixed year with agriculture and fishing struggling whilst mining experienced a bounce for the latter it was only the second positive year over the past five we look for somewhat positive growth from these three sectors in 2019 similarly amongst the secondary sectors 2018 was mixed with manufacturing contracting by an estimated 5 percent whereas electricity water and construction are expected to have done reasonably well bear in mind that construction contracted by more than 25 percent in each of the preceding two years a sharp severe recession in the sector looking forward there should be somewhat of a recovery from a low base in these sectors the tertiary sector encompassing mostly services is where amongst others the role of government is taken into account the fiscus has been under tremendous pressure which of necessity stifled growth in government spending and hence economic growth retail wholesale trade has contracted by an estimated 4 9 percent in 2018 some other industries like transport post telecoms financial real estate and business services were positive but hotels restaurants were negative according to the official national accounts ideally in a situations like this a country could use fiscal policy to stimulate the economy increasing spending on say infrastructure or wages gives final demand in the economy a boost and hence lifts the growth rate however namibia does not have any fiscal manoeuvrability debt levels spending levels and deficits are already too high and threaten the country s creditworthiness tax cuts another option is a tax cut which leaves more disposable income in the pockets of taxpayers they then might opt to increase their spending and hence lift the growth rate however this means that the government s deficit will increase and therefore runs into the same fiscal constraints in fact the pressures are such that namibians are likely facing tax hikes rather than cuts a tax cut may also worsen the balance of payments deficit if it leads to increased imports as far as inflation goes it is quite possible that namibia will have a somewhat higher rate in 2019 before it decreases again in 2020 seasonal patterns in the constituents of the inflation basket as well as low inflation in early 2018 the so called base effect will probably contribute to a 6 percent plus rate at times during the year thereafter we expect it to average about 5 5 percent in 2020 this means that namibians should not expect wage increases much above 5 6 percent the lower petrol price and a stronger than expected currency will also help to ensure that as in namibia there won t be a break out in inflation in neighbouring sa in fact the south african reserve bank sarb lowered its inflation outlook and now does not expect inflation to breach the upper band of 6 percent at any stage over the next three years this means that policy driven interest rates will largely be stable in namibia and sa for the foreseeable future in the absence of black swans nasty surprises the weakness in the real economy does not justify higher interest rates on the contrary it rather calls for policy support which increases talk that the next move in rates could be down global developments also align with lower rather than higher interest rates and do not offer much support for the real economy the chinese economy is slowing due to bruising tariffs weaker consumer confidence and lower demand for its exports this is not good news for commodity exporters europe is beset with issues that are growth negative brexit yellow vests and bad loans germany and for that matter japan are struggling to prevent an economic contraction the usa economy seems to be going strong however deteriorating global sentiment and domestic political shenanigans coupled with rising interest rates are stoking fears that a recession is not far away the world is experiencing a growth scare similar to that of late 2015 and early 2016 this has affected financial markets badly especially equity markets the s p500 the jse nikkei etc markets usually stop panicking when policymakers start to panic and then after exhausting all other avenues decide to do the right thing our wish list for 2019 and beyond is as follows a good rainy season this will give agriculture a boost even though it has become smaller and smaller as a percent of gdp agriculture affects an outsized number of people directly and the knock on effects are significant there seems to be a high degree of uncertainty regarding what to expect from the rainy season further afield a weak form of el nino seems to be developing which may or may not have an impact on namibia s rain as well as global food prices an external boost to the economy like good rains may just be the tipping point to get us through the worst another positive boost could come from better than expected intra regional trade which will boost the income pool of the southern african customs union this in turn will alleviate the pressure on the fiscus and might prevent tax hikes sanity prevails in the political arena this includes a sensible resolution to the bruising global trade war the us government shutdown and brexit amongst other things add to this the wish that elections in namibia and sa this year lead to outcomes that are better for all concerned remember that the decibels will rise sharply in the run up to these clarity and sensibility as far as domestic policy issues are concerned it is critically important that these are settled the golden thread that runs through the modern economic system and holds it all together is confidence and confidence is based on clarity of purpose and predictability of policy here we refer to things like legislative changes land reform neeef tax rates and the currency peg all of which have been hot topics of late then our entrepreneurs will not lose heart we desperately need them to create or at least maintain jobs this is an environment where we must all show our mettle and draw on the reservoirs of goodwill that exist within the nation as far as investment portfolio implications go then a cautious approach is still called for interest bearing assets should continue to provide a reasonably attractive nearly risk free return in a fluid and uncertain macro environment this means that money market returns and bond yields generally remain attractive vs other asset classes as well as vs inflation inflation linked bonds are also an asset class that deserve consideration it protects income and capital against inflation and as such serves as a hedge against de pegging risk perhaps the best cautious approach is to stick to a plan and or a strategy that is in line with one s personal goals circumstances risk tolerance and time horizon by all means rebalance a bit however bear in mind that asset values have already adjusted and are now discounting to the present present value a very bleak outlook future value the future may not be what it used to be but it should prove to be better than what is currently expected floris bergh is the chief economist at capricorn asset

detailed in our sec filings you may find today s press release and our sec filings on our web page at popular com advertisement advertisement i will now turn the call over to our ceo ignacio alvarez ignacio alvarez president and chief executive officer good morning and thank you for joining the call today s results reflect another solid quarter and a strong finish to the year before i cover the highlights for 2018 i am pleased to report that today we announced a series of planned capital actions that we intend to execute this year these actions include an increase in the company s quarterly common stock dividend from 0 25 to 0 30 per share beginning in the second quarter of 2019 and a common stock repurchase program up to 250 million these actions evidence the strength of our capital position which allows us to return capital to our shareholders as we invest in our franchise to ensure its continued success please turn to slide 3 early in 2018 we were addressing remaining hurricane related issues and there was much uncertainty regarding the recovery of the puerto rico economy despite these challenges we remain focused on serving our customers executing our business strategies and seizing opportunities that arose i am extremely proud of our employees thanks to their efforts we overcame the challenges raised by the hurricanes to achieve strong financial results and accomplish important milestone for example we completed the wells fargo acquisition achieved the successful termination of our loss share agreements with the fdic and executed several capital actions including 125 million common stock repurchase advertisement advertisement for the full year 2018 we reported net income of 618 million which includes the benefit recognized on the early termination of the fdic loss share agreements during the second quarter and the expense related to the impact of the recently enacted tax reform in puerto rico on a deferred tax asset excluding these items adjusted net income was 487 million up from the prior year s adjusted net income of 276 million in 2017 we had the negative effects of the hurricanes while in 2018 we benefited from deposit growth and higher interest rates as well as the contribution of the reliable acquisition credit quality results for the year were positive in puerto rico most metrics were better than or close to pre hurricane levels in the us credit quality was solid throughout the year except for the taxi medallion portfolio that now has a carrying value of less than 50 million our capital levels are strong with year end tier 1 capital and tier 1 common ratios at 16 9 in puerto rico we increased our deposits by 14 and our net interest margin was 4 27 in our us operations we grew commercial loans by 7 and our deposit base by 4 and increased our margin please turn to slide 5 to discuss the highlights of the fourth quarter in the fourth quarter popular reported net income of 106 million excluding the impact of the dta valuation adjusted net income was 134 million compared to last quarter s net income of 141 million adjusted results were driven by continued topline growth and a reduction provision partially offset by higher expenses the increase in expenses was driven by costs related to the early extinguishment of debt our profit sharing plan and the previously announced voluntary retirement program in which 313 employees elected to participate this program facilitates our colleagues transition to retirement and allows us to provide talent development opportunities and facilitate mobility within the organization net interest income was 25 million higher than the previous quarter mainly due to an additional month of earnings from reliable we had another quarter of positive credit results with lower npls and stable inflows the increase in net charge offs was driven by two large commercial relationships in puerto rico which were partially offset by lower mortgage and consumer charge offs lidio will expand on these results later in the call advertisement advertisement before i turn the call over to carlos i will share some metrics we track and comment on the progress we re seeing in puerto rico our customers debit and credit card activity reflected increased spending spending for 2018 rose by 22 compared to 2017 and 2016 and 29 compared to 2015 trends regarding consumer activity are also encouraging our originations were 35 higher than 2017 driven by auto and personal loans and 13 higher than in 2016 the auto industry continued to do extremely well new units sold in 2018 reached 108 000 28 higher than the previous year and the highest figure in the last 12 years the mortgage business has not recovered as well our estimates point to a slight market contraction during 2018 as compared to the previous year on the positive side home sales in 2018 reached their highest level in the last six years on the commercial loan side we have not yet seen loan growth but we expect additional learning opportunities to arise as the economy continues to recover we believe that continued economic growth and larger projects should generate additional demand for financing cement sales often considered an indicator of the healthy economy showed continued strength up 41 year to date versus 2017 and 26 higher than in 2016 total employment which includes self employed individuals increased by 1 6 during 2018 the unemployment rate was 8 3 one of the lowest in recent decades as of december salaried employment had stabilized down 2 1 from september 2017 but up 0 8 since december 2017 this improvement was driven by an increase of 1 7 in private sector jobs partially offset by 1 8 decline in public employment with respect to migration trends the most recently released passenger data from the san juan airport reflects that the net number of people who left the island from september 2017 to september 2018 was approximately 150 000 this is a significant amount but much lower than initial estimate despite the decline in population popular s customers have continued to increase excluding approximately 30 000 new unique customers brought in with reliable transaction our customer base in puerto rico increased by approximately 58 000 since the hurricane and by 50 000 in 2018 in short based on the metrics we re seeing the recovery of the puerto rico economy following the storm continues to be steady the sustainability and pace of the recovery will however be heavily dependent on the magnitude and timing of federal recovery and private insurance funds flowing into the island insurance companies have disbursed approximately 5 billion out of an amount estimated by the puerto rico fiscal oversight board to reach 8 billion advertisement advertisement regarding federal funds close to 9 billion was disbursed in fiscal 2018 in emergency relief assistance to individuals public corporations and municipalities while the flow cbdg ph disaster recovery funds has been slower than many hoped it appears that these funds should begin to be disbursed in the first half of 2019 the current puerto rico government fiscal plan anticipates an additional 13 billion of federal and insurance funds to be disbursed in fiscal year 2019 and over 50 billion in the next eight years these inflows will undoubtedly have a stimulative impact on the economy however the effect will be tempered somewhat by the government austerity measures imposed by the revised fiscal plan looking beyond the immediate stimulative effects of the recovery process the island s long term prospects will depend on the decisions regarding puerto rico s rebuilding and the implementation of necessary structural reform it is imperative that we take the advantage of this unique opportunity to implement those reforms that are essential to achieving a long term sustainable growth this will require discipline and increased cooperation between the fiscal oversight board and the local government i will now turn the call over to carlos who will discuss the financial results in more detail carlos vazquez executive vice president and chief financial officer advertisement advertisement thank you ignacio good morning before we turn to the fourth quarter results let me start by expanding on ignacio s summary of popular s full year 2018 performance 2018 was a dynamic year for popular in which we achieved quite a lot our net interest income increased by 16 year over year to 1 7 billion on the back of strong long growth along with a net interest margin that exceeded 4 our acquisition of wells fargo s puerto rico auto finance business closed in the third quarter and has already yielded significant benefits as did the early termination of the fdic loss share agreements which we executed in the second quarter additionally in the last two quarters we repaid 450 million in 7 senior debt and replace it with 300 million in 1 125 ph senior debt our provision expense decrease in 2018 by approximately 29 to 226 million given the 2017 hurricane related expenses excluding the 2018 benefits from terminating the fdic loss share agreements fee income increased by approximately 30 year over year driven by improvement across all segments operating expenses increased by 13 year over year to 1 4 billion higher personnel cost professional fees and five months worth of reliable expenses were the primary drivers of the increase our capital position was robust in the beginning of the year and ended the year at even stronger levels with tangible book value per share increasing by nearly 4 to 46 90 and common equity tier 1 ratio improved by 60 basis points to 16 9 this capital improvement was achieved even after the repurchase of 125 million of common stock and the reliable acquisition for 1 9 billion please turn to slide 5 for the fourth quarter results note that additional information is provided on slide 6 and the appendix to the slide deck today s earnings press release details variances from the third quarter which were driven by higher net interest income higher fee income and lower loan loss provision offset in part by higher operating expenses and higher taxes advertisement advertisement net interest income for the quarter was 476 million up 25 million from the third quarter the increase was driven by higher loan volumes mainly in our auto business in puerto rico as well as higher volumes and rates on investments partially offset by higher volumes and cost of interest bearing deposits additionally the early payoff of westernbank commercial loan resulted in the recognition of 5 7 million ph in income in the quarter our net interest margin was 4 25 up 18 basis points from last quarter the contribution from reliable was the primary driver of the sequential improvement adding 9 basis points to the nim the yield on earning assets increased 23 basis points in bppr and 20 basis points in popular bank total deposit cost in the quarter increased 9 basis points to 65 basis points the cost of our interest bearing deposits was up 11 basis points to 83 basis points mostly due to higher volume and rate for puerto rico public sector deposits and higher deposit cost in the us the retail and corporate deposit segments in puerto rico saw small increase in costs of 2 basis points during the quarter we deployed cash for the purchase of investment securities adding approximately 400 million of treasury securities these investments achieved more attractive after tax yields without adding credit risk or materially changing the characteristics of the investment portfolio the overall duration of the bond portfolio is still under three years we are pleased with the financial performance of the reliable acquisition especially considering the strong demand in the auto lending sector in puerto rico the combined retail portfolio of reliable and popular auto grew by 170 million ph during q4 the results for the quarter include approximately 18 million in net income contribution from reliable compared to approximately 12 million in the third quarter the acquisition is performing better than anticipated we now expect reliable to contribute a range of 55 million to 60 million of net income in 2019 including servicing fee income and conversion cost advertisement advertisement focusing on loan growth we still anticipate slight growth in overall loan balances for popular in 2019 driven by continued growth in the us and stable balances in puerto rico our provision in the fourth quarter decreased by almost 12 million lidio will provide more details on credit during his commentary in the fourth quarter non interest income increased slightly reflecting a benefit of 9 million from the valuation of our msr offset by lower other operating income loan modification fee income decreased by 7 million from the third quarter having completed the majority of the hurricane related mortgage modifications we do not expect this item to be material moving forward additionally other operating income for the quarter included 10 million in hurricane related recoveries consistent with the third quarter we think most material hurricane related insurance claims of popular have now been closed our puerto rico mortgage business originated 164 million loans in the fourth quarter a decrease from 172 million in the third quarter originations continued to trend at a pace below pre storm levels total operating expenses for the quarter were 396 million up 31 million from the prior quarter as discussed during last quarter s webcast in the fourth quarter we recognized an expense related to the early retirement program this number at approximately 19 million is slightly higher than our previous estimate of 13 million due to a larger acceptance rate by employees the program is expected to reduce salary expense by about 10 million in 2019 additionally fourth quarter personnel costs were elevated in part due to increase profit sharing expense given popular s improved performance which totaled 17 5 million for the fourth quarter and 25 5 million in total for 2018 fourth quarter expense numbers also include the previously announced 12 5 million expense for the early termination of popular s 450 million 7 notes due 2019 approximately 12 million of expenses are related to having the full quarter of reliable operations under popular business promotion costs were higher in the fourth quarter and reflect the traditional seasonality of this expense line finally oreo expenses improved compared to last quarter due to incremental reimbursements on hurricane insurance claims and a gain on sale of certain property if we adjust the fourth quarter expenses for the following four items one the 19 5 million for the retirement program two 17 5 million for the profit sharing plan three 12 5 million for the early extinguishment of debt and lastly 11 7 million of reliable expenses adjusted fourth quarter expenses will be approximately 335 million which is in line with our most recent guidance advertisement advertisement for 2019 the expected normalization of oreo expenses resulting from a return to normal foreclosure activity and a full year of reliable operations will add approximately 40 million to popular s expense base higher pension technology regulatory and personnel costs are expected to result in average quarterly expenses for year 2019 of approximately 364 million on december 10 2018 the governor of puerto rico signed into law the puerto rico tax reform which among other things reduce the corporate income tax rate from 39 to 37 5 as a result in the fourth quarter popular recognized a non cash income tax expense of 27 7 million as the reduced tax rate required we adjust the net dta of our puerto rico operation our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter excluding the dta valuation expense was approximately 30 this is higher than in the third quarter and higher than our prior guidance as more income was recognized at the 39 marginal tax rate in puerto rico in addition due to popular s tax position the debt extinguishment expenses are not subject to a tax benefit in 2019 we expect our tax rate to be in a range of 22 to 25 please turn to slide 7 our capital levels remained strong related to peer banks as well as with respect to well capitalized regulatory requirements in the fourth quarter we completed our previously announced 125 million buyback through an accelerated stock repurchase program as ignacio mentioned at the start of today s call subject to the approval of our board of directors our 2019 capital plan includes two actions first an increase of popular s quarterly common dividend by 0 05 to 0 30 per share which we expect to implement for the distribution of our next quarterly dividend and secondly we will be implementing a common stock repurchase program of 250 million while our last two buyback programs have been executed via asrs the detailed implementation plan of this buyback is still in the designing stage tangible book value in the quarter was 46 90 up from 44 62 last quarter due to a decrease in unrealized losses in our investment portfolio and our earnings for the quarter offset by common and preferred stock dividends our common equity tier 1 ratio was 16 9 up from 16 2 on the effects of the reliable acquisition capital actions dividends on our quarterly results we will continue to pursue our target of maintaining and improving our double digit return on tangible equity while keeping capital levels are appropriate for popular s risk profile with that i d turn the call over to lidio lidio soriano executive vice president and chief risk officer thank you carlos and good morning in puerto rico we continue to experience normalization of our credit quality results after hurricanes irma and maria last year excluding commercial net charge offs credit quality metrics are better or near pre storm levels in our consumer portfolio excluding the reliable transaction early delinquency on non performing loans are below pre hurricane levels the consumer net charge off ratio for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 2 11 also below pre storm levels in the mortgage portfolio total delinquency continued to improve with early delinquencies a level significantly better from those prior to the hurricanes while npl decreased by 20 million 25 million quarter over quarter reaching 224 million mortgages charge offs were 1 14 similar to level levels prior to the storms in commercial lending net charge off increased by 49 million compared to the prior quarter the increase in net charge offs was due a specific relationship one is a problem loan acquired from westernbank which we have been working out for some time and for which the charge off was reserved in prior period the other relationship is a commercial real estate loan for which the hurricanes and increases interest rate risk have impacted its ability to service its debt as originally contracted our puerto rico non owner occupied cre portfolio is 2 28 billion of which roughly 750 million is variable rate we have inaudible underwriting our customers ability to service their debt and concluded that none of our remaining variable cre portfolio are of significance and any potential future impact has been included as part of the environmental factor component of our allowance for loan losses in the fourth quarter in the us our credit results remained solid with favorable credit quality metrics please turn to slide number 9 at quarter end our outstanding direct exposure to the puerto rico government municipalities and other municipalities was 458 million flat from the prior quarter popular does not own any debt issued at puerto rico central government or its public corporations our municipality exposure consists mainly of senior priority loans to a select group of municipalities whose revenues are largely independent of the central government in most cases the good faith credit and unlimited taxing power of each municipality is pledged to repayment of the loans 75 of our exposure are to the four largest municipalities in the san juan metro area we also have indirect lending facility in which the government acts as a guarantor the largest such exposure is in the form of residential mortgage loans to individual borrowers in which the government provides a guarantee similar to associate programs in the us turn to slide number 9 to discuss credit metrics for the quarter non performing assets decreased by 18 million to 748 million this quarter driven by non performing loan decrease of 21 million offset in part by marginal increase of 3 million the decreasing npls was driven by lower puerto rico mortgage npls of 25 million and us construction npls of 6 million offset in part by an increase of 12 million in puerto rico commercial npls at the end of the fourth quarter the ratio of npls to total loans helping portfolio decreased slightly 2 3 from 2 4 in the prior quarter the increasing oreo was mainly in puerto rico due to the resumption of foreclosure activities please turn to slide number 10 to discuss npl inflows the npl story is positive so i ll be brief influx of npls were flat quarter over quarter puerto rico mortgage inflows for the quarter remains significantly better than the pre hurricane levels primarily due to lower early delinquencies post moratorium turning to slide number 11 net charge offs amounted to 107 million or an annualized 1 63 ph of average loans held in portfolio compared to 64 million or 1 in the third quarter the increase of 43 million from the prior quarter was mainly driven by higher puerto rico commercial net charge off of 49 this increase was in part offset by lower consumer net charge off of 6 million and lower mortgage net charge off of 4 million net charge off in the us increased by 7 million the corporation s allowance for loan losses decreased by 64 million from the prior quarter to 569 million mainly driven by a decrease of 53 million in puerto rico due to one large relationship previously reserved for coupled with improvement in the loss estimates of the purchase crediting per portfolio improving loss trends in our consumer portfolio and lower european reserves last year hurricane reserve has been mostly reallocated utilized or reserved the us segment s allowance for loan losses decreased by 11 million mostly related to construction relationship charge offs during the quarter the provision for loan losses decreased to 43 million from 54 million in the prior quarter reaching pre hurricane levels the decrease of 11 million was mainly in puerto rico due to the continued improvements in credit metrics after this hurricane to summarize the credit quality results for the fourth quarter were favorable with continued strength in the us and metrics are close to or better than pre hurricane levels in puerto rico with that i would like to turn the call over to ignacio for his concluding remarks thank you ignacio alvarez president and chief executive officer thank you lidio and carlos for your updates the year 2018 which marked our 125th anniversary was a strong one for popular we achieved solid financial results and accomplished important milestones the new planned capital actions announced today reflect that strength we begin 2019 on a solid footing and excited about our prospects for the year please turn to slide 12 we continue to improve our leading market position in puerto rico which puts us in a strong position to take advantage of future opportunities as well as to effectively manage challenges that may arise banco popular s franchise is unique having consistently

the island our growth initiatives in united states have good traction and we expect to see further progress finally we have additional sources of value such as our investments in evertec and bhd which continue to contribute to earnings and represent unrecognized investment value we are energized and determined to make good use of this positive momentum to continue delivering solid results and to drive shareholder value we are now ready to answer your questions questions and answers operator we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions and our first question comes from alex twerdahl of sandler o neill please go ahead alex twerdahl sandler o neill analyst hey good morning guys ignacio alvarez president and chief executive officer good morning carlos vazquez executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning alex twerdahl sandler o neill analyst i want to first drill into your deposit base and just ask a couple of questions that i think people are interested in one is what is the current level of government deposits that you guys have versus customer deposits and what kind of have been the flows during the fourth quarter of sort of your core deposit base versus the government deposits carlos vazquez executive vice president and chief financial officer yes alex hi this is carlos our public deposits are around 8 billion right now and they were slightly down in the fourth quarter they haven t changed that much for the last couple of quarters alex twerdahl sandler o neill analyst okay and then as you kind of talk about the 9 billion of emergency funds that have come in 2018 and the 13 billion that are expected for 2019 do you have any more clarity today on core ph so how that might impact popular s balance sheet and p l how much of it might actually flow through the bank whether it s directly indirectly per share really et cetera ignacio alvarez president and chief executive officer well this is ignacio i mean we have a nearly 50 market share so the money that flow to puerto rico is a good chance that they re flowing through it one way or the other it s hard for us to predict exactly how that s going to happen obviously the greater the amount of local involvement in the recovery effort the better it is for us so that s an important factor alex twerdahl sandler o neill analyst okay so to be determined and then i just had a sort of a question about toward the end of last year there was a bunch of press about the qualified opportunity zones and how it potentially could impact puerto rico disproportionately just given how much of the island is qualified have you seen any investments come down to the island yet or heard much talk about investments being made under that particular program ignacio alvarez president and chief executive officer i haven t seen an investment but there has been a number of opportunities i mean a number of people were talking about the opportunity there s been a number of conferences a number of investors coming to puerto rico yesterday i met someone from the construction industry who said they re working on three real projects that would involve opportunity fund so there i think we haven t seen a specific project to date but there is a number of people that are looking into it so we re still relatively optimistic that it s going to have a good impact on puerto rico how much we don t know for sure but there is a lot of interest in the subject still alex twerdahl sandler o neill analyst okay that s helpful and then just finally carlos the purchase accounting accretion from the reliable deal i think it was 16 2 million in the fourth quarter how should we be thinking about modeling that over the next several years carlos vazquez executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean the i think the balance we have left is about 82 million right now alex i think a large portion of the part of that had to do with the commercial portfolio is probably gone now so most of what s left is probably consumer portfolio and those loans have an average life of about three years so if you straight line that in 2 5 years you re probably in the right ballpark alex twerdahl sandler o neill analyst great thanks for taking my questions carlos vazquez executive vice president and chief financial officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from brett rabatin of piper jaffray please go ahead brett rabatin piper jaffray analyst hey good morning guys ignacio alvarez president and chief executive officer good morning brett carlos vazquez executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning brett rabatin piper jaffray analyst i wanted to go back to deposits and ask the increase in the ending period the non spent ph dta at the end of the year versus average for the quarter is that sticky and kind of how do you think about managing the liquidity and obviously the government deposits go down eventually but how are you guys thinking about managing liquidity this year and then any thoughts on that ending period dta growth ignacio alvarez president and chief executive officer i mean the first thing as you mentioned we have been saying for a while that we expect public deposits to trend down they haven t yet but they will eventually when that happens it doesn t really affect liquidity because all public deposit in puerto rico need to be collateralized so when and if that happens we get our collateral back and we can either sell it redeploy it or do whatever we want with it most of the other deposit lines continue to be pretty steady the one that had the most positive change this quarter was actually commercial so that was the bigger contributor this quarter it does it s a little bit but it does change from category to category but in general we still feel that the deposit business is pretty strong we have an ample amount of liquidity so we try to manage it smartly but liquidity is not a concern that is high in our list right now brett rabatin piper jaffray analyst okay and in i m thinking about the loan portfolio this year you re looking for growth in the us and puerto rico flat and that was somewhat the trend in 4q but puerto rico was once down a little bit can you maybe give us some color on just thinking about puerto rico being flat this year are the lending opportunities not significant enough and for the year modeling to offset payoffs and i don t know payoffs are bigger issue this year or what can you maybe carlos vazquez executive vice president and chief financial officer a couple of things first as ignacio mentioned brett there s a lot of activity going on but what we haven t and we re closing loans every day we just haven t seen the rate of new loans exceed that the rate of pay downs and payoffs do remember that our westernbank portfolio our western portfolio is a decaying portfolio that runs out it probably was about 100 million in the fourth quarter so that means that the rest of the business grew as we mentioned we had a strong auto segment in puerto rico as well in the fourth quarter the overall loan balance does get affected brett by the fannie mae portfolio we service because when those become delinquent we had to report them in our loan balances even though we haven t repurchased those loans yet and in the fourth quarter that was a reduction in about 60 million okay so there is some variability there again we are hopeful as ignacio mentioned that we will see some loan growth in puerto rico but we are stopping short of calling it until we see it and we haven t seen it yet brett rabatin piper jaffray analyst okay that s good color and then maybe just one last housekeeping would you guys have the dollar amount of client transactions for debit credit in the quarter carlos vazquez executive vice president and chief financial officer hold on i think we do just give us a second to flip through our papers give me a second okay in the fourth quarter this is the dollar amount in the fourth quarter of transactions was 3 71 billion brett rabatin piper jaffray analyst okay carlos vazquez executive vice president and chief financial officer or 3 51 billion in the prior quarter brett rabatin piper jaffray analyst okay great thank you so much carlos vazquez executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator our next question comes from gerard cassidy of rbc capital markets please go ahead steven duong rbc capital markets analyst hi guys this is actually steve dialing in for gerard thanks for taking our call carlos vazquez executive vice president and chief financial officer hey steve how are you steven duong rbc capital markets analyst hey so just on your capital return you guys announced the capital actions for 2019 should we assume that this is pretty much it for the year or is there are there any other opportunities for further capital actions later in the year carlos vazquez executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean i think assuming this is pretty much it for the year is the right assumption there is no regulatory restriction that will keep us from trying to do something else but the truth of the matter is that the process we have followed over the last three years has proven to be very successful in keeping us moving in the right direction when we think we have the best and most information so our regulators can do their best analysis on our request is toward the second half of the year so i would suggest that any the best assumption right now is that the next capital action announcement will follow the same trend and the same story we ve followed and timing we followed over the last three years again which we work on in the second half of the year we hopefully are ready to make an announcement in the first quarter or next year the only exception to that over the last four years obviously was the hurricane season steven duong rbc capital markets analyst great thanks for that and just back on capital here so your stock price has bucked the trend last year relative to other banks and you guys are still on a sizable level of capital do you guys see acquisitions taking more prominence in your capital deployment strategy now and are you seeing any acquisition opportunities ignacio alvarez president and chief executive officer this is ignacio i think we always look at opportunities that are presented to us but as you know in the last few years they ve been very expensive and we re cautious about the economic environment in the us for the next couple of years so while yes we ll look at everything that s out there we re going to be we re going to be cautious carlos vazquez executive vice president and chief financial officer and remind you that we will we cannot do an acquisition on deposits in puerto rico we can buy we can buy banking assets in puerto rico but not deposits steven duong rbc capital markets analyst right great appreciate it thanks guys operator our next question comes from glen manna of keefe bruyette woods please go ahead glen manna keefe bruyette woods analyst hi good morning guys ignacio alvarez president and chief executive officer good morning carlos vazquez executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning glen glen manna keefe bruyette woods analyst this question i guess is for lidio lidio the two commercial relationships that you took the nco for in puerto rico were those charged off against the special hurricane provision that you took last year and how much of that provision is kind of left lidio soriano executive vice president and chief risk officer i think i mentioned in my prepared remarks that we are for the most part in which have been brought into a regular provision for the reserve that we have related to the hurricanes so none of it is most of it is out of this quarter in terms of whether the two cases are that we cited were part of the hurricane reserved they were not they were this was some specific cases in which there was no reserves from the hurricanes glen manna keefe bruyette woods analyst okay thank you and on the 250 million repurchase in the past you guys have chosen to do an asr is there any reason why we should assume that you kind of wouldn t follow that path again this year ignacio alvarez president and chief executive officer we just started the analysis in while we have done two asrs consecutively glen we have every time we actually have sat down and gone through an analysis what we think is the best path of action we will do the same this time and we don t have a plan yet so yes we ve done that for last couple of times we may do that again but at this point in time we haven t reached any decision glen manna keefe bruyette woods analyst okay thanks guys ignacio alvarez president and chief executive officer appreciate it operator our next question comes from ken zerbe of morgan stanley please go ahead ken zerbe morgan stanley analyst hey thanks ignacio alvarez president and chief executive officer hi ken ken zerbe morgan stanley analyst just in terms of fee income line hello just i know we need to back out the it sound like the 9 5 million of hurricane related recoveries probably won t continue in first quarter if we take that and sort of back out other possible adjustments like the fair value msr what s the right level for fee income kind of as we think on a quarterly basis we think about 2019 carlos vazquez executive vice president and chief financial officer i mean i think other than those two things the quarter was pretty normal quarter so you just did the calculation i think ken ken zerbe morgan stanley analyst got you okay so like mid 130s or so carlos vazquez executive vice president and chief financial officer level like it ken zerbe morgan stanley analyst okay all right perfect thank you carlos vazquez executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator our next question comes from scott valentin of compass point please go ahead scott valentin compass point research analyst good morning thanks for taking my question just carlos vazquez executive vice president and chief financial officer hi scott how are you scott valentin compass point research analyst doing well with regard to margin i mean this quarter you had some i guess a 10 basis point benefit from the prepayment and then also the fourth quarter of reliable but how should we think about the margin going forward i know you guys have an asset sensitive balance sheet outlook as the fed is not going raise rates as fast that s the outlook today that changes day to day but just wondering what the outlook for the margin is as we think about a core margin maybe of 4 15 ph in that range given the 10 basis point benefit this quarter is that a fair way to look at it then probably mostly stable going forward carlos vazquez executive vice president and chief financial officer i mean we had an increase in rates in december that you haven t seen the effect of that yet and that will flow through moving forward i think reliable is all in now so other than that i think those are the two effects are left so ignacio alvarez president and chief executive officer the one thing we would correct the prepayment i m assuming you mean the commercial loan that paid off that had a benefit there s always things in that line that go back and forth i would give that a minimal maybe 2 basis points to 3 basis points all in so i think the run rate for the quarter is fairly reasonable scott valentin compass point research analyst okay thanks that s helpful and then just on the one credit i guess the two commercial credits the one credit you mentioned was fully reserved the second credit i think you said about the commercial real estate loan was that fully reserved or was there any reserve against that prior to the charge off and then maybe you can give maybe some color on the industry it was in lidio soriano executive vice president and chief risk officer on non occupied cre there was no reserve prior to the action that we took this quarter scott valentin compass point research analyst okay thanks and then just on the return on capital looking i know the regulators obviously you to deal with the regulators and we don t have that insight to the discussions there but it seems like with the cet1 ratio you guys have a very high very profitable credit s getting better i mean going forward do you see that the incremental process where assuming the outlook for puerto rico is still pretty positive that the incremental capital returns keep increasing going forward is that kind of the way you guys are thinking about it ignacio alvarez president and chief executive officer we ve been successful so far incrementing the capital returns and having the regulators be comfortable with our position so we ll get the same path i mean we doubled the common stock repurchase and we increased the dividend at the same time and i think that reflects the progress we ve made in convincing our regulators of the strength of our financial position carlos vazquez executive vice president and chief financial officer i mean we continue to track our peers and hopefully we will continue to do that toward sometimes they see the one interesting thing that we and all our peers will have to deal with is the effects of cecl which everybody is working on right now and those details will start coming out probably later this year as all of us start put our all our new models into implementation but in general we you re correct that we have a strong capital base we hope to continue to track the trend of our mainland peers scott valentin compass point research analyst thanks very much carlos vazquez executive vice president and chief financial officer you re welcome operator operator instructions our next question comes from bob napoli of william blair please go ahead robert napoli william blair analyst thank you just wanted to follow up on the consumer spending trends in puerto rico that you re seeing i mean i think you said spending was up 22 year over year for credit and debit card spending what were the trends as you exited the year on a year over year basis in january do you with the changes in government and relief funding and obviously a lot of rebuild going on do you expect to have decent growth in 2019 in credit and debit card spending ignacio alvarez president and chief executive officer well it s too early to tell january because we re still in the month but we ve in generally puerto rico economy is going steady it s not i don t think it s going to grow as fast as the fiscal board predicted obviously at the beginning of the term because the federal funds have come in much slower than expected but i view it almost as a positive we ve had positive growth notwithstanding the fact the funds have come in slower so we i m not sure we ll see the double digit increase year over year that we ve seen but we expect it to be a steady pace robert napoli william blair analyst and as you exited the year do you have that like the growth rate i think it was 18 through august obviously the comps got a lot easier in september and october but ignacio alvarez president and chief executive officer for the full year it was it grew by 22 so it was 18 in august for the full year it was 22 robert napoli william blair analyst right yeah carlos vazquez executive vice president and chief financial officer there is remember the inaudible robert napoli william blair analyst and is there anything going on secularly that you re seeing as far as electronic payments versus cash payments ignacio alvarez president and chief executive officer no not really no carlos vazquez executive vice president and chief financial officer the trends continue more of our clients use electronic transactions every quarter and that trend is continuing i think as ignacio reported ignacio alvarez president and chief executive officer on the deposit side and on the payment side in puerto rico ath mobile has been it s continuously growing at a fast pace but there s nothing dramatically changed robert napoli william blair analyst great thank you very much appreciate it operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference over to ignacio alvarez ceo for any closing remarks ignacio alvarez president and chief executive officer yes thank

graph 3 shows the significant growth in total bank and securitisation loan net transactions new loan issuance less repayments in the 10 years before the gfc this growth was related to financial liberalisation in australia from the early 1990s plus lower interest rates and inflation making it cheaper to borrow the growth in on market securitisation was driven by relatively high mortgage interest rates relative to capital market interest rates making funding of mortgage lending in the wholesale market quite profitable just prior to the gfc in the june quarter 2007 total loan net transactions was 78 0b with banks and on market securitisers contributing 50 2b and 27 7b respectively as the gfc hit there were impacts on the on market securitiser loan market graph 3 with negative net loan transactions where repayments were larger than new loan issuance from september quarter 2007 through to march quarter 2011 there were significant net loan repayments in the december quarter 2007 and from the june quarter 2008 to december 2009 the main factor driving negative growth in securitised loan assets was the oversupply of rmbs in the wholesale markets prior to the crisis well over half of australian rmbs were bought by offshore investors with the onset of the gfc reduced demand from overseas investors resulted in a sell off of the rmbs into the domestic market as overseas investors liquidated their portfolios as a result cost of purchase of these securities was prohibitive to make new issuance of securities economic soon after the gfc the commonwealth government implemented a policy to support competition in the residential mortgage market by purchasing new rmbs issues within the on market securitisation market by december quarter 2011 the investment was nearly 12 0b in the last three years the commonwealth government has been gradually divesting the rmbs as the on market securitiser market began to recover from mid 2017 the on market securitisation market has seen some resurgence of loan asset issuance coming through from non bank securitisers graph 3 shows that overall the banks loan market including the internal securitised market significantly slowed during the gfc this reflected difficult credit conditions in the global wholesale markets cautious behaviour by households slowed economic activity and stronger lending standards bank loan market growth picked up in 2010 reflecting ongoing strength in deposit funding for lending and less reliance on wholesale funding it slowed down again in 2011 12 reflecting deleveraging behaviour by households and business and also business moving more towards wholesale markets for their funding from late 2012 there was significant growth in the bank loan market with a peak of 71 6b in march quarter 2015 reflecting the large demand in the housing market due to low interest rates along with increasing house prices and high levels of investor demand within the housing market since then there has been an overall slowdown up to september quarter 2018 with some volatility this coincides with tighter lending standards with investor housing slowing in particular in 2018 collateral requirements for higher density residential projects and other commercial property development and banks reduced exposures to resource related businesses graph 3 shows the net positive transactions of the internal securitised loans evident during the gfc as banks obtained funds from the rba repurchase agreement program internal securitisation remained subdued from 2009 until the sovereign debt crisis in europe in 2011 where transactions in internal securitisation can be observed as banks prepared for the deterioration in the credit markets and planned to have rmbs ready for future transaction in the repurchase lending program with the rba around the same time apra announced the introduction of the committed liquidity facility clf in response to basel iii liquidity reform requirements which came into affect on the 1st of january 2015 the clf ensures that participating banks have enough access to liquidity to respond to an acute stress scenario to meet the regulatory requirements set by authorities the internal securitisation market of banks increased significantly up until 2015 when the clf was introduced

42 respectively fourth quarter 2017 return on average assets and return on average equity were 0 16 and 1 40 respectively during the fourth quarter of 2017 first bank recognized a one time charge to income tax expense of approximately 2 6 million or 0 15 per diluted share as a result of the federal tax legislation that lowered corporate statutory income tax rates requiring a revaluation of first bank s deferred tax assets net income for the fourth quarter 2018 and 2017 included certain merger related items first bank s fourth quarter 2018 adjusted diluted earnings per share1 were 0 21

12 9 million for the prior year quarter and total net revenue for 2018 of 58 4 million an increase of 39 8 or 16 6 million compared to 2017 total loans of 1 46 billion at december 31 2018 an increase of 235 1 million or 19 2 from 1 23 billion on december 31 2017 which included 178 0 million of organic loan growth total deposits of 1 4 billion at 2018 year end increased by 226 1 million or 19 4 from 1 2 billion at december 31 2017 which included 117 9 million of organic deposit growth continued strong asset quality metrics with net loan charge offs of 7 000 for fourth quarter 2018 compared to 287 000 for fourth quarter 2017 nonperforming loans to total loans of 0 44 at december 31 2018 compared with 0 52 at september 30 2018 and 0 43 at december 31 2017 driven by strong average interest earning asset growth of 365 3 million in 2018 and the resulting increase in interest and dividend income first bank recorded another solid and productive performance for the fourth quarter and full year said patrick l ryan president and chief executive officer our top line revenue growth for the year continued at a double digit pace and flowed through to strong earnings improvement reflective of both enhanced operating performance and a lower federal tax rate average loans grew 343 0 million up 33 5 from 2017 from a combination of acquisition and strong organic origination activity average deposits were up 299 2 million at december 31 2018 also reflecting acquisition activity as well as actions taken targeted to attract new or enhanced deposit relationships our increased non interest expense for 2018 reflects a full year of additional expenses associated with our acquisition of bucks county bank in september 2017 and our second quarter addition of delanco bancorp as well as investments in people and technology to support our growing franchise examples of these investments include the addition of a chief deposit officer and additional members of our retail and commercial deposit teams in the fourth quarter of 2018 to build on the progress we have made toward becoming a strong deposit gatherer despite the increase in non interest expense for the year we continued to benefit from operating leverage with total revenue growth of 43 compared to the 35 increase in non interest expense our fourth quarter net interest margin of 3 44 was down 7 basis points compared to fourth quarter 2017 and our 2018 net interest margin of 3 57 improved 18 basis points compared to the prior year margin compression continues to be a challenge that we intend to manage by focusing on opportunities for higher interest rates for interest earning assets and by remaining disciplined in pricing deposits our asset quality metrics were highly favorable throughout 2018 including the fourth quarter even while we continued to experience significant loan growth after two reporting periods where we had net recoveries our net charge offs for the fourth quarter were de minimis at 7 000 and nonperforming loans to total loans finished the year at 0 44 only 1 basis point higher than the ratio at 2017 year end as the flattening yield curve has generated margin pressure we continue to vigorously explore expense management in october we consolidated our bensalem location into the nearby trevose branch to improve the efficiency of our service footprint in eastern pennsylvania we continue to evaluate the effectiveness of our branch system and in march 2019 we plan to further consolidate the former bucks county bank location in levittown into our trevose location 2018 was another productive and successful year for first bank and we believe that we re well positioned to continue this trend in 2019 we begin the new year with a solid loan pipeline continued favorable asset quality metrics and a strong capital position from which to fund continued loan growth income statement our net interest income for fourth quarter 2018 was 14 2 million an increase of 1 9 million or 15 5 compared to 12 3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 this growth was driven by a 3 9 million or 24 7 increase in interest and dividend income this increase was primarily a result of a 239 6 million increase in average loan balances with growth in all of our loan types along with an 18 basis point increase in the average interest rate on loans compared with the fourth quarter of 2017 interest income growth was offset somewhat by increased interest expense of 2 0 million for the comparable quarter which was primarily a result of higher average balances and interest rates paid for time deposits and money market deposits both loan and deposit balances reflect acquired and organic growth activity net interest income of 54 9 million for 2018 increased by 15 3 million or 38 5 compared to 39 7 million for 2017 the increase in 2018 net interest income was also primarily driven by significant growth in average loans which increased by 343 0 million along with a 30 basis point increase in the average interest rate on loans compared to the prior year partially offset by higher interest expense on interest bearing deposits due to higher average balances and rates paid the fourth quarter 2018 tax equivalent net interest margin was 3 44 a decrease of 7 basis points compared to 3 51 for the prior year quarter and a decrease of 16 basis points from the linked third quarter 2018 the decrease in the fourth quarter margin compared to 2017 was primarily the result of higher average balances and rates paid for interest bearing liabilities primarily money market and time deposits interest bearing liability costs increased 39 basis points for the comparable quarters partially offsetting higher interest bearing liability costs was the increase in the yield on interest earning assets which increased 26 basis points primarily driven by an increase of 18 basis points on the average yield on loans our tax equivalent margin for the third quarter 2018 of 3 60 included the realization of 447 000 in interest income resulting from the payoff of a large nonaccrual commercial loan which contributed approximately 11 basis points to the margin absent this item our fourth quarter margin would have been 5 basis points lower compared to the third quarter due primarily to higher rates paid on money market and time deposits which contributed to a 13 basis point increase in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities the net interest margin for 2018 was 3 57 an increase of 18 basis points compared to 3 39 for the prior year the improvement in the full year net interest margin was driven by a 365 3 million increase in average interest earning assets primarily loans along with a 36 basis point increase in the average rate for interest earning assets compared to 2017 during 2018 the federal reserve increased the federal funds rate four times first bank s loan portfolio yield increased 30 basis points primarily due to the repricing of floating rate loans partially offsetting higher earning asset yields were higher average interest bearing liability balances and rates paid due to a rising rate environment the provision for loan losses for the fourth quarter 2018 totaled 1 0 million an increase of 311 000 compared to 715 000 for the fourth quarter 2017 and an increase of 305 000 compared to the linked third quarter 2018 the full year 2018 provision for loan losses was 3 4 million compared to 2 7 million for the prior year period the increase in the provision amount for the quarter and for the full year was a result of continued solid organic growth in our commercial loan portfolio along with a specific reserve for a single nonperforming commercial loan the increase was partially offset by continued low net charge offs and strong asset quality metrics fourth quarter 2018 non interest income increased 380 000 to 984 000 from 604 000 in the fourth quarter of 2017 the increase was primarily a result of higher gains on recovery of acquired loans gains on sale of loans and income from bank owned life insurance non interest income totaled 3 5 million for 2018 an increase of 1 3 million compared to 2 1 million for 2017 the increase was primarily a result of higher gains on recovery of acquired loans higher other non interest income and income from bank owned life insurance non interest expense for fourth quarter 2018 totaled 9 2 million an increase of 1 9 million compared to 7 2 million for the prior year quarter and an increase of 976 000 compared to the third quarter of 2018 the higher non interest expense compared to fourth quarter 2017 was primarily a result of increased salaries and employee benefits expense higher occupancy and equipment costs and other expense these higher expenses were partially offset by a reduction in merger related expenses and other real estate owned expense net non interest expense in 2018 was higher in part due to the acquisition of delanco in the second quarter of 2018 primarily reflected in higher salaries and occupancy and equipment costs the increase in the fourth quarter compared to the linked third quarter was mainly the result of salary related expenses including the hiring of our chief deposit officer and additional staffing for our retail and commercial deposit teams we also incurred additional depreciation related costs associated with the upcoming closure of our levittown branch in the first quarter of 2019 non interest expense for 2018 totaled 33 3 million an increase of 8 6 million or 35 compared to 24 7 million for 2017 the 2018 increase in non interest expense over 2017 was also primarily a result of increased salaries and employee benefits expense and higher occupancy and equipment expense largely the result of our recent acquisitions and other expense associated with a growing bank partially offset by lower merger related and other real estate owned expenses our efficiency ratio2 for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 61 8 compared to 54 8 in the fourth quarter of 2017 the efficiency ratio was relatively stable for the year despite the increase in the fourth quarter of 2018 the efficiency ratio was affected in the fourth quarter of 2018 by a modestly declining net interest margin higher salary related expenses and the one time depreciation increase related to the levittown branch closure absent unusual items in the first quarter of 2019 we anticipate that our efficiency ratio will be more in line with our recent historical levels pre provision net revenue3 for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 5 7 million a decrease of 91 000 compared to 5 8 million for the fourth quarter 2017 similar to the efficiency ratio pre provision net revenue was also impacted by a lower net interest margin higher salary related expense and the additional levittown depreciation expense noted previously similar to our efficiency ratio we anticipate that our pre provision net revenue will improve in the first quarter of 2019 income tax expense for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 823 000 or an effective tax rate of 16 7 compared to 4 3 million or an effective tax rate of 88 1 in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 1 4 million or an effective tax rate of 20 2 in the linked third quarter 2018 as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act that was enacted on december 22 2017 first bank revalued its deferred tax assets to account for the future impact of a significantly lower corporate income tax rate based on this analysis first bank recorded a one time charge of 2 6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily related to the revaluation of the deferred tax assets excluding the effects of this one time charge the effective tax rate for fourth quarter 2017 would have been 33 7 the effective tax rate for the full year 2018 and 2017 was 18 7 and 51 5 respectively the reduction in the effective tax rate for the full year and quarter ended december 2018 was primarily a result of the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act in 2017 which reduced the federal statutory corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 the reduction in the fourth quarter effective tax rate compared to the linked third quarter is attributable to the tax benefit received related to additional options exercised in the fourth quarter of 2018 as well as lower than expected state income tax as a result of state tax strategies on july 1 2018 new jersey passed new tax legislation which imposes a surtax on corporations beginning on or after january 1 2018 in addition the new law reduced the dividends received deduction for certain dividend income retroactive to january 1 2017 another aspect of the law that could impact first bank is the adoption of combined tax filings for corporations that are part of an affiliated group beginning in 2019 the surtax and the reduction in the dividends received deduction had a minimal impact to our 2018 income tax expense and effective tax rate we are continuing to assess the potential impact of the change to the state tax regulations in 2019 with our advisors we believe at this time our state tax planning strategies will continue to be beneficial in 2019 and our effective tax rate will be approximately 21 as we enter 2019 if certain state tax strategies are curtailed with the new regulations we currently estimate that it will result in an effective tax rate of approximately 28 in 2019 balance sheet total assets at december 31 2018 were 1 71 billion an increase of 258 8 million or 17 8 compared to 1 45 billion at december 31 2017 due primarily to loan growth both organic and acquired total loans were 1 46 billion at december 31 2018 an increase of 235 1 million or 19 2 compared to 1 23 billion at the 2017 year end loan growth during 2018 was distributed across commercial and consumer loan segments and included both originated and acquired loans the acquired delanco loan portfolio contributed 57 1 million to the 2018 loan growth total deposits were 1 4 billion at december 31 2018 an increase of 226 1 million or 19 4 compared to 1 2 billion at december 31 2017 non interest bearing deposits totaled 219 0 million at december 31 2018 an increase of 20 4 million or 10 3 from december 31 2017 the delanco acquisition added 108 2 million of deposits at the time of acquisition stockholders equity increased to 194 8 million at december 31 2018 up 31 6 million or 19 3 compared to 163 3 million at december 31 2017 the increase was primarily the result of a 15 5 million increase in retained earnings along with the bank s issuance of additional common shares for the acquisition of delanco which increased capital by 14 4 million asset quality first bank s asset quality metrics were stable and favorable throughout 2018 reflective of our ongoing disciplined risk management and underwriting standards net charge offs for the fourth quarter were 7 000 compared to 287 000 for fourth quarter 2017 and net recoveries of 103 000 for the linked third quarter of 2018 net charge offs

this article is part of the reshaping european democracy project an initiative of carnegie s democracy conflict and governance program and carnegie europe most debates about democracy in the eu overlook a crucial dimension of reform democratizing the global workplace the eu s reform agenda must focus on the underlying political economy of democratic participation a social blind spot since the 2008 2009 economic crisis many europeans have asked whether the eu can deal with economic shocks in a democratic way and whether this response will avoid undermining social policies and protections that benefit the majority of the population the interventions by the troika the european central bank the european commission and the imf into the greek economy as part of the european response to the sovereign debt crisis have left serious doubts that either of these questions will receive a positive response the troika attacked collective bargaining agreements in the private sector and imposed drastic pay cuts in the public sector many european citizens perceived these moves as well as the various memoranda and economic adjustment programs as undemocratically imposed greece may have exited the adjustment program in august 2018 but its experience weighs heavily in the minds of many europeans italy s right wing government has earned popular support for deliberately questioning the european commission s budget guidelines in the name of addressing poverty this shows how skeptical many europeans are about the eu s commitment to social welfare and democracy and it is precisely this skepticism the italian right wing is using to provoke a conflict and further undermine the commission s popular legitimacy such an approach has support beyond southern europe and if the commission does not reconsider it will find itself increasingly vulnerable to popular backlash starting in 2015 the european commission attempted to demonstrate its social awareness by resuscitating the long dormant social pillar of the european union the european pillar of social rights was signed by european leaders in 2017 while the document has no legal force it seeks to better implement existing european law by detailing twenty social rights and principles they cover equal opportunities and access to the labour market fair working conditions and social protection and inclusion the rights and principles are almost exclusively individual with collective bargaining only weakly mentioned in terms of social dialogue there have been other social initiatives led by the commission the recently completed revision of the posted workers directive which notably ensures that posted workers that is workers temporarily laboring outside of their own country benefit from collective agreements the european labour authority announced by european commission president jean claude juncker in his 2017 state of the union address to promote the spread of information coordination and dispute mediation across borders in the single market and programs on work life balance and workplace conditions niccolò milanese niccolò milanese is director of european alternatives and author of citizens of nowhere how europe can be saved from itself london zed 2018 this renewed emphasis on the social dimension is supposed to be connected to the european semester which is the commission s attempt to bring order to european economic governance thus the commission ranks the member states according to unemployment rates especially youth unemployment reduction in poverty lifelong learning access to childcare and other social indicators yet it does not measure the meaningfulness of work it also fails to assess whether workers have a say over the nature of their work their relationships at work their work s relationship to the greater economy or their working conditions in an age when more and more people classify their work as bullshit jobs to use the provocative phrase from the anthropologist david graeber something important is being missed 1 indeed there is a huge missing link between economic governance and social issues where economic democracy should be democratic economic governance in europe requires more than democratic institutions and procedures 2 furthermore stronger processes of social dialogue and negotiation are needed but also insufficient most importantly deep economic democracy in europe requires accounting for the changes in the nature of work what it does to the european system of political representation and how individual citizens relate to it the eu has not started this debate but research suggests that it will be crucial for addressing threats to democracy and the deep causes of populism structural shifts in political values a developing strand of sociological research studies the relationships between occupations and political outlooks and preferences following groundbreaking work by herbert kitschelt and philippe rehm using the european social survey 3 although sophisticated sociological modeling is required to demonstrate the relationships between occupations and political preferences there is a basic underlying sense that what a person spends most of their time on conditions their political outlooks this is too obvious to be ignored by policymakers in older class based politics which emerged from the industrial revolution and continued with the fordist mode of production governments and elites were aware of this fact and a homogeneous working class could more easily be presupposed indeed the alienation of workers from their work by the industrial mode of production was a central concern not only for karl marx but for all early sociologists trade unionists and socialists traditionally in western european countries at least trade unions and social democratic or socialist parties have provided intermediary bodies in which these issues could be addressed promoting political representation for workers and fostering socialization and cooperation among workers moreover the state itself and in particular the welfare state provides other areas for socialization between doctors and patients for example or between teachers students and parents during the cold war the omnipresence of the state in communist countries made it a primary space for socialization while civil society played a similar role in the west as the structures of production party support and the state are now shifting european democracy needs to develop new ways of reflecting such changes in the pattern of workers social interactions more recently in post industrial economies the membership and political power of trade unions has been declining the socialist and social democratic parties are finding their traditional bases splintering to the populist right and left and the state s capacity to promote open tolerant and democratic values has come under strain no democrat has a long term interest in significant parts of the european population being inadequately represented this deficiency calls into question the legitimacy of the entire system studies on the influence of occupations on political attitudes have made distinctions between technical workers technical experts technicians skilled craft workers and routine industrial and agricultural workers administrative organizational workers managers as well as skilled and unskilled office workers and interpersonal workers sociocultural workers skilled and unskilled service workers 4 technical workers focus on engineering design and development work which deals with considerable uncertainty about cause and effect thus relying on peer review and experimentation interpersonal workers are concerned with the perception development and well being of fellow humans this means they also encounter uncertainty and depend on interpretation only the administrative organizational field privileges authority obedience and domination above other aspects the studies of herbert kitschelt and philippe rehm using the european social survey show that in post industrial economies people involved in administrative organizational occupations tend to have more authoritarian views independent of their income status although those at the top may be less inclined toward redistribution and those at the bottom more inclined those involved in more interpersonal occupations which involve communication and agreement on norms and objectives tend to have more liberal views independent of their income status these axial changes in workers political attitudes cannot be dissociated from the globalizing tendencies that integrate markets while reducing the policy space available for individual governments at the same time multinational corporations play governments off each other to undercut labor rights and protections placing workers in cross border competition if unprecedented numbers of production workers mechanics carpenters assemblers and so on are looking to the populist far right 5 it is not only because of the nature of their work which may be becoming more rigid and impersonal but also because their work experience interacts with their perception of the larger political and economic environment and its insecurities the personal sphere links these workers affinity for authoritarianism to a preference for nationalism it is this nexus of attitudes that europe has a duty to address new forms of workers organization while the economy will continue to require organizational technical and interpersonal workers there are ways of addressing the attitudinal tendencies these occupations promote notably some forms of trade union organizing and cooperative business models can promote interpersonal interactions mutual recognition and norm setting among workers within and among sectors though these models must genuinely promote horizontal interpersonal activity and not reproduce a hierarchical logic moreover the interrelation of changing labor attitudes and globalization suggests that if these initiatives remain nationalized they will fail to address the massive macroeconomic changes under way unless they simply attempt to roll back globalization and break up integrated economies but this extreme scenario would cause massive economic damage and is beyond the power of any individual government or the eu in all probability it is impossible given technological change in the means of production although the current european commission has made social dialogue one of the twenty social rights it only says this dialogue ought to be held according to national practices and has taken no initiative itself previous commissions were more enterprising under jacques delors the commission created european works councils in 1994 which aimed to create transnational institutions to oversee employee participation in multinationals in 2003 romano prodi s commission introduced the legal category of european cooperative society and in 2004 the category of societas europaea set requirements for mandatory negotiations on worker participation at company board level as outlined in the 2001 council directive on employee involvement these initiatives were ambitious in comparison with many member states own efforts and in comparison with the current commission their further development would be desirable for a more democratic economy still it is striking that these initiatives are bureaucratic hierarchical and unresponsive forms of worker representation there is a danger that structures of this type do not promote the kind of self reflexive horizontal collaboration that reinforces open and generous political attitudes moreover it is questionable whether workers in such bureaucratic structures can be as nimble and strategic in crossing borders as their employers perhaps worker led initiatives can inspire different approaches particularly in parts of the economy most exposed to globalization and technological restructuring the annual strikes by amazon workers on black friday and prime day amazon s annual sale which have now happened for four years running are a good example of workers organizing for their political agency the highly alienating disciplinary working conditions in amazon distribution centers are widely documented in 2013 striking german amazon workers realized that their strikes were not as effective as they could be since amazon simply reallocated distribution to centers across the border to poland by 2015 the established german trade union verdi and a new trade union in poland inicjatywa pracowicza partnered whereby workers would strike simultaneously or work slowly in support of the strike across the border now black friday strikes are coordinated in most european countries strikes and other labor actions among food delivery drivers which have spread across the continent demonstrate similar transnational organizing what is more organizing in the gig economy and the new reactive fluid and horizontal trade unions which are being formed in response to the gig economy are often spearheaded by migrant workers and women who are finding agency amid a changing workforce here is perhaps one new example of european integration being led not from the top but horizontally prizing diversity and collaboration the current european commission has rightly targeted multinational corporations for tax avoidance and monopoly behavior the next commission could perhaps consider targeting multinational corporations to improve working conditions pay and the right to organize such actions should be part of a broader strategy to democratize the european economy as a whole from its governance to the ability of individual workers to organize and make decisions together about their work for all the new talk of social dialogue and social rights the overall approach of european economic policy continues to structurally undermine worker representation and gives more rights to companies than to trade unions the viking and laval judgments by the european court of justice in 2007 have become totemic symbols of the tendency to severely restrict the right to collective action and prioritize freedom of establishment for companies concretely this means companies have strong rights to establish themselves in any member state of the single market but workers have limited rights to conduct collective action to influence the practices of these companies reversing this dynamic will require both rethinking how workers representation should function in a globalized economy and finding a new balance between the right of companies to move across borders and the right of workers to organize across borders toward a democratic globalized economy it is no surprise that the european commission has not managed to fully connect economic social and democratic concerns doing so would require the commission to challenge the dogma that economic growth is the basic answer to all social problems to face up to its own role in undermining social cohesion and democracy simultaneously in the many parts of europe that have been exposed to austerity programs and to acknowledge that a technocratic approach exacerbates anti democratic tendencies and sentiments with the upcoming european summit in may 2019 the european parliament elections and the new european commission the union needs a much deeper and more nuanced appreciation of the changing dynamics of the global economy and its implications for political preferences in so doing it should follow the lead set by some of its most politically active working citizens thus in addition to considering a revised framework for protecting the rule of law and introducing a new european values instrument to foster a healthy democracy through civil society organizations the european union should set itself a new mission for democratizing the globalized workplace it has everything to gain by showing it s on the side of workers improving their everyday workplace experience and fostering collaboration with others by doing this the european union would do much to lessen the alienation currently exploited by the populist right if it is too much to expect the entire union to do this given the balance of political forces at the least the party of european socialists needs to help promote economic democracy without borders it would be returning to its original interests

primarily due to a lower gain on sales of small business administration sba loans a lower increase in cash surrender value of life insurance and lower servicing income partially offset by higher service charges and fees on deposit accounts noninterest income increased from 2 2 million for the third quarter of 2018 primarily due to higher termination fees at bay view funding and asset based
