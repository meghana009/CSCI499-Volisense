year end 30 june annual general meeting 16 august 2019 half year results announced august dividend payments at the end of march june september and december company website chairman s statement year to 31 december 2018 dear shareholder during the first quarter of 2018 the uk market suffered a setback which mirrored the us market decline in response to fears of rising inflationary pressures and higher interest rates after which the second quarter showed a slow recovery with the company performing marginally better than the small cap sector as explained in the company s interim report for the period ended 30 june 2018 there was one stock specific issue conviviality plc which went into administration during the second quarter the company made a net profit on the holding but it did impact overall performance the fourth quarter was particularly unforgiving given the global backdrop and is explained more fully in the investment adviser reports investment performance the nav total return of the company s ordinary shares in 2018 was 16 9 whilst this was disappointing the uk market in general and smaller companies in particular suffered under a difficult global macro backdrop and the ongoing uncertainty of a brexit resolution the total return on the ftse all share index and the numis smaller companies ex investment companies index was 9 5 and 15 4 respectively the share price total return was 23 7 reflecting a significant widening of the discount during the year the fall in share price total return comprises two elements a reduction in the value of the assets and a widening of the discount fall in asset value equity markets across the world fell in 2018 for a variety of well documented reasons concerns about the us economy chinese growth slowing and brexit to name but a few in the uk the deadlock over the exit from europe has weighed on equities with the more domestically focussed small companies underperforming the more internationally focussed large caps acorn with unicorn as investment adviser for the smaller companies portfolio invests at the lower end of the market cap range so was particularly impacted the gearing through zero dividend preference shares zdps is a long standing component of the fund which was introduced to enhance returns over the long term however during periods of stress such as that experienced in 2018 it detracts from performance which is why the ordinary share net asset value nav fell by a greater percentage than the decline in total assets the gearing level at the year end was 51 8 the income portfolio which is run by paul smith at premier asset management provides an element of balance to the gearing but does not match it completely widening of the discount during periods of weaker equity markets and domestic uncertainty the discount difference between the value of the assets and the share price on investment trusts can widen during 2018 the discount on the ordinary shares widened from around 5 to over 13 reflecting the market taking a more pessimistic view of uk smaller companies asset allocation coming into 2018 acorn s investment advisers had remained positive on the outlook for the uk smaller companies in which the company is invested and cautious about the outlook for bond markets your board supported these views as a consequence asset allocation at the start of the year was approximately 83 to the smaller companies portfolio and 17 to the income portfolio during a period of equity outperformance the advisers were minded to rebalance during the current year and by year end the weighting was 74 in the smaller companies portfolio and 26 in the income portfolio zero dividend preference shares zdps the number of zdps in issuance is 21 230 989 at the year end the zdps were trading at a 2 1 premium and were 2 4x covered share issuance and buy backs the board continues to monitor the discount and to consider whether further buy backs are an appropriate measure to enhance long term shareholder value the company has power to issue shares at a premium to net asset value and to buy back into treasury or for cancellation at a discount these transactions are generally executed in both classes of share in the correct ratio to maintain the capital structure shares are issued at a premium to the package net asset value the nav of ordinary shares and zdps combined and buy backs at a discount to the package net asset value such that the transaction will always enhance cover for the zdp shares and be nav enhancing for the ordinary shares there were two buy backs during the course of the year in august totalling 100 000 ordinary shares and 134 232 zdp shares undertaken as a measure to stabilise the share price during a period of acute volatility earnings and dividends the first interim dividend for 2018 was increased by 10 and maintaining that quarterly distribution for the rest of the year made a total dividend of 19 80p which represented an increase of 10 on the total dividend for 2017 earnings per share for the year of 21 62p covered the dividend distribution by 109 and resulted in an addition to revenue reserves regulation updates in the markets in financial instruments directive mifid ii became effective on 3 january 2018 one of the main changes introduced by the directive relates to investment research under mifid ii investment managers are only permitted to receive external research from third parties when it is paid for from a separate research payment account rpa managed in accordance with the rules of the financial conduct authority fca mifid ii has not led to a material change in returns or overall costs for the company as our investment advisers had advised the company that they will meet the cost of external investment research in compliance with the new packaged retail and insurance based investment products priips regulations which also came into effect on 3 january 2018 the company has published key information documents kids for the ordinary shares and zdps which can be viewed on the company s website your directors have made a submission in response to the fca s call for input on the priips regulations expressing concerns that the performance risk and cost data contained in kids could be misleading outlook we have very strong belief and confidence in the long term attractions of our investment strategy and confidence in our investment advisers to steer our asset allocation and stock selection pleasingly despite the ongoing domestic uncertainty and broader market nervousness the dividend of the company increased by 10 during 2018 throughout the year the investment advisers have continued to meet the majority of our investee companies on a regular basis and have undertaken a large number of site visits as active managers they continue to assess a number of potential new investment opportunities but remain comfortable with their current portfolios brexit the board has carefully considered the potential impact of brexit on the company we have noted that domestically focused uk smaller companies could be exposed to weaker consumer demand and higher input costs from imported goods that might arise from a badly managed brexit however these concerns are already to a degree discounted in the current valuations of uk smaller companies and our investment adviser remains in close contact with our investee companies to assess the impact of any ultimate brexit scenario on their trading prospects board refreshment the board were very pleased to be able to announce the appointment of nigel sidebottom as a non executive director in february 2019 we believe that retaining nigel s wealth of experience in closed ended funds and acorn in particular following his retirement from premier will be valuable to shareholders the next step in this process is that i am standing down from the board at the agm in august 2019 having served 12 years as a board member and 7 years as your chairman the board are currently looking for a further director to replace me amendments to the management agreement your directors have negotiated amendments to the management agreement that formalise within a contractual framework many of the ancillary services that the manager provides such as asset allocation shareholder relations and the provision and maintenance of a website in conjunction with these amendments the notice period on the management agreement has been negotiated down from 12 months to 6 which the directors regard as best market practice however recognising the added contractual burden placed on the manager through these changes your directors agreed to an initial 12 month period before any notice to terminate the contract can be served as this change could result in a higher termination cost to the company if notice was served during the first 6 months the change has been categorised as a smaller related party transaction under the fca s listing rules contact with shareholders shareholders are always welcome to attend the annual general meeting in august or to contact me directly through the email address acorn_income_fund_limited ntrs com there is a dedicated website where you may also like to find further information thank you for your ongoing support as an investor in our company helen green chairman investment advisers report the smaller companies portfolio during the twelve month period to 31 december 2018 the smaller companies portfolio generated a total return 14 0 outperforming a fall of 15 4 by the numis smaller companies index ex investment companies nsci 2018 was a tough year for equity markets globally as investors faced the prospect of slowing global growth tighter monetary policy an escalating trade war between the us and china and the impact of the ongoing uncertainty surrounding brexit in uk markets this dynamic resulted in negative index returns across the major indices with uk small and mid caps underperforming their larger quoted peers the smaller companies portfolio was not immune to this dynamic but did manage to outperform the nsci during the period following a relatively strong year for the portfolio in 2017 the period under review proved far more challenging with brexit in particular affecting the valuations of more domestically focussed companies a fall in the value of sterling against the us dollar during the year took the decline since the eu referendum in 2016 to over 14 reversing some of the sterling recovery witnessed in 2017 this overall trend continues to favour the more internationally focussed large caps over smaller quoted companies the uncertainty around brexit has created a challenging combination of weaker consumer confidence and significantly higher input costs from imported goods the final quarter of 2018 was particularly challenging as expectations of rising interest rates in the us triggered a sharp sell off in equities globally the smaller companies portfolio fell by 10 8 during the quarter holding up a little better than the nsci decline of 13 1 at the time of writing the terms of our exit from the eu remain unclear and although we believe the overall operational impact on our holdings has been limited to date it has clearly affected investors appetite for uk equities we remain hopeful of a satisfactory outcome emerging from this disappointing episode in british politics although exactly what shape any agreement will take remains to be seen in the meantime equity valuations are increasingly appealing companies overall remain in relatively good health and dividend payments continue to grow as a result we enter 2019 with a high quality selection of companies in the portfolio at very attractive valuations the number of holdings within the portfolio fell by three to 46 during the period following the addition of four new holdings and disposal of seven positions the portfolio participated in one initial public offering ipo during the period integrafin 54bps a platform provider to financial advisors unusually for the portfolio that ipo was bought and sold in the period following strong share price growth and resultant yield compression locking in significant profit the six remaining disposals were midwich van elle bba aviation low bonar headlam and conviviality which was the biggest stock specific story of the period and unfortunately a negative one conviviality 379bps was the primary detractor from performance during the period despite issuing an inline trading update at the end of january 2018 just 5 weeks later the company released a series of extremely disappointing market updates in quick succession and ultimately confirmed that it had appointed administrators we wrote down the value of the remaining holding to zero after the suspension of the shares whilst performance for the period has been severely hampered by conviviality we remain in positive territory overall on this investment as a result of active profit taking and dividend income received during the holding period of over four and a half years other negative contributors to performance came from warpaint 164bps and clipper logistics 128bps warpaint a cosmetics business issued a profit warning in autumn indicating that pre christmas resupply orders from retailers had been lower than anticipated clipper logistics an e fulfilment and logistics services company had lower than expected final results against the backdrop of a weaker retail environment negative returns from other holdings were generally driven by deratings on market sentiment rather than stock specific issues the extent of this derating was stark with the average price earnings multiple on the portfolio falling by some 18 over the year as such the portfolio now sits at far more attractive valuations than it did at the beginning of the period in addition to the ipo mentioned above new positions were initiated in marshalls the block paving manufacturer and supplier to the commercial and domestic market iomart the provider of managed hosting and saga the over 50s focussed provider of insurance and travel services notable positive contributions to performance came from telecom plus 59bps the parent company of utility warehouse somero 58bps the manufacturer of concrete screeding equipment and as mentioned above integrafin 54bps this was clearly a challenging period for the portfolio as a combination of negative market sentiment and one major stock specific issue combined to generate a disappointing negative total return albeit ahead of the portfolio benchmark despite this setback we remain confident with the long term prospects for our investee companies the continued growth in dividends received during the year provides further confidence in the strength of the portfolio and the derating experienced over the year positions the portfolio on an attractive valuation as ever we remain mindful of the significant external factors which have led to fairly volatile markets in 2018 and will continue to influence equities in the coming year against this back drop we continue to invest in the best smaller companies we can find which offer the attractive combination of growing profits and dividend income over our long term investment horizon fraser mackersie and simon moon unicorn asset management limited the income portfolio the tightening of global monetary policy and the historically tight spreads offered on corporate bonds were our biggest concerns for bond markets at the start of the year indeed both scenarios provided headwinds to investors at different points of the year culminating with a material sell off in corporate bonds into the year end as softening macro data raised market concerns about slowing global growth and possible recession risk at the same time liquidity conditions are still tightening the fed has tried to reassure the market that its path is data dependent whilst the ecb still appear on a slow but sure course towards tighter monetary policy meanwhile the bank of england has continually raised concerns about the tightness of uk labour markets with a lack of clarity on how the uk will exit the eu seemingly the main barrier to further rate hikes in the meantime uncertainty weighs on business and consumer confidence against this backdrop the outlook for credit valuations still feels challenged especially if slower growth and lower corporate earnings transpire we maintain that long dated high duration credit will continue to be volatile and vulnerable to further capital losses and prefer to maintain more modest duration exposure in instruments which we feel have better risk return characteristics examples of bonds which fit this criteria and have the benefit of adding some global exposure away from the uk include wells fargo bonds which mature in 2022 and fidelity international bonds maturing in 2024 which both have an attractive yield relative to an equivalent gilt hybrid bonds issued by telecoms company orange have an attractive yield to call in 2023 which we feel the company is likely to exercise we also hold protection against rising us inflation whilst inflation in the u s has fallen some members of the u s federal reserve have suggested that it is considering letting inflation run hotter in some periods to balance out periods of undershooting and this should mean that inflation risk needs to be priced higher markets also seem too complacent that falling inflation is a foregone trend especially as wage growth continues to rise and could work its way into higher output prices as companies look to sustain margins of course the weakness in some uk corporate bonds provides an attractive opportunity especially when the instrument is short dated giving greater visibility over the earnings and debt profile the negative impact on sentiment within uk property enables us to hold british land convertible bonds offering an attractive yield as a regular bond with under two years until maturity and a low debt profile another uk company performing well but subject to the poor sentiment caused by brexit uncertainty is phoenixlife which is demonstrating the benefits of its recent acquisitions by meeting increased cash flow targets and raising regulatory capital levels away from the bond markets the portfolio holds more alternative investments to diversify risk these include strategies focused on the discount that an investment trades at rather than taking a directional view on the investment in addition some of these discount opportunities have been bought with a specific short term catalyst such as a continuation vote which could erode the discount other alternative holdings to bonds include supermarket income reit which offers a yield of double the broad bond market from a portfolio of defensive supermarket property assets the portfolio also holds some structured investments which give a range of exposures including buying protection from widening credit spreads defined returns contingent on equity index levels and relative performance differentials between uk property shares importantly the relationship between bonds and equities appears to be less predictable these days and the safest government bonds feel like an expensive hedging tool for risk assets given the unwinding of ultra loose monetary policy and the low yields on offer the historical negative correlation benefits of bonds rising when equity markets fall seems to be a much more uncertain relationship as we witnessed at various points during the last year holding some investments with different drivers of returns from traditional bond markets as well as shorter duration more defensive bond holdings is therefore important in endeavouring to deliver a more absolute return profile the majority of currency risk within the portfolio is reduced by using foreign exchange contracts so that currency movements are not a driver of the portfolio s return paul smith premier fund managers limited schedule of principal investments as at 31 december 2018

discontinuation resolution will be proposed at the annual general meeting in 2021 foreign account tax compliance act fatca fatca requires certain financial institutions outside the united states us to pass information about their us customers to the us tax authorities the internal revenue service the irs a 30 withholding tax is imposed on the us source income and disposal of assets of any financial institution within the scope of the legislation that fails to comply with this requirement the board of the company has taken all necessary steps to ensure that the company is fatca compliant and confirms that the company is registered and has been issued a global intermediary identification number giin by the irs the company will use its giin to identify that it is fatca compliant to all financial counterparties common reporting standard the common reporting standard crs is a global standard for the automatic exchange of financial account information developed by the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd which has been adopted in guernsey and which came into effect in january 2016 the company is subject to guernsey regulations and guidance on the automatic exchange of tax information and the board will therefore take the necessary actions to ensure that the company is compliant in this regard going concern in the opinion of the directors the company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future for this reason the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis the directors have arrived at this opinion by considering inter alia the following factors the company has sufficient liquidity to meet all ongoing expenses the company has net current assets of 2 999 832 at the year end in january 2017 the zdp shares were refinanced and their life was extended to 28 february 2022 in addition the board regularly reviews the cash flow of the company and is confident that the company will have sufficient resources to meet all future obligations both the income and smaller companies portfolios consist substantially of listed investments which are readily realisable and therefore the company has sufficient resources to meet its liquidity requirements and as at 31 december 2018 the company had no borrowings other than the zdp shares which as explained in note 13 have a final capital entitlement on 28 february 2022 viability statement in accordance with provision c 2 2 of the uk corporate governance code published by the financial reporting council in september 2014 the code the directors have assessed the prospects of the company over the three year period to 31 december 2021 the directors consider that three years is an appropriate period to assess the viability of an investment company for the purpose of giving assurance to shareholders in determining the appropriate period of assessment the directors had regard to the general advice that equity investment should be made on a medium to longer term view perhaps 3 to 10 years but also to evidence that the average holding time for an equity investment is under 3 years the directors consider that 3 years is a sufficient investment time horizon to be relevant to shareholders and that choosing a longer time period can present difficulties given the lack of longer term economic visibility in its assessment of the viability of the company the directors have considered each of the company s principal risks and uncertainties detailed in the principal risks section on the following pages and in note 18 and in particular the potential impact on the company and its activities of a disorderly brexit and the impact of a significant fall in equity markets on the value of the company s investment portfolio the directors have also considered the company s income and expenditure projections and the fact that the company s investments comprise readily realisable securities which can be expected to be sold to meet funding requirements if necessary the directors also noted that the next discontinuation resolution will be proposed at the annual general meeting in 2021 based on the company s processes for monitoring operating costs share price discount the manager s compliance with the investment objective asset allocation the portfolio risk profile gearing counterparty exposure liquidity risk and financial controls the directors have concluded that there is a reasonable expectation that the company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three year period to 31 december 2021 gearing policy the company s gearing policy is not to employ any gearing through long term bank borrowing save with the prior sanction of the zdp shareholders the company will not incur any indebtedness other than short term borrowings in the normal course of business such as to settle share trades or borrowings to finance the redemption of the zdp shares results and dividends the results attributable to ordinary shareholders for the period are shown in the statement of comprehensive income the company made a revenue return for the year of 21 62 pence 2017 20 36 pence per ordinary share and a capital loss of 103 97 pence 2017 capital return of 77 09 pence per ordinary share principal risks the board has an on going process in place for identifying evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the company the responsibility for carrying out the risk review is undertaken by the risk committee see the directors report for details of the risk committee which meets at least four times per year the results of the risk evaluations are then reported back to the board the last risk assessment took place on 5 february 2019 the current process is in line with the association of investment companies aic code of corporate governance the aic code companyrisks risks of the structure of the company and gearing the company s business could be materially and adversely affected by a number of risks external factors to the company may either adversely or favourably affect the volatility and liquidity of the smaller companies portfolio and income portfolio the portfolios as well as their values these can be caused by economic conditions changes to tax laws competition and a number of other factors investors holding either ordinary shares or zdp shares should have carefully considered whether these investments given the risks attached are suitable for them the market value of zdp shares will be affected by changes in general interest rates with upward movements in interest rates likely to lead to reductions in the market value of zdp shares although not affecting the ultimate redemption value although the holders of zdp shares have a priority entitlement to the other assets of the company after payment of its liabilities on a winding up if the gross assets of the company fall to a level that is insufficient to redeem the zdp shares in full investors in the zdp shares would receive a lower payment than the fixed capital entitlement on the zdp shares repayment date in certain circumstances such as a major fall in the capital value of the portfolios such that the final capital entitlement of the zdp shares is significantly uncovered but where the company s portfolios are still generating revenue the interests of zdp shareholders and the ordinary shareholders may conflict in such circumstances the directors may find it impossible to meet fully both sets of expectations and so will need to act in a manner which they consider to be fair and equitable to both ordinary shareholders and zdp shareholders but having regard to the entitlements of each class of shares further risks to the zdp shares include the lower level of regulatory protection than applies to premium listed shares the ordinary shares are geared by the zdp shares and should be regarded as carrying above average risk since a positive net asset value nav for the ordinary shareholders will be dependent upon the company s assets being sufficient to meet those prior entitlements of the holders of zdp shares as a consequence of the gearing a decline in the value of the company s investment portfolio will result in a greater percentage decline in the nav of the ordinary shares ordinary shareholders do not have a right for their shares to be redeemed and those ordinary shareholders wishing to realise their investment will be required to dispose of their shares on the stock market market liquidity in the shares of companies such as the company is less than market liquidity in shares issued by larger companies traded on the lse there can be no guarantee that a liquid market will exist for the ordinary shares or the zdp shares which may prevent any holder of ordinary shares or zdp shares from disposing of such shares at a price or at such time that they wish the company s future performance depends on the success of its strategy the skill and judgements of the investment manager and of the investment advisers the departure of key personnel of either provider may have an adverse effect on the performance of the company the company may use derivatives to hedge exposure to currency risk and interest rate risk no assurance can be given that any hedging strategies which may be used by the company will be successful under all or any market conditions and if unsuccessful could have an adverse effect on the company s financial position risk associated with investment in other investment companies the income portfolio may contain higher yielding investment company shares including shares of split capital investment trusts as a result of the gearing in some investment company shares any increase or decrease in the value of the investments held by those investment companies might magnify movements in their nav and consequently affect the value of the income portfolio in accordance with the listing rules where appropriate the company makes stock exchange announcements detailing its holdings in other uk listed investment companies which themselves do not have a stated investment policy to invest no more than 15 of their gross assets in other uk listed investment companies including investment trusts market price risk since the company invests in financial instruments market price risk is inherent in these investments in order to minimise this risk a detailed analysis of the risk reward relationship of each investee company is undertaken by the investment advisers prior to making investments interest rate risk the company s investment portfolios particularly the income portfolio include investments bearing interest at fixed rates generally when interest rates rise the market prices of fixed interest securities fall and when interest rates fall the prices of fixed interest securities rise the company will therefore be exposed to movements in interest rates the company has fixed rate leverage through its zdp shares in january 2017 the redemption date of the company s zdp shares was extended to 28 february 2022 at a rate of 3 85 per annum replacing this leverage in 2022 might involve the company paying a higher accrual rate on an issue of new zdp shares if interest rates have risen liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk that the company will encounter difficulties in meeting its obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivery of cash or another financial asset some of the company s investments in smaller company equities and in certain bond issues may have relatively low levels of daily turnover such that it might take several days or even weeks to sell a holding into the market discount volatility being a closed end fund the company s shares may trade at a discount or premium to their nav the magnitude of this discount or premium fluctuates daily and can vary significantly thus for a given period of time it is possible that the market price could decrease despite an increase in the company s nav the directors review the discount levels regularly the investment advisers actively communicate with the company s major shareholders and potential new investors with the aim of managing discount levels brexit the uk s vote to leave the eu has introduced new uncertainties and instability into the financial markets as the process of a major country leaving the eu has no precedent the board and the investment manager expect an ongoing period of market uncertainty as the implications are processed company performance key performance indicators and analysis of company s performance at each quarterly board meeting the directors consider a number of performance measures in order to assess the company s success in achieving its objectives the key areas reviewed are as follows review of the history of the nav receive an update on the market activity of the ordinary shares and the zdp shares by numis securities limited the company s corporate broker receive updates on the performance of both the income portfolio and the smaller companies portfolio from the investment advisers discount to nav consideration of the revenue projection on going charges and total expense ratio the ter the annual on going charges figure for the year was 1 57 2017 1 53 this figure which has been prepared in accordance with the recommended methodology provided by the association of investment companies and represents the annual percentage reduction in shareholder returns as a result of recurring operational expenses in 2018 a performance fee amounting to nil 2017 559 967 was accrued the ter of the company is calculated as a percentage of costs against total assets at the year end and is capped at 1 5 for 2018 the ter was 1 24 2017 1 04 the calculation of costs excludes performance fees non routine administration and professional fees the net management fee charged in 2018 was 722 795 2017 729 457 share price rating and discount management including information on treasury shares at the annual general meeting on 20 august 2018 the directors obtained shareholder approval to issue up to 1 591 668 ordinary shares and 2 136 522 zdp shares also obtaining the necessary pre emption waiver from the zdp shareholders in respect of any new issue of zdp shares the shareholders approved renewal of the company s authority to buy back ordinary shares and zdp shares up to 14 99 as at 20 august 2018 2 385 911 ordinary shares and 3 202 646 zdp shares were authorised to be purchased the directors also obtained authority to sell from treasury ordinary shares at a discount to the prevailing nav per ordinary share provided that the authority conferred was limited to issues or sales of ordinary shares at the same time as zdp shares are issued or sold from treasury at a premium such that the combined effect of the issue or sale of ordinary shares and the issue or sale of zdp shares at a premium is that i the nav per ordinary share is thereby increased and ii gearing is not thereby increased the company intends to seek annual renewal of these authorities from shareholders at each future general meeting to be held under section 199 of the law in accordance with the law any share buy backs will be affected by the purchase of a package of ordinary shares and zdp shares in a specified ratio as set out in the company s prospectus in the market for cash at a package price which in aggregate is at a discount to the prevailing navs of each class of share where the directors believe such a purchase will enhance shareholder value shares which are purchased may be cancelled or held in treasury investment management and administration management agreement and fees the board is responsible for the determination of the company s investment policy and has overall responsibility for the company s day to day activities the company has however entered into a management agreement with pamg a wholly owned guernsey incorporated subsidiary of premier asset management group plc the manager has discretion to make minor changes to the portfolios and also has discretion to move cash from the smaller companies portfolio to the income portfolio the manager will refer any proposals to the board to materially alter the split of assets between the income portfolio and the smaller companies portfolio the board determines when any potential investment limits can be exceeded dividend levels and the appropriate issue size for the zdp shares and hence the level of gearing under separate investment adviser agreements pamg has delegated a number of its duties and responsibilities to pfm and unicorn in relation to the income portfolio and smaller companies portfolio respectively both pfm and unicorn act as investment advisers who are responsible for the identification and analysis of investments meeting the investment objectives and strategy

have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion key audit matters our assessment of the risks of material misstatement key audit matters are those matters that in our professional judgment were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement whether or not due to fraud identified by us including those which had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters in arriving at our audit opinion above the key audit matters were as follows the impact of uncertainties due to the uk exiting the european union on our audit refer to the viability statement principal risks and financial disclosures unprecedented levels of uncertainty all audits assess and challenge the reasonableness of estimates and related disclosures and the appropriateness of the going concern basis of preparation of the financial statements see below all of these depend on assessments of the future economic environment and the company s future prospects and performance in addition we are required to consider the other information presented in the annual report including the principal risks disclosure and the viability statement and to consider the directors statement that the annual report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the company s position and performance business model and strategy brexit is one of the most significant economic events for the uk and at the date of this report its effects are subject to unprecedented levels of uncertainty of outcomes with the full range of possible effects unknown we developed a standardised firm wide approach to the consideration of the uncertainties arising from brexit in planning and performing our audits our procedures included our brexit knowledge we considered the directors assessment of brexit related sources of risk for the company s business and financial resources compared with our own understanding of the risks we considered the directors plans to take action to mitigate the risks sensitivity analysis when addressing the valuation of investments we compared the directors analysis to our assessment of the full range of reasonably possible scenarios resulting from brexit uncertainty assessing transparency as well as assessing individual disclosures as part of our procedures on the valuation of investments we considered all of the brexit related disclosures together including those in the chairman s statement and directors report comparing the overall picture against our understanding of the risks however no audit should be expected to predict the unknowable factors or all possible future implications for a company and this is particularly the case in relation to brexit valuation of investments

represents the majority of the company s net assets is considered to be a significant area of our audit our audit procedures included but were not limited to use of kpmg valuation specialist to independently price listed investments to a third party pricing source for structured notes our valuation specialist assisted us with the assessment of the quality and integrity of the price quotes through comparison to available quotes from independent sources or through applying a valuation model based on contractual terms and market data assessing disclosures we also considered the company s

as some countries struggle with the burden of cheap oil others pursue fresh growth opportunities tighter fiscal policies and oil output cuts agreed to by the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec plus russia could cause economic growth in the middle east region to slow this year favorable demographics will underpin long term growth in the decades ahead but productivity gains will be slow economists say despite efforts to diversify their economies the arab gulf countries will remain reliant on their oil and gas sectors for years to come as the swing producer in opec saudi arabia has carried out the bulk of the oil production cuts reducing its output by 400 000 barrels per day bpd and planning even deeper cuts meanwhile us oil output is expected to increase by 1 8 million bpd this year brazil is also producing more oil following an increase of 365 000 bpd in 2018 the largest increase in 20 years according to the international energy agency the increasing energy independence of the us is one factor that has prompted some commentators to question whether saudi arabia still has the power to influence global oil prices says caroline bain chief commodities economist at capital economics saudi arabia the world s third largest producer after the us and russia remains the world s largest exporter of oil bain says capacity to export is a much bigger driver of oil prices than production she says saudi arabia has the largest spare production capacity in the world and the kingdom s ability to influence the oil market is clearly evident in the latest round of opec cuts according to bain saudi arabia s action led to a 20 rally in prices and moved the futures curve into backwardation when futures contracts trade at a price below the expected spot price at maturity the us saudi oil relationship has been transformed by the growth in us oil supply and the us is arguably in a stronger position in the bilateral relationship bain says however saudi arabia can still move oil prices with implications for global gdp growth and consumer spending as such mutual dependence remains james reeve chief economist at riyadh based samba financial group says the us china trade dispute and china s slower growth will have spillover effects on other economies and impact demand for oil we still expect the market to tighten somewhat as opec reductions begin to bite and there should be some uplift in prices reeve says however the upside is limited and we expect an average price for brent this year of 65 per barrel edging up to 67 in 2020 as a weaker dollar helps to support demand reeve says the medium term outlook for saudi arabia remains positive with structural reforms continuing the fiscal outlook is manageable given multiple financing options and a low debt stock he says s p global ratings expects sovereign long term commercial borrowing in the middle east and north africa to increase by 25 this year to 139 billion after declining 38 in 2018 moody s says global sovereign sukuk issuance will recover in 2019 to 115 billion due to higher deficit financing needs as the merits of islamic finance allow the sector to grow into new geographies meanwhile the local private sector in saudi arabia is gradually adapting to the withdrawal of state largesse but the adjustment hasn t been easy and investment is still subdued samba s reeve says the departure of an estimated 1 7 million expatriates has also meant significant hits to both the demand and supply sides of the economy he says the mass departure of expatriates in the face of higher fees and saudization initiatives is probably the strongest headwind in many cases saudi nationals haven t filled the gaps left by the departing foreigners the saudi reform agenda vision 2030 seeks to restructure the economy so that productivity growth becomes the driver of income gains rather than the simple accumulation of cheap labor and capital reeve says naturally such a fundamental shift will be difficult for many firms and the government is adjusting the pace of reform accordingly he says postponing the aramco initial public offering ipo doesn t signal that the reform effort has stalled reeve says the reform push is continuing with less eye catching legal and business environment initiatives which are likely to be more important in the long run than the sale of 5 of saudi aramco he says labor productivity growth in saudi arabia has been negative since 2012 according to research by marmore mena intelligence a unit of kuwait based markaz throughout the past decade the arab states have had the lowest output per worker in constant dollars among high income countries the study found one of the major impediments for private sector growth in the gulf cooperation council gcc countries is a lack of skilled labor the study says better incentives for expat workers such as access to long term or permanent residence could help retain productive high skilled migrant workers and also support the region s push toward a knowledge based economy according to marmore in addition labor market reforms should aim to create jobs for nationals by increasing the incentives for them to work in the private sector the report says jason tuvey senior emerging markets economist at capital economics says the countries of the gulf are in a relatively good position to withstand a decline in oil revenue as a result of production cuts and relatively low prices capital economics expects the price of brent crude the international benchmark to decline to 50 per barrel by the end of this year the region s recovery is set to falter in 2019 and growth is likely to be weaker than most expect tuvey says low oil prices shouldn t cause major strains in the gulf but tighter fiscal policy and oil output cuts mean growth will soften in contrast to the gulf the rest of the region stands to benefit from low oil prices tuvey says the most promising outlook is in egypt where the pace of austerity will slow he says meanwhile weak domestic demand has pushed several gulf economies into deflation partly reflecting downturns in housing markets balance sheets in the gulf are in relatively good shape but there are pockets of vulnerability tuvey says we ve warned for some time about fragile sovereign balance sheets in bahrain and oman although their debt dynamics are more likely to be affected by swings in oil prices than deflation he says among gulf countries the united arab emirates uae may be the most resilient to lower real oil prices the uae is relatively diversified and has integrated into global supply chains by establishing itself as a manufacturing and logistics hub for the region tuvey says in contrast to the rest of the gulf fiscal policy should remain fairly supportive infrastructure spending will be ramped up as preparations for the world expo gather pace on a less upbeat note the dilapidated infrastructure in iraq and the eventual reconstruction of syria will require the investment of hundreds of billions of dollars as detailed in this supplement s story on syria it remains unclear who is going to rebuild the war torn nation its current government is working with russia iran and china saudi arabia and the uae which supported the rebels are now seeking to re engage with the government of syrian president bashar al assad to limit turkey s bid for regional supremacy iraq s 112 billion budget for 2019 is one of the largest since the fall of saddam hussein in 2003 the country is now opec s second largest oil producer and violence has declined to the lowest level in six years but despite the improvements the country still isn t an appropriate destination for faint hearted investors according to analysts getting a reliable supply of electricity to the population in time for the summer heat wave will be critical elsewhere in the gulf qatar s international dollar diplomacy has gathered momentum since the beginning of the economic blockade by regional neighbors including saudi arabia the uae bahrain and egypt qatar has extended a 500 million in economic aid to jordan and purchased 500 million of lebanese government bonds in iraq qatar will provide 1 billion for infrastructure and construction projects gas rich qatar has extensive investments worldwide including in britain and the us it has joined exxon mobil in a 10 billion investment in natural gas exports qatar s ties with turkey also have been strengthened as have its connections with china japan malaysia and south korea the record of investment flows into the gulf cooperation council gcc countries paints a mixed picture according to another report in this supplement riyadh s bid to attract foreign investment is clearly visible in the evolution of its capital markets in june msci is due to include saudi arabia in its benchmark emerging markets index following a similar move in march by ftse russell these moves could attract up to 45 billion of investments from institutions this year public private partnerships are likely to feature prominently in saudi arabia s bid for foreign capital for its grandiose infrastructure projects and to carry out the goals of its vision 2030 reforms however the kingdom s erratic progress in privatization projects suggests investors will demand improvements in governance and transparency before committing their funds reforms to financial and legal frameworks provide a smoother path for more foreign direct investment fdi in the gcc countries but geopolitical and regional political issues are still a stumbling block dubai a longstanding magnet for fdi has become too expensive for some bahrain which is struggling financially is seeking to capitalize on its cost advantage to woo investment and reclaim business lost to its increasingly costly neighbor meanwhile bahrain s regulators are leading reforms to encourage innovation and entrepreneurship in fintech bahrain fintech bay was launched as a public private partnership a year ago and it now has more than 50 established partners including american express cisco and microsoft islamic finance offers a clear opportunity for bahrain s emerging fintech sector faced with low oil prices and rapidly changing economies gcc banks are sticking together to remain competitive again this year major lenders have announced mergers and acquisitions and the trend is

transcript of international monetary fund managing director christine lagarde s opening press conference 2019 spring meetings speakers christine lagarde managing director imf david lipton first deputy managing director imf gerry rice director communications department imf mr rice good morning everyone and welcome to these spring meetings it is lovely to see everybody here this morning we are delighted to have with us this morning the managing director of the imf madame christine lagarde we also have the first deputy managing director of the imf david lipton i think you all have received the managing director s global policy agenda i will ask you this morning to be brief in your questions please stick to one question and identify yourself by name and affiliation we will try to take as many questions as we can with that i would like to ask madame lagarde to make a few opening remarks madame lagarde thank you very much gerry and good morning to all of you welcome to the 2019 spring meetings i would like first of all to congratulate david malpass who was with you a moment ago who has just been appointed elected president of the world bank and we all look forward to continuing the good cooperation that we have had within the institutions focusing on our respective goals before i turn to a few words about the global outlook i would like to just express on behalf of the institution our heartfelt condolences to the three countries that have been mostly hit by the recent cyclone idai mozambique zimbabwe malawi and i can tell you that the government of mozambique has submitted a request for the rapid credit facility which provides speedy access to concessional financing from the fund and we are moving forward as quickly as we can it will not be pledges it will not be promises it will be prompt payment as soon as the board has approved it i am also pleased to tell you that yesterday our staff mission team announced that they have reached agreement with the zimbabwean government on a new staff monitored program which will help them address deep economic problems and provide an important stepping stone to a more stable situation so with that i would like to make a couple of comments on the global economic outlook that you have received a couple of days ago and many of you have attended the press conference organized under leadership of our new chief economist gita gopinath and i would like to also comment very briefly on our work going forward i was reminded by my staff of a lovely line by mark twain bear with me in the spring i have counted 136 different kinds of weather inside of 24 hours i am not suggesting that the global economy is going through the 136 different iterations from synchronized growth to synchronized slowdown but it feels a little bit like that at this point in time and this uncertainty in nature that by the way will be commented upon by sir david attenborough at 12 noon a moment that i encourage you to attend where he will talk about not just the beauty but the peril of nature and how much damage is inflicted upon nature but just like nature the global economy is also currently quite uncertain as i said a year ago we were talking about synchronized growth and 75 percent of the global economy was going through that phase as you heard a couple of days ago we are now talking about a synchronized slowdown by 70 percent of the global economy so our forecast for growth this year is 3 3 percent going back up we hope in 2020 based on our forecast to 3 6 percent but we contend that we are at a delicate moment and this expected rebound from 3 3 in 2019 to 3 6 in 2020 is precarious and is subject to downside risks ranging from unresolved trade tensions high debt in some sectors and countries both public and corporate to the risk of weaker than expected growth in some stressed economies and of course the consequences of whatever brexit will be so in terms of policy recommendations what can be done about this moment of uncertainty and precarious possible pickup i would suggest not a single policy but multiple policies because it will have to be country specific and there is no one size fits all but we certainly would recommend two key principles one is do no harm second do the right thing so do no harm the key is to avoid the wrong policies and this is especially the case for trade we know that for many decades trade integration has helped boost productivity innovation growth employment and has reduced the cost of living particularly for the low income people at the same time we know that the engine of growth needs to be fixed we need to better address dislocations caused by trade and by technological innovation however intertwined they are and we need to do more for those who are left behind we need to better address unfair trade practices and distortions in the system including through a wto system reform and we need to avoid self inflicted wounds including tariffs and other barriers so that was for the do no harm do the right thing i would mention a few first of all when i said a year ago the sun is shining fix the room well fix the roof is still needed and there are still many reforms that are outstanding and should be the focus of policymakers because it would help boost potential output to prevent disappointing long term growth in advanced economies and it would help developing countries catch up with their wealthier peers which is a process that we see slowing down at the moment second create more room in order to resist the next crisis when the downturn comes and that means enhancing resilience by making smarter use of fiscal policy and by strengthening financial sector policies and discipline so the third one fix the roof create more space for when the next downturn comes up and tackle issues that have a high potential to boost not only revenue but also growth and inclusion and such issues have been the focus of particular chapters in our publications in the last couple of days they include reforming the international taxation system in particular corporate taxation which is the focus of our publication strengthening competition framework and above all and this is going to be a lot of work in the months to come for us fight corruption at both ends supply and demand and in all of these efforts we need stronger international cooperation we need those policymakers who i would call the women and the men for all seasons in order to resist that uncertainty that we have at the moment and in i will quote shakespeare now in order to deal with the uncertain glory of this april day so with that you have seen our global policy agenda for 2019 and this is what i would like to finish with if you look at it carefully it is much longer than what we normally do in the spring in the spring we do a gpa update a global policy agenda update and the longer version of it is at the annual meetings this one is longer because we tried to focus on the various layers of what i have called this new multilateralism that we are calling for which has domestic implications cross border implications and an international cooperation imperative with a strong focus on the people you will see that we are going to look at many of our policies our guidelines our methods our operations in order to provide in the next decade the best possible services for the membership we are looking at our debt sustainability analysis we are looking at our conditionalities we are looking at improving our low income country facilities we are looking at a more comprehensive surveillance so that we can harness the benefits of technologies best practices in all countries around the world in order to provide the services that are expected by the membership those are only some examples of the major work that we are anticipating in the months to come and it is an investment that will deliver fruit in the next many years we hope thank you very much mr rice thank you very much madame lagarde let s begin with the questions i want to start in the front row over here yes cctv thank you question thank you very much madame lagarde my question is to you good morning madame lagarde good morning question how concerned are you that it looks like politics is playing an increasing role in contributing to global policy uncertainties by politics i mean both domestic politics and global geopolitical rivalries also could you secondly comment on china s recent stimulus measures thank you madame lagarde many of you know me i try to look at the half full glass not the half empty and what should give us hope and what should renew our energy is the fact that many of the risks that i have mentioned many of the clouds on the horizon can actually be addressed effectively and positively precisely by politics at home and by international cooperation at the international levels so it is a question of what people want in order to fix some of those issues so i am more concerned about making sure that the facts the numbers the interconnection between policies and consequences are actually properly documented and evidenced and that is where i see that we have a role to play on the chinese stimulus as you know our forecast for growth is 6 3 this year 6 1 next year a regular anticipated slight moderation year after year as we have observed it and certainly a shift towards quality growth the recent stimulus that was decided by the chinese authorities actually as it is as it stands has been welcomed and we thought that it was the right approach under the circumstances and it goes together with those fundamental policies that have been enacted now for semesters after semesters of keeping the credit mechanisms and flow under control in order to rein in excessive investment mr rice thank you staying over on the right in the second row financial times please question madame lagarde you used language like the global economy is at a delicate moment the recovery is precarious financial markets are seeing this more as something that was happening last year and that a lot of the risks have dissipated this year do you think financial markets are now complacent madame lagarde well we see the financial markets as having taken a lot of energy out of the change of monetary policy change of monetary policy as broadcasted in a clear communication and on the basis of data by quite a few central banks including the fed including the ecb european central bank including the bank of england and a few others so they have taken comfort from that change of monetary policy and they are probably pricing in as well a few of those man made solutions that we all hope for including possibly on the trade tension front mr rice ok thank you very much i am going to swing around here and take the lady on the left here i think it is russia is it not madame lagarde we cannot see you very well because it is all dark question i am in the red madame lagarde well done question thank you so much first of all thank you for doing this i am with russian news agency and the imf did not change the forecast for russia and by using your words why is it a bright future or still cloudy thank you madame lagarde well certainly spring is in the air and winter is not coming right in terms of the calendar i think we have slightly downgraded both for 2019 and 2020 not a lot but we have downgraded relative to our previous forecast for russia as we have for many other countries you know we cannot have 70 percent of the global economy decelerating without having a relatively widespread downgrade across the spectrum of countries and just like for many other countries we have russia going up a bit in 2020 because we believe that it will benefit from that same momentum but the fiscal monetary and generally the macro situation of russia is pretty healthy when you look at numbers whether it is debt current account surplus fiscal surplus and what have you we still think that more in depth structural reforms are needed in order to make sure that the growth potential of russia is increased because you know with 1 6 1 7 growth russia is not you know moving very high in terms of gdp mr rice thank you i am staying over here and we are still in the dark but with the lady in white question inaudible right now risk for the global economy and for the eurozone so i would like to ask you what urgent measures the italian government should undertake right now and at the same time you know that the italian government would like to cut taxes if this could be part of the solution according to you or not thank you madame lagarde well first of all i am reassured by a process that has taken place in the banking sector and i think under the leadership of the central bank the fact that the nonperforming loans volume is gradually declining and more so than is reported so i am pleased to say that there is more work to do but certainly the work has started and there is a real decline which is necessary in order to strengthen the banking system on the fiscal front we read the statements we appreciate the intention i think what is really needed is some identifiable measurable credible measures that will deliver on the intention of the authorities you know we like to see hard real measures and understand exactly how they can be measured against the intentions mr rice ok i want to take an africa question nigeria here in the front please thank you question thank you madame lagarde good morning in your recent staff article iv consultation report on nigeria one of the recommendations was that the fuel subsidy should be removed for us it is a very sensitive issue because we think that at the present rate the subsidy it made the price too high so why would you recommend the removal of the subsidy from the fuel price thank you madame lagarde i will give you the general principle for various reasons and as a general principle we believe that removing fossil fuel subsidies is the right way to go if you look at our numbers from 2015 it is no less than about 5 2 trillion that are spent on fuel subsidies and the consequences thereof and the fiscal affairs department has actually identified you know how much would have been saved fiscally but also in terms of human life if there had been the right price on carbon emission as of 2015 the numbers are quite staggering if that was to happen then there would be more public spending available to build hospitals to build roads to build schools and to support education and health for the people now how this is done is more complicated because there has to be a social protection safety net that is in place so that the most exposed in the population do not take the brunt of the removal of subsidies principle so that is the position we take i would add as a footnote as far as nigeria is concerned that with the low revenue mobilization that exists in the country in terms of tax to gdp nigeria is amongst the lowest a real effort has to be done in order to maintain a good public finance situation for the country and in order to direct investment towards health education and infrastructure mr rice thank you madame lagarde i am going to take the times of london thank you question good morning madame lagarde the inevitable brexit question we have just had a six month extension given to the u k by the eu or agreed by both bodies i just wondered if you thought that this is a great relief both for the u k and europe or whether you are concerned that all this does is kick the can down the road it just prolongs uncertainty and that it does not really resolve the whole issue madame lagarde well again having my positive hat on it removes the risk of the no deal brexit on april 12 which was one of the options that was considered so at least the u k is not leaving on the 12th of april without a deal on the other hand it gives time for continued discussions between the various parties involved in the u k it probably gives time to the economic agents to better prepare for all options and you know i am particularly thinking of the industrialists and the workers in the u k in order to try to secure their future that that gives a bit more time on the other hand it is obvious that it is continued uncertainty and it does not resolve other than by postponing what would have been a terrible outcome because we believe that in terms of economic consequences the no deal brexit would have been a terrible outcome mr rice thank you madame lagarde i think there is a question from egypt yes ma am question first of all thank you for this conference and you all know that egypt has an extended fund facility from the imf so i need your opinion or your comments regarding the egyptian status the situation in egypt now and your evaluation according to the program and the second question is do you think that egypt needs a fund program thank you madame lagarde you know egypt has delivered under its program and i think that what is remarkable is that there has been real ownership on the part of the egyptian people who have made huge sacrifices in order to restore a more stable situation and in order to align the egyptian pound for instance with what we regarded and what the markets regarded as its real value relative to the economy we are getting close to the end of that program and we very much hope that the next review yet to come will be completed satisfactorily i have received assurances from president el sisi as you know whom i saw earlier this week with david lipton that they will stay committed in order to complete the program in order to deliver on their commitment and i have assured him that we remain available to continue to help going forward in order to maintain stability and in order to make sure that growth continues to support the egyptian economy to create jobs i have raised specifically the issue of the entrepreneurship of young people and how they need a space and the freedom to operate in order to contribute to the economic developments in egypt and he has offered that we help in that respect as much as we can mr rice thank you i will swing back around but staying with the mena region i think it is tunisia in the front row question an imf mission has just come back from tunisia what were its conclusions what will be the follow up and what message would you like to deliver to tunisia madame lagarde the mission has just come back and the tunisian authorities have just arrived so the work is ongoing i read the report from the team there are some specific points that remain to be mentioned such as pricing discussions will continue and will be finalized in the days ahead so that we can complete the tunisian program thank you very much mr rice bloomberg please question i am just wondering to what extent you are concerned about sort of this addiction that the global economy has and policymakers have to monetary policy stimulus it seems that you know markets were selling off very sharply in december then we got a pause in central banks across the board including the fed we are seeing in the u s more pressure on the fed to cut rates to what extent do you think the world is looking too much to central banks at this point madame lagarde we have repeatedly said that policies should use all the tools in the toolbox and that that should be done by the respective authorities in charge of those tools in our fiscal recommendation we strongly urge many countries not all but many countries to rebuild their fiscal buffers that is certainly the case with many of the developing countries it is the case in as i said in many countries not all those that are in a situation of fiscal surplus at the moment should certainly make use of it and have the space to invest and to participate in the economic development and growth but not enough has been done on that front and that is what markets are seeing so they expect that the only tool in town if you will is going to be for a long period monetary policies and as we have said as well monetary policy has been extremely efficient but has also not run its course but has as we stand now in many countries very low interest rates and not much room to maneuver unless they were going to explore yet again more traveling into negative territory and their balance sheets are quite large so our recommendation to monetary authorities is please stay accommodating for many of you facilitate the fiscal measures that need to be taken mr rice thank you md just behind bloomberg is reuters question good morning bonjour i would like to ask you about your thinking and the thinking of the shareholders on venezuela it has been a long time that you have been considering what to do and have been waiting for some clarity there what kind of changes from the situation now do you need to see in order to recognize juan guaidó as the leader of that country and to really start to get involved financially thank you madame lagarde well let me say first of all that we are really very very concerned about the humanitarian crisis that is unfolding in front of our eyes in venezuela and although we do not have information from the field in venezuela because we are persona non grata and have been for the last 15 years or so but we hear enough from our colombian colleagues and friends and from others in the region who are on the receiving end of that flow of refugees out of venezuela so this is a very high concern for us point number one point number two in terms of membership we are guided by our membership so it is for our members to indicate which authority they are recognizing diplomatically so that we can then follow through this is the way it has always worked at the imf so we are waiting to be guided by the membership and i know that it is in process at the moment as we speak from quite a few members and as soon as that happens we will as i said follow through number three we have done as much preparatory work as we could drawing on the information that is out there in order to be prepared to act as quickly and as swiftly as we can and it will require given the size of the humanitarian crisis and the massive economic crisis that the country is in a multitask and multipronged effort on the part of many we stand ready to do that as well mr rice thank you md i am staying please in the front row question good morning madame lagarde i wanted to ask you about the reform agenda the global policy agenda and two aspects one the debt transparency and your concerns about chinese lending especially in africa and other resource rich countries are you concerned that lending by china can create an actual debt crisis in those countries also you mentioned the reform of surveillance could you give a little guidance on what exactly you are looking to change or strengthen particularly with regard to currency policy and foreign exchange rates thank you madame lagarde on the debt issue as you probably know both the bank and the imf are working together in order to bring about more transparency and be better able to identify debt out there terms and conditions volumes and maturity and this is an endeavor that we will pursue together and which the g20 has actually asked us to develop so we are doing that number one number two we are constantly encouraging both borrowers and lenders to align as much as possible with the debt principles that have been approved by the g20 and that we have endorsed internally and developed ourselves it is clear that any debt restructuring programs going forward in the years to come will be more complicated than the debt restructuring programs that were conducted 10 years ago simply because of the multiplicity of lenders and the fact that not all public debt is offered by members of the paris club for instance which does not mean to say that any debt from a lender outside the paris club is an issue as long as the principles are adhered to the work that we eventually have to do with countries is then facilitated there is also a myriad of nonpublic lenders that complicates the matter seriously but that is another story in terms of surveillance and the comprehensive surveillance that we have identified it is a combination of two things it is one trying to harness all the competencies that we have focusing on delivery of services for a country to give you an example when we do an article iv which is clearly the typical bilateral surveillance product that we have with countries we are determined to organize us in such a way that we bring together the country teams the fiscal competencies the market and monetary policy competencies but also the capacity development programs that will be needed and helpful in order to deliver on the policy recommendations that we discuss with the authorities so it is sort of bringing in harnessing all the resources of the institution together on delivery of services for the country it is also leveraging on knowledge management on data analytical work that will be better leveraged by the technologies that we are currently assessing and for some of them already implementing so hopefully we will have speedier delivery more online services if you will to use you know sort of a common analogy and being all together as an institution on those services question on the currency madame lagarde well currency we constantly improve our external sector report i do not know if you have seen the latest format of it but it is published in a very respectable and high level way we will continue doing so and that is going to be part of the work that we continuously develop you know that we have moved from one particular model to another and under the leadership of david lipton it is work that is constantly under review and is probably the best that is available in that respect at the moment because it is a comprehensive system mr rice thank you md we will try to squeeze in just two more i think it is argentina way way over there on the right question good morning i wanted to know what your message is for the argentine people that are going through some hard times and face an election year and also what your message is for the argentine candidates the presidential candidates in terms of the continuity of the program with the imf madame lagarde all right on argentina i would like to give you two good news because we are now beginning to see the program actually work and our assessment is that the argentine economy is at a point where it is going to bottom out second i would say now that so much hard work has been done in a program where social protection has always been one of our three key priorities it would be foolish on the part of any candidate to turn their back to the work that is underway those are the two key messages mr rice thank you md the last question is going to go to japan right here in the center question thank you very much my question is about the modern money theory mmt madame lagarde it applies in japan as well question we do not have much inflation united states europe basically zero growth low inflation if we have low inflation we can have much more debt no problemo no problem how convincing is that theory to you is that ok to have more debt in the name of filling the gap between the poor and the rich thank you very much madame lagarde we do not think that the modern monetary theory is actually a panacea there are very very very limited circumstances where it could work we do not think that any country is you know currently in a position where that theory could actually deliver good value in a sustainable way so while it is tempting when you look at the sort of mathematical modeling of it and it seems to stand there are big caveats about it such as if the country is in a liquidity trap such as if there is deflation well then in those circumstances it could possibly work for a short period of time probably because interest rates stay low until such time when they start going up and then it is a bit of a trap so that would be our view all right mr rice merci madame lagarde madame lagarde see this is the international monetary fund mr rice thank you everyone we will see you over the next few days
washington dc thousands of delegates and officials have arrived in washington dc for the spring meetings of the international monetary fund imf and world bank which is taking place from 8 to 14 april the spring meetings of the boards of governors of the world bank group and the imf bring together central bankers ministers of finance and development private sector executives representatives from civil society organisations and academics to discuss issues of global concern including the world economic outlook weo poverty eradication economic development and aid effectiveness the sessions include the influence of macroprudential policies on household credit and spending export diversification debt vulnerabilities and development needs in low income countries managing capital flow as well as curbing corruption by improving economic governance in the middle east and central asia in addition the sessions also tackle the issue of illicit financial flows money and payments in the digital age cyber security as well as tackling the next wave of the sovereign debt crisis during the current year s meetings the imf expressed its concern regarding the decline of global economies growth calling on policymakers to adjust their policies by making changes to conditions which may occur and constrain their countries economic growth the imf managing director christine lagarde said on 2 april in washington that the global economy is experiencing a delicate moment with increasing risks to growth and an unsettled climate citing trade tensions tighter financial conditions and geopolitical uncertainty surrounding brexit and other events global growth has lost momentum she highlighted during a speech at the united states chamber of commerce only two years ago 75 of the global economy experienced an upswing so it was a synchronised growth acceleration and for this year we expect not 75 but 70 of the global economy to experience a slowdown in growth exactly the opposite of what we had lagarde said she added but just to be clear we do not see a recession in the near term in fact we expect some pickup in growth in the second half h2 of 2019 and into 2020 and indeed the global economy is at a delicate moment the expected rebound in global growth is precarious the expected rebound in global growth later this year and into early 2020 is precarious because it is vulnerable to downside risks including country related uncertainties such as brexit for instance and broader uncertainties such as high debt in some sectors in some countries tensions around trade policy are still uncertain and there is a sense of unease in financial markets for example there should be a sharp unexpected tightening of financial conditions it could create serious challenges for many governments and companies around the world in terms of refinancing and debt services particularly those that have borrowed in non domestic currencies which could amplify exchange rate movements and financial market corrections indeed it is a delicate moment in itself and it requires a delicate mix of policies the weo indicated furthermore lagarde urged policymakers to prepare for slower growth by making smart decisions in trade and fiscal policies additionally gita gopinath the imf economic counsellor and director of the research department stressed that policymakers need to work cooperatively to help ensure that policy uncertainty does not weaken investment now i don t want to be overly dramatic because we don t see a recession but we believe that because it is so delicate as it is filled with in a way with self inflicted wounds that only men and women can address that s why it requires this handle with care approach that brings together all domestic policies across borders and international coordination gopinath related according to the weo after strong growth in 2017 and early 2018 global economic activity slowed notably in h2 of last year reflecting a confluence of factors affecting major economies china s growth declined following a combination of needed regulatory tightening to rein in shadow banking and an increase in trade tensions with the us the euro area economy lost more momentum than expected as consumer and business confidence weakened and car production in germany was disrupted by the introduction of new emission standards investment dropped in italy as sovereign spreads widened and external demand especially from emerging asia softened elsewhere natural disasters hurt activity in japan trade tensions increasingly took a toll on business confidence and so financial market sentiment worsened with financial conditions tightening for vulnerable emerging markets ems in the spring of 2018 and then in advanced economies later in the year weighing on global demand conditions have eased in 2019 as the us federal reserve fed signalled a more accommodative monetary policy stance and markets became more optimistic about a us china trade deal but they remain slightly more restrictive than in the fall as a result of these developments the weo projected that global growth would slow from 3 6 in 2018 to 3 3 in 2019 before returning to 3 6 in 2020 growth for 2018 was revised down by 0 1 relative to the october 2018 weo reflecting weakness in the h2 of the year and the forecasts for 2019 and 2020 are now marked down by 0 4 and 0 1 respectively the current forecast envisages that global growth will level off in the h1 of 2019 and firm up after that the projected pickup in the h2 of 2019 is predicated on an ongoing build up of policy stimulus in china recent improvements in global financial market sentiment the waning of some temporary drags on growth in the euro area and a gradual stabilisation of conditions in stressed em economies including argentina and turkey improved momentum for em and developing economies is projected to continue into 2020 primarily reflecting developments in economies currently experiencing macroeconomic distress a forecast subject to notable uncertainty by contrast activity in advanced economies is projected to continue to slow gradually as the impact of us fiscal stimulus fades and growth tends toward the modest potential for the group the weo read growth across ems projected to stabilise slightly below 5 growth across ems and developing economies is projected to stabilise slightly below 5 though with variations by region and country the baseline outlook for emerging asia remains favourable with china s growth projected to slow gradually toward sustainable levels and convergence in frontier economies toward higher income levels for other regions the outlook is complicated by a combination of structural bottlenecks slower advanced economy growth and in some cases high debt and tighter financial conditions these factors alongside subdued commodity prices and civil strife or conflict in some cases contribute to subdued medium term prospects for latin america the middle east north africa and the pakistan region and parts of sub saharan africa in particular convergence prospects are bleak for some 41 ems and developing economies accounting for close to 10 of the global gdp in purchasing power parity terms and with total population close to 1 billion where per capita incomes are projected to fall further behind those in advanced economies over the next five years global energy prices declined by 17 regarding commodity prices global energy prices declined by 17 between the reference periods for the october 2018 and the current weo as oil prices dropped from a four year peak of 81 a barrel in october to 61 in february meanwhile supply influences dominated initially notably a temporary waiver in us sanctions on iranian oil exports to certain countries and record high us crude oil production weakening global growth added downward pressure on prices toward the end of 2018 since the beginning of this year oil prices have recovered somewhat thanks to production cuts by oil exporting countries prices of base metals have increased by 7 6 since august as a result of supply disruption in some metal markets more than offsetting subdued global demand following the tightening of financial conditions in late 2018 market sentiment rebounded in early 2019 signs of slowing global growth moderately less buoyant corporate earnings and market concerns about the pace of the fed policy tightening weighed on sentiment at the end of 2018 egypt s inflation is expected to reach 14 5 in 2019 12 3 in 2020 consumer price inflation remained muted across advanced economies given the drop in commodity prices for most countries in this group core inflation is well below central bank targets despite the pickup in domestic demand in the past two years in the us and the united kingdom it is close to 2 although wage growth has been picking up across most advanced economies notably in the us and the uk it is still sluggish despite lower unemployment rates and diminished labour market slack the weo projected that egypt s inflation is expected to reach 14 5 in 2019 compared to 20 9 in 2018 additionally the imf forecasted that the country s inflation will continue to drop to reach 12 3 in 2020 and 6 9 in 2024 global current account deficits and surpluses are estimated to have widened marginally in 2018 compared with the previous year higher oil prices have been the main driver of this widening they are estimated to have boosted the current account balance of oil exporters by about 3 5 of their gdp furthermore the imf s projection for egypt s current account deficit this year is to reach 2 4 of the gdp however it forecasts a decrease reaching 1 7 in 2020 and 1 in 2024
a year ago economic activity was accelerating in almost all regions of the world one year later much has changed the escalation of us china trade tensions needed credit tightening in china macroeconomic stress in argentina and turkey disruptions to the auto sector in germany and financial tightening alongside the normalization of monetary policy in the larger advanced economies have all contributed to a significantly weakened global expansion especially in the second half of 2018 with this weakness expected to persist into the first half of 2019 our new world economic outlook weo projects a slowdown in growth in 2019 for 70 percent of the world economy global growth softened to 3 6 percent in 2018 and is projected to decline further to 3 3 percent in 2019 the downward revision in growth of 0 2 percentage points for 2019 from the january projection is also broad based it reflects negative revisions for several major economies including the euro area latin america the united states the united kingdom canada and australia after the weak start growth is projected to pick up in the second half of 2019 this pickup is supported by significant monetary policy accommodation by major economies made possible by the absence of inflationary pressures despite growing at near potential the us federal reserve the european central bank the bank of japan and the bank of england have all shifted to a more accommodative stance china has ramped up its fiscal and monetary stimulus to counter the negative effect of trade tariffs furthermore the outlook for us china trade tensions has improved as the prospects of a trade agreement take shape these policy responses have helped reverse the tightening of financial conditions to varying degrees across countries emerging markets have experienced some resumption in portfolio flows a decline in sovereign borrowing costs and a strengthening of their currencies relative to the us dollar while the improvement in financial markets has been rapid those in the real economy have been slow to materialize measures of industrial production and investment remain weak for now in many advanced and emerging market economies and global trade has yet to recover with improved prospects for the second half of 2019 global growth in 2020 is projected to return to 3 6 percent this recovery is precarious and predicated on a rebound in emerging market and developing economies where growth is projected to increase from 4 4 percent in 2019 to 4 8 percent in 2020 specifically it relies on an expected rebound in growth in argentina and turkey and some improvement in a set of other stressed developing economies and is therefore subject to considerable uncertainty growth in advanced economies will slow slightly in 2020 despite a partial recovery in the euro area as the impact of us fiscal stimulus fades and growth tends toward the modest potential for the group given aging trends and low productivity growth beyond 2020 global growth is expected to stabilize at around 3½ percent bolstered mainly by growth in china and india and their increasing weights in world income growth in emerging market and developing economies will stabilize at 5 percent though with considerable variance as emerging asia continues to grow faster than other regions a similar pattern holds for low income countries with some particularly commodity importers growing rapidly but others falling further behind the advanced world in per capita terms risks to global growth while the global economy continues to grow at a reasonable rate and a global recession is not in the baseline projections there are many downside risks tensions in trade policy could flare up again and play out in other areas such as the auto industry with large disruptions to global supply chains growth in systemic economies such as the euro area and china may surprise on the downside and the risks surrounding brexit remain heightened a deterioration in market sentiment could rapidly tighten financing conditions in an environment of large private and public sector debt in many countries including sovereign bank doom loop risks building more inclusive economies given these risks it is imperative that costly policy mistakes are avoided policymakers need to work cooperatively to help ensure that policy uncertainty doesn t weaken investment fiscal policy will need to manage trade offs between supporting demand protecting social spending and ensuring that public debt remains on a sustainable path with the optimal mix depending on country specific circumstances financial sector policies must address vulnerabilities proactively by deploying macroprudential tools such as counter cyclical capital buffers a task made more urgent by the possibility that interest rates will remain low for longer monetary policy should remain data dependent be well communicated and ensure that inflation expectations remain anchored across all economies the imperative is to take actions that boost potential output improve inclusiveness and strengthen resilience there is a need for greater multilateral cooperation to resolve trade conflicts to address climate change and risks from cyber security and to improve the effectiveness of international taxation this is a delicate moment for the global economy if the downside risks do not materialize and the policy support put in place is effective global growth should rebound if however any of the major risks materialize then the expected recoveries in stressed economies export dependent economies and highly indebted economies may be derailed in that case policymakers will need to adjust depending on circumstances this may require synchronized though country specific fiscal stimulus across economies complemented by accommodative monetary policy lastly adequate resources for multilateral institutions remain essential to retain an effective global safety net which would help stabilize the global economy the

two hundred years ago just 3 percent of the world s population lived in cities today cities hold more than half of all people on earth the number of urban residents is growing by nearly 60 million every year a trend driven by rapid industrialization rural urban migration and globalization if this pace continues by 2050 over 70 percent of people will call cities home megacities pose the most dire development crisis of the 21st century wrong two hundred years ago just 3 percent of the world s population lived in cities today cities hold more than half of all people on earth the number of urban residents is growing by nearly 60 million every year a trend driven by rapid industrialization rural urban migration and globalization if this pace continues by 2050 over 70 percent of people will call cities home the largest of today s urban centers are known as megacities behemoths of tightly packed humanity each megacity holds more than 10 million people back in 1950 only new york city held that distinction today 24 cities do and at least a dozen more are expected to join the club by 2025 most megacities are and will continue to be in the developing world delhi jakarta shanghai and lagos to name a few it s easy to look at statistics and view megacities as the looming development crisis of this century the united nations estimated in 2006 that there was just one toilet for every 1 440 people in mumbai s dharavi slum in cairo meanwhile traffic has gotten so bad that a recent world bank report estimated that congestion costs the economy upwards of 8 billion each year in lost productivity seizing on these gritty details many journalists environmentalists and leaders of ngos and development organizations portray megacities as calamities vast open sewers that fuel a vicious cycle of poverty increase income and health disparities and degrade the environment ngos routinely highlight the worst of megacities and garner support for their work by telling stories of human desperation larger institutions like the world health organization emphasize figures such as the fact that cairo residents inhale the equivalent of a pack of cigarettes in air pollution each day on which the international media feed others are more direct in their criticisms joel kotkin a professor of urban development argued in a 2011 forbes article that megacities in developing countries should be seen for what they are a tragic replaying of the worst aspects of the mass urbanization that occurred previously in the west to be sure tens of millions of people in megacities do live in poverty and pollution but emphasizing megacities economic social and environmental problems discounts the fundamental opportunities they provide and the enormous capacity their residents possess the popular perception is in a word incomplete in fact the vast size and dense concentration of people and resources in megacities which currently produce some 14 percent of the world s economic output are their greatest assets they are tools that can actually be used to drive economies diminish poverty and empower residents making proper use of these tools is critical because mass urbanization is inevitable from europe to north america to asia no country has ever developed without it moreover the world has already seen how megacities can emerge and grow in a sustainable way in seoul for example infrastructure projects and economic reforms from the 1960s onward helped transform south korea from one of the world s poorest economies equivalent to modern day benin into the 15th largest becoming a global commercial hub transforming developing megacities and soon to be megacities will certainly take time and no two cities will transform in the same way seoul had highly centralized governmental structures that not all cities do especially those in poorer countries but there are other ways to leverage the power of density technology and economies of scale megacities hold enormous value for the developing world and ensuring that they deliver this value starts fundamentally with no longer seeing them as utter catastrophes megacities are too crowded sometimes bigger really is better decades ago paul ehrlich s famous book the population bomb offered an apocalyptic vision of an overpopulated planet subsumed by social upheaval starvation and mass death today most experts agree that ehrlich s concerns were overblown yet a similar argument is now being directed at megacities in 2012 wendell cox an urban policy expert wrote an article titled pakistan where the population bomb is exploding that highlighted karachi s massive growth in 2011 paul james then director of the global cities research institute told the economist that restricting the growth of cities in the sense of limiting their sprawling and bloating will overall improve the quality of life for humans on this planet existing and emerging megacities are big of course and growing fast which can make them seem chaotic and crushing to the western eye but big is not always bad to say megacities are too crowded doesn t make sense from an economic point of view indermit gill of the world bank s development economics unit said in an interview he explained that as countries develop people and economic activity always become more concentrated in urban areas this process of agglomeration economics is a good thing because it reduces production costs allows businesses to share infrastructure and provides large labor markets in megacities the scale of the phenomenon is even greater than it is in other cities already concentrations of cheap labor industry and markets in megacities and other urban centers heading toward mega status are vital to their countries according to researcher david satterthwaite mumbai contributes some 6 percent of india s gdp despite having less than 1 5 percent of its population in addition megacities have per capita gdps that are significantly higher than national averages the difference is even more extreme in developing megacities for example bangladesh s per capita gdp is 1 044 according to the country s bureau of statistics but dhaka s is more than 3 000 and these trends seem likely to continue emerging market mega and middleweight cities together are expected to contribute more than 45 percent of global growth from 2007 to 2025 consulting firm mckinsey found in a 2011 report bigger cities also better enable governments to deliver public services mckinsey has estimated that it is 30 to 50 percent cheaper to provide fundamentals like housing water and education in populated urban areas than it is in rural ones this helps explain why 90 percent of urban households in the developing world have access to electricity compared with just 63 percent of rural households governments should provide such essentials to all their citizens no matter where they live but in megacities they can often do so more quickly and efficiently as their populations grow megacities human density will eventually decline a natural progression in which residents get richer and new areas are built to accommodate them con sider glitzy satellite cities and suburbs of new delhi like gurgaon and noida as that happens however the importance of agglomeration manifests in a new way governments work to enhance physical mobility in order to keep people and resources closely connected governments in asia have been doing this for years developing high speed rail and other transportation options governments in other parts of the world are catching on dar es salaam tanzania is installing a rapid transit bus system and nigeria is building a high speed rail network to connect lagos with other cities governments in other words increasingly recognize that density pays and they are working to keep people in a tight urban embrace but megacities aren t benefiting people in slums in some ways they are it s certainly not news to say that within megacities the poor often live in slums eyesores of crowded shanties and trash in pakistan slum growth has accounted for nearly all recent urbanization in lagos slums hold more than 70 percent of the city s population u n habitat has called slums the most intolerable of urban housing conditions while books like mike davis s planet of slums portray the areas as post industrial wastelands some development experts have even called for them to be bulldozed and their residents relocated but though slums may not be desirable places to live a billion people call them home for good reason rural poverty rates are much higher than urban ones and people thus go to megacities seeking better lives slums are their gateways quickly absorbing migrants by offering cheap housing and informal work in close proximity this is especially true in africa south asia and latin america as edward glaeser author of triumph of the city puts it cities aren t full of poor people because cities make people poor but because cities attract poor people slums provide the first rung on the ladder of urban opportunity consider rio de janeiro where janice perlman founder of the mega cities project which researches urban management around the world began tracing the mobility of residents in the city s favelas in 1969 she found in 1999 that of the 36 percent of her original random sample group that she was able to locate 67 percent as well as 65 percent of their children had moved out of the slums 40 percent had become renters or owners of houses or apartments in other neighborhoods and 27 percent were in improved public housing those who remained in the favelas cited better access to public services and better household amenities over the survey period much of the economic opportunity that slums offer is through vibrant informal marketplaces typically every alleyway is a thicket of businesses and services barbershops food stalls clothing shops and more in mumbai s dharavi some 17 percent of structures are not actually homes but factories shops and offices many of which are thriving small scale leather textile and pottery factories in dharavi have an estimated annual output of over 500 million grassroots demand driven solutions to everyday problems also create opportunity in east african slums particularly those in kenya women without enough assets to obtain formal bank loans participate in merry go round systems in which they pool money together less than a dollar a week per person typically from which members can take loans these informal markets and networks often make living in slums more of a conscious choice than critics of megacities assume for this reason slum upgrading projects meant to improve people s lives by moving them elsewhere have routinely faced local opposition according to robert neuwirth author of shadow cities a billion squatters a new urban world in nairobi for example the government attempted to relocate several hundred residents and businesses of kibera the city s largest slum to new apartment blocks starting in 2003 but many people rented the apartments out took the cash and moved back to the slum where they had jobs businesses and social bonds that could not easily be replicated elsewhere this is not to romanticize poverty the creativity and entrepreneurship on display in slums should not preclude governments from taking a stronger interest and making larger investments in residents health and well being which are in dire need of improvement in nairobi s slums for instance child mortality is 2 5 times greater than in other parts of the city due to factors such as poor sanitation and minimal health care that said it is also wrong to write off slums as cesspools or to say that they just need to be cleaned up or torn down as glaeser argues slums are not a curse they are signs of a healthy city megacities can t be healthy because they re killing the planet in fact they just might be able to save it megacities are among many environmentalists favorite targets a modern tragedy of the commons critics point out that cities are responsible for 70 percent of carbon dioxide emissions and that while western megacities generally have efficient waste management emissions regulations and clean mass transit most in the developing world do not in beijing for instance air quality has become so bad that media outlets have started referring to the phenomenon as the airpocalypse scientist charles kolb who has studied megacity emissions said at the 2009 national meeting of the american chemical society that pollution from these urban centers make them immense drivers of climate change based on his presentation the society reported controlling urban growth in the developing world is key to improving the world s air quality yet megacities are greener than many people think and they can become even more so for starters large cities offer environmental benefits that rural areas do not across all developing countries 70 percent of urban households have access to modern cooking fuels electricity gas kerosene compared with just 19 percent of households in rural areas where heavy burning of coal wood and other biomass contributes to deforestation and air pollution as stewart brand an environmentalist and the founder of the whole earth catalog a guide to sustainable living has written n the developing world their greenness lies in how they take the pressure off rural waste recent data also show that as urban areas enlarge the growth rate of their emissions actually decreases ust like biological organisms the energy metabolism of metropolitan areas slows down as they increase in size larger regions burn less energy per capita than smaller regions the martin prosperity institute which studies urban issues reported in 2009 when people are closer together infrastructure and resource usage becomes more efficient larger cities have less road area per person more intense use of public transportation and shorter electrical transmission cables which means less loss of electricity and in turn lower co2 emissions according to the institute density also allows megacities to scale up green projects in a big way in the past decade several megacities have made buses taxis and auto rickshaws convert from burning petrol to using more environmentally friendly natural gas a policy implemented in dhaka bangladesh in 2010 has converted over 40 percent of the city s vehicles to natural gas reportedly averting 2 045 premature deaths from air pollution and saving an estimated 409 million around 0 4 percent of bangladesh s annual gdp sanergy a company in nairobi is installing thousands of pay per use toilets that will convert the city s human waste into productive assets cheap fertilizer for farmers and renewable energy from biogas that can help fuel the city s electrical grid and other scalable ideas abound according to a 2008 study from lawrence berkeley national laboratory if the world s 100 largest cities painted all their structures roofs white and used more reflective paving material it would offset nearly 44 metric gigatons of greenhouse gases this is because more reflective surfaces absorb less heat which can reduce overall urban temperatures and also lead to a decrease in energy use meanwhile slums green advantage lies not only in their maximum density and minimum energy use but also in their material resourcefulness in dharavi 400 informal recycling units and 30 000 ragpickers sort more than 6 000 tons of trash every day ensuring that almost literally nothing goes to waste in cairo similarly 70 000 garbage pickers support themselves by collecting trash door to door they recycle upwards of 80 percent of the waste they gather while most western garbage collection companies only manage some 20 percent nvironmentalists have yet to seize the opportunity offered by urbanisation brand has written but they should and soon it is time he says to green the hell out of the growing cities to seize opportunities megacities need clear tight urban planning throw out the blueprints while existing and soon to be megacities hold enormous potential for the environment for the poor for economies important transformations are still needed to ensure that they can fully deliver on their inherent promise to speed up these transformations of infrastructure and services among other things some institutions and economists offer prescriptive policies and top down planning recommendations many of these copy or at least draw heavily from western urban planning models the organization for economic cooperation and development for instance argues that policymakers need to look to places like the netherlands and embrace compact city policies high residential density little urban sprawl more radically paul romer of new york university s urbanization project has proposed building major cities from scratch called charter cities these would be independent urban free enterprise zones planned built and run in ways that economists and sociologists thought would be most efficient foreign investment guidance and advice are not necessarily bad but there is no one size fits all approach to megacities in the developing world and working from the bottom up is as important as working from the top down there are no historical precedents for such large cities explains alain bertaud a senior research scholar at new york university lagos mumbai and shanghai have to find their own solutions none of them can pretend to become one day successful blown up models of copenhagen or amsterdam finding better solutions begins with greater citizen participation satterthwaite argues that most policy decisions by international aid agencies and development banks are set up to support national not local governments thus they are not accountable to low income groups especially in urban areas as a better model satterthwaite points to the success of grassroots efforts like shack slum dwellers international a federation of urban community based organizations in 33 countries that interacts directly with local governments to improve basic rights and access to services for people in slums similarly as part of efforts to provide better sanitation education and other necessities to megacities poor populations governments as well as international agencies should seek to support and improve informal systems that citizens have already built rather than replace them with whatever is new and better there are numerous examples of how this can work since the early 1980s the community based orangi pilot project in karachi has trained activists mobilized local funds and invested over 1 million in toilets and sewer lines for more than 100 000 homes the work has been so successful that the government has invested an additional 8 million to connect the project s lines to the city s main sanitation network sao paulo meanwhile has incorporated informal recyclers into semiofficial cooperatives that operate around the city and other latin american cities have similarly integrated waste pickers into their official sanitation systems technology can also provide critical information about how megacities live and breathe and how they can be improved in kibera crowd mapping platforms are enabling residents to map schools pharmacies water taps and other essential landmarks through text messaging and gps enabled smartphones the maps have in turn helped ngos choose locations for things like new toilet facilities they could help nairobi s government do the same in cairo meanwhile bey2ollak a crowd powered traffic information app with around 1 million registered users allows commuters to post real time information about the city s traffic one local paper recently called the app more essential to traffic than traffic lights the government could use this existing data to better understand the city s traffic patterns and work with experts to develop new systems for managing the chaos megacities then already contain many of the ingredients for their future growth and change while governments may look beyond borders for some support their first stop should be with the people who know the nooks crannies and other intricacies of these cities best sadly megacities need governments that they ll never have that can change harnessing citizens input informal economies and bottom up innovation requires good governance and a deep concern among many development experts is that the relevant political leaders and institutions are often too corrupt or weak or both to get the job done romer and a colleague write that urbanization is peaking in places where the capacity to govern is still in short supply urban policy expert richard florida meanwhile writes that many of the world s megacities lack both competent governments and the money they need to govern effectively but the outlook isn t so bleak it s certainly true that managing megacities is incredibly hard says glaeser but it can be done well although political will sometimes embodied in exceptional leaders is an important ingredient here that will and the policies it leads to can be produced and shaped by everything from simple economics to social pressure moreover the private sector can play a critical role consider medellín colombia s second largest city it is considered a megacity of the future or megacity of tomorrow two decades ago medellín was a city of violence corruption and dangerous cartels today it has been called the world s most innovative city under the progressive leadership of mayor sergio fajardo the city invested heavily in parks libraries schools and affordable public transportation buses and cable cars targeting poorer neighborhoods according to one academic study a cable car system installed in 2003 linking poor areas on medellín s surrounding hills to the city s downtown below reduced the murder rate in those areas by 66 percent in just five years although he is a standout example the new york times called him nonconformist fajardo didn t emerge out of nowhere in the late 1990s he formed the citizens commitment movement an initiative of artists intellectuals and businesspeople focused on decreasing poverty violence and inequality he ran unsuccesfully for office in 2000 before finally winning in 2003 with wide support garnered over time from medellín s middle class and poor in other words the seeds of medellín s improvements were planted at the community level and cultivated over several years before finally blossoming in some cities businesses economic concerns have driven changes in governance in the late 1990s mumbai s private sector realized that poor infrastructure services and urban planning were hampering growth and limiting investment leaders in the sector along with the bombay chamber of commerce and industry formed bombay first a nonprofit initiative with the goal of making the city a better place to live work and invest in 2003 their work led to vision mumbai a report with recommendations for citywide improvements that have been endorsed by the local state and federal governments as well as the world bank bombay first now runs more than 40 urban improvement projects and government officials chair two of the organization s action committees enabling direct communication between the private sector and policymakers then there is nairobi where the government is making some urban planning decisions based on institutional self interest the city s transportation system has long been a nightmare a semiformal cartel driven fiercely competitive and chaotic mix of over 20 000 small and large buses payments for rides are cash based and split among owners drivers and conductors making the whole system rife with corruption and tax evasion to fix this nairobi s government is in the process of implementing new regulations stipulating that minibus drivers receive a basic salary and that vehicles be registered with savings and credit cooperatives by july 2014 all minibuses according to the government must be cashless using payment systems like smart cards and mobile money instead in addition to enhancing transparency and accountability once implemented the new system will help the government collect taxes theoretically to invest in better infrastructure better governance in both existing and emerging megacities can come about in many ways from political and nonpolitical actors and this ability to adjust and adapt extends well beyond governments down to neighborhoods economies and citizens while the world should not minimize megacities legitimate development needs it should view these cities as the resilient growing organisms that they are anything less would be to discount the profound and positive impact they can have in the 21st century

adjusted ebitda increased 4 4 yoy and adjusted ebitda margin ex ifric12 expanded 190 bps to 36 6 ceo message commenting on the fourth quarter 2018 results mr martín eurnekian ceo of corporación américa airports noted our results during the quarter continued to reflect the challenging macro environment in argentina our largest market passenger traffic growth showed further deceleration and total revenues were also lower impacted by significant currency depreciation in argentina and to a lesser extent in brazil the macro and fx environment contributed to the ongoing mix shift to domestic destinations and the resulting drop in commercial revenues in argentina by contrast in other markets we continued to make good progress in our commercial initiatives in italy we experienced a 10 increase in commercial revenues as we continued to enhance the customer experience in florence airport adding new retail stores and other commercial offerings the improving economic conditions in brazil drove an 11 increase in local currency revenues excluding one time items in both quarters and construction service margin comparable adjusted ebitda ex ias 29 declined 21 4 impacted by the difficult economic conditions in argentina as inflation in the country is catching up with currency depreciation reducing the strong operating leverage experienced in the prior quarter this more than offset the increase in adjusted ebitda achieved in the majority of our other countries of operations in brazil we delivered a 60 6 increase in comparable adjusted ebitda while italy reported 40 3 growth in adjusted ebitda 2018 was also an eventful year for us as we positioned the company for future growth on the financial front a key event was our initial public offering with respect to operations we served over 81 million passengers across our airport network up 6 year on year continued to add new routes and airlines and began operations at el palomar our newest airport targeting low cost airlines in argentina we also continued to advance our capex program in support of future traffic growth and to further enhance the passenger experience this included the construction of a new departure terminal at ezeiza airport in argentina expected to begin operations this year the start of the expansion of aeroparque airport and of regional airports in jujuy san juan comodoro rivadavia and iguazú among others another important event was the agreement we entered into with investment corporation of dubai whereby we will jointly identify and develop new opportunities in the airport sector in italy eastern europe and middle east moreover we extended by 5 years our concession agreement in ecuador we are also pleased progress made early this year with the conclusion of the environmental and urban impact studies and approvals with respect to our expansion plans at the florence airport aiming to meet unsatisfied traffic demand in the region and most recently with the 14 year extension of the concession agreement for punta del este airport in uruguay looking to the current year we see the difficult economic environment together with the added uncertainty of a presidential election year in argentina to continue impacting passenger traffic trends while the macro backdrop is anticipated to gradually improve in the second half given the lag between the purchase decision and the actual travel date a pick up in international traffic is expected to flow into our results early 2020 domestic traffic in turn is expected to continue improving during 2019 in brazil we expect to see the economy to continue its improving trend throughout the year more specific to us we remain focused on implementing our strategy and moving ahead with key capital investments key to securing future growth is the ongoing development of new routes and increasing frequencies along with further enhancing our customers travel experience although we face a number of headwinds again this year we are well positioned for when the macro environment improves in the meantime our healthy balance sheet enables us to continue investing to support anticipated long term

fees collected from other miscellaneous sources such as telecommunications car rentals and passenger services construction service revenue and cost investments related to improvements and upgrades to be performed in connection with concession agreements are treated under the intangible asset model established by ifric 12 as a result all expenditures associated with investments required by the concession agreements are treated as revenue generating activities given that they ultimately provide future benefits and subsequent improvements and upgrades made to the concession are recognized as intangible assets based on the principles of ifric 12 the revenue and expense are recognized as profit or loss when the expenditures are performed the cost for such additions and improvements to concession assets is based on actual costs incurred by caap in the execution of the additions or improvements considering the investment requirements in the concession agreements through bidding processes the company contracts third parties to carry out such construction or improvement services the amount of revenues for these services is equal to the amount of costs incurred plus a

this is ai generated summarization which may have errors for context always refer to the full article by saying the country never never defaulted on its loans the dof is being naïve at best and disingenuous at worst the historical revisionism never ends this time it comes from the department of finance dof which is drawing flak for signing onerous loan agreements with china in behalf of the duterte administration and the filipino people read how the philippines fell for china s infamous debt trap to quell public furor finance secretary carlos dominguez iii exclaimed the philippines has never never defaulted on its loans the philippines has not done it even in the worst time and the worst time was right after marcos dominguez also said the philippines has no history of defaulting on its loans so why are people saying now that we will default they have no faith in the philippines i have 3 rebuttals to those statements first data show that the worst time for the philippine economy was during the marcos regime not after it read marcos years marked golden age of ph economy look at the data second this is not a matter of faith in the philippines but in the officials who entered into those loan agreements third to say that the philippines has never never defaulted on its loans is to utter a blatant lie in this article i d like to unpack and debunk these attempts at historical revisionism debt moratorium in october 1983 in behalf of the marcos government then prime minister cesar virata and then central bank governor jaime laya flew to new york to talk to a group of private banks to whom we owed debts there virata and laya requested a 90 day debt moratorium on our country s principal payments due that year a debt moratorium essentially means a country is suspending repayment of its debts in part or in whole just as some degree of shame befalls any person who can t repay his or her debts so this moment brought us national embarrassment more importantly this meant the marcos government could no longer secure external funds on which our economy at the time had been overly dependent only the international monetary fund imf was willing to lend a helping hand by extending standby credit but only if the marcos regime pursued policies to stabilize the economy such as the devaluation of the peso vis à vis the us dollar after years of leniency the imf became especially strict on us additional funds from private banks the ones virata and laya met in new york also hinged on the philippines compliance with the imf s conditionalities thus making our compliance doubly crucial as the grueling negotiations went on the marcos government kept extending its original 90 day debt moratorium it was not until december 1984 that we signed an agreement with the imf to restructure our foreign debts and it was only in may 1985 that private creditors agreed to have our debt payments rescheduled hence what was supposed to be a 3 month debt moratorium lasted for more than a year clearly we came to a point where we simply could not repay our debts for this reason i find it ludicrous for the dof to insist that the country has no history of default one assistant secretary claimed that the adjusted repayment schedule was not tantamount to default but in response supreme court senior associate justice antonio carpio opined that mere suspension of repayment like declaring a debt moratorium is already an event of default if that isn t default i don t know what is why the debt moratorium but what made the marcos government default on its loans 1 colossal external debt first the scale of debt accumulated by the marcos regime was colossal in the span of just 5 years from 1977 to 1982 our external debt grew by a whopping 16 billion see figure 1 at the same time interest payments on our foreign loans skyrocketed because of tight monetary policies pursued by the us federal reserve figure 1 adapted from de dios gochoco bautista and punongbayan 2 depleted foreign reserves second while buried in debt the marcos government bled the central bank dry of foreign reserves especially of us dollars the orange bars in figure 2 show that in 1974 our foreign reserves were about half as large as our external debt but that proportion dropped to a mere 3 5 by 1983 and 1984 meanwhile the dashed line shows that in 1979 our reserves could cover about 4 6 months worth of imports but by 1982 our so called import cover plummeted to less than a month figure 2 the hemorrhage of foreign reserves came not just from lackadaisical exports but also more importantly from massive capital flight throughout the dictatorship from 1973 to 1986 around 11 3 billion worth of capital had fled the country adjusting for inflation without sufficient foreign reserves we simply could not repay our foreign denominated debts figure 3 worse the central bank concealed this depletion of foreign reserves from the filipino people in december 1983 during the negotiations the imf discovered that marcos economic managers had been overstating the amount of foreign exchange reserves in the central bank by about 1 1 billion or 50 this nasty revelation damaged the already broken trust of private creditors and the imf tarnished the already spotty reputation of marcos technocrats and derailed the already difficult negotiations 3 unproductive projects third and last the humongous debts obtained by the marcos regime were squandered on a plethora of inefficient projects both in the public and private sectors at the behest of then president marcos government owned banks like the development bank of the philippines and philippine national bank lent significant sums to the pet projects of marcos cronies even the central bank was called upon by marcos to make huge loans to corporations in complete contrast to its primary role as lender of last resort debt is not bad per se and in fact it could prove immensely beneficial if proceeds are put to good use but economists at the university of the philippines in a famous 1984 white paper found early on that the bulk of construction and other capital outlays in both the private and public sectors were not very productive and many were outright wasteful this made the so called behest loans largely uncollectable the enormous liabilities of the central bank left it essentially and paradoxically bankrupt historical revisionism the marcos regime saw some of the darkest moments in philippine economic history the most crucial events including the debt moratorium of 1983 the bankruptcy of the central bank and the country s worst postwar economic downturn are well recorded in a myriad of books articles and reports this is why the dof by saying the country never never defaulted on its loans is being naïve at best and disingenuous at worst some dof officials might do well to take or retake a course in philippine economic history lest they engage in further acts of historical revisionism god knows we already have enough of that to go around with rappler com the author is a phd candidate at the up school of economics his views are independent of the views of his

luxembourg business wire corporación américa airports s a nyse caap caap or the company the largest private sector airport operator based on the number of airports under management and the tenth largest private sector airport operator worldwide based on passenger traffic reported today its unaudited consolidated results for the three and twelve month periods ended december 31 2018 financial results are expressed in millions of u s dollars and are prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs as issued by the international accounting standards board iasb commencing 3q18 the company began reporting results of its argentinean subsidiaries applying hyperinflation accounting in accordance to ifrs rule ias 29 ias 29 as detailed on section hyperinflation accounting in argentina on page 18 fourth quarter 2018 highlights consolidated revenues of 371 0 million down 10 9 yoy excluding the impact of ifrs rule ias 29 revenues declined 12 8 yoy mainly due to lower travel demand in argentina reflecting difficult macro conditions and the fx impact in argentina and brazil partially offset by increases in ecuador and armenia growth across key operating metrics passenger traffic up 3 9 yoy to 20 3 million cargo volume declined 2 0 to 118 5 thousand tons aircraft movements rose 1 9 to 220 6 thousand operating income declined 42 2 yoy mainly impacted by ias 29 and the operating margin contracted to 14 0 from 21 5 in 4q17 adjusted ebitda was 90 4 million down 15 4 yoy with adjusted ebitda margin ex ifric12 contracting 276 bps to 28 6 ex ias 29 adjusted ebitda declined 18 6 yoy and adjusted ebitda margin ex ifric12 contracted 331 bps to 28 1 fiscal year 2018 highlights consolidated revenues were down 9 5 yoy to 1 426 1 million excluding the

adjusted ebitda margin ex ifric12 expanding 142 bps to 36 1 ex ias 29 adjusted ebitda increased 4 4 yoy and adjusted ebitda margin ex ifric12 expanded 190 bps to 36 6 ceo message commenting on the fourth quarter 2018 results mr martín eurnekian ceo of corporación américa airports noted our results during the quarter continued to reflect the challenging macro environment in argentina our largest market passenger traffic growth showed further deceleration and total revenues were also lower impacted by significant currency depreciation in argentina and to a lesser extent in brazil the macro and fx environment contributed to the ongoing mix shift to domestic destinations and the resulting drop in commercial revenues in argentina by contrast in other markets we continued to make good progress in our commercial initiatives in italy we experienced a 10 increase in commercial revenues as we continued to enhance the customer experience in florence airport adding new retail stores and other commercial offerings the improving economic conditions in brazil drove an 11 increase in local currency revenues excluding one time items in both quarters and construction service margin comparable adjusted ebitda ex ias 29 declined 21 4 impacted by the difficult economic conditions in argentina as inflation in the country is catching up with currency depreciation reducing the strong operating leverage experienced in the prior quarter this more than offset the increase in adjusted ebitda achieved in the majority of our other countries of operations in brazil we delivered a 60 6 increase in comparable adjusted ebitda while italy reported 40 3 growth in adjusted ebitda 2018 was also an eventful year for us as we positioned the company for future growth on the financial front a key event was our initial public offering with respect to operations we served over 81 million passengers across our airport network up 6 year on year continued to add new routes and airlines and began operations at el palomar our newest airport targeting low cost airlines in argentina we also continued to advance our capex program in support of future traffic growth and to further enhance the passenger experience this included the construction of a new departure terminal at ezeiza airport in argentina expected to begin operations this year the start of the expansion of aeroparque airport and of regional airports in jujuy san juan comodoro rivadavia and iguazú among others another important event was the agreement we entered into with investment corporation of dubai whereby we will jointly identify and develop new opportunities in the airport sector in italy eastern europe and middle east moreover we extended by 5 years our concession agreement in ecuador we are also pleased progress made early this year with the conclusion of the environmental and urban impact studies and approvals with respect to our expansion plans at the florence airport aiming to meet unsatisfied traffic demand in the region and most recently with the 14 year extension of the concession agreement for punta del este airport in uruguay looking to the current year we see the difficult economic environment together with the added uncertainty of a presidential election year in argentina to continue impacting passenger traffic trends while the macro backdrop is anticipated to gradually improve in the second half given the lag between the purchase decision and the actual travel date a pick up in international traffic is expected to flow into our results early 2020 domestic traffic in turn is expected to continue improving during 2019 in brazil we expect to see the economy to continue its improving trend throughout the year more specific to us we remain focused on implementing our strategy and moving ahead with key capital investments key to securing future growth is the ongoing development of new routes and increasing frequencies along with further enhancing our customers travel experience although we face a number of headwinds again this year we are well positioned for when the macro environment improves in the meantime our healthy balance sheet enables us to continue investing to support anticipated long term growth operating financial highlights in millions of u s dollars unless otherwise noted 4q17 4q18 ex ias 29 non ifrs ias 29 4q18 as reported var as reported

overview the s p 500 closed higher yesterday for the ninth session in the past ten but the coattails are short and global equities are trading with a heavier bias today a firm cpi reading in china took a toll on local shares with the shanghai composite shedding 1 6 the most in more than two weeks european bourses are mostly in the red after rising about 2 4 last week the dow jones stoxx 600 is off about 0 7 this week it has closed on old gap on the daily bar charts from april 3 and looks set to test the 20 day moving average another percentage point lower us shares are little changed bond markets are subdued the us 10 year yield has fallen five basis points over the past two sessions and pressured australian and new zealand yields lower the benchmark jgb was little changed with a yield of minus 6 bp the german benchmark is also little changed at minus 2 bp the yield of the us 10 year note is a basis point higher but still below 2 5 sterling has shown little reaction to the extension of brexit until the end of october it has been confined to less than a third of a cent range today which is the twice the range of the euro 15 ticks through the european morning the dollar has been confined to less than a quarter of a yen range while the australian dollar is in a fifth of a cent range asia pacific if the chinese economy is to find traction it needs to show that deflationary pressures are ebbing earlier today it reported a jump in cpi to 2 3 from 1 5 in february however the composition is wrong and that means that the cut in reserve requirements that we expect later in q2 is still on the table the rise in chinese cpi was due primarily to food the core rate was unchanged at 1 8 vegetable price pressures appeared to be weather related while the 5 1 rise in pork prices the first increase in two years was a function of the swine disease and herd culling producer prices ended higher to 0 4 year over year from 0 1 in february which also illustrates the deflationary pressures remain even if moderating slightly it was the first increase since last june when the ppi was 4 7 above year ago levels the australian dollar barely reacted to prime minister morrison s snap election call may 18 the liberal nationals are seeking a third term but party infighting and policy paralysis have seen labor run ahead in the polls for the last couple of years labor leader shorten is ahead in the latest poll by about four percentage points neither the election call nor the date is surprising speculators have been anticipating a more dovish central bank and a weaker australian dollar they have built a large gross short position in the futures market in recent weeks it has risen from 54 5k contracts a 100k each at the end of february to 82 3k contracts as of april 2 the weekly portfolio report from japan s ministry of finance is interesting japanese investors sold jpy1 7 trillion of foreign bonds last week it was the most since august and unwinds more than half of its purchases in the last two weeks of march we suspect that this is still part of the fiscal year end window dressing flows on the other hand foreign investors who sold around jpy4 5 trillion of japanese shares in march returned to the buy side in a big way they bought roughly jpy1 45 trillion of japanese equities last week the most since last october the dollar poked through jpy111 80 at the end of last week but pulled back the first three sessions this week and briefly traded below jpy111 00 it appears to be finding support in front of jpy110 85 where an 895 million option that expires today is struck on the upside the jpy111 30 area may offer sufficient resistance today to check the greenback the australian dollar reached 0 7175 yesterday its best level in more than a month it is in a tight range today consolidating its recent gains the short term technical indicators warn of the likelihood of another run at 0 7200 the chinese yuan has barely changed this week cny6 7170 it has not moved more than 0 1 net net in any of the week s four sessions europe after failing to get house of commons support for the withdrawal bill not once or twice but now three times prime minister may was compelled to seek an extension she requested an extension until the end of june and the eu27 granted until the end of october it is a shorter extension than what was previously floated by tusk and others there will be a formal review in june press reports suggest that macron insisted on the pressure of a near term deadline recall that after the uk decided to join the eu france fought it bitterly merkel seemed to also favor a relatively short extension the logic of the end of october may be that it is around when the new european commission will take office though of course few can resist the allusions to halloween may said that if an agreement would be reached by may 22 the uk would not have to participate in the european parliament election tomorrow was supposed to be the deadline to declare one s intentions october is also far enough away to buy the uk time to sort out what they want to do if it was much longer it would risk uk elections which would slow things down even further and potentially bring in a less competent and more strident prime minister that said it is not clear what is next for the uk may has reluctantly and belatedly reached out to labour but outside of staking out views little has been achieved the ecb did not appear to break new ground yesterday the economic risks were still on the downside and incoming data especially from the manufacturing sector continues to be weak draghi suggested some headwinds were easing but other temporary factors brexit trade uncertainty were lasting longer the december 2020 euribor futures contract saw its yield fall to match last month s contract low of 25 bp it is consolidating just above there today it has fallen ten basis points since march 21 the 1 1285 level corresponds to a fibonacci retracement 38 2 of the euro s decline since the march 20 high near 1 1450 the next retracement target 50 is closer to 1 1315 a 500 million euro option is struck just below there and will be cut today the intraday technicals favor an upside range extension today sterling is trading inside yesterday s range which was inside tuesday s range the intraday technicals also favor the upside initial resistance is seen near 1 3120 ahead of the gbp430 million option expiry at 1 3130 america we saw how euribor eased after the ecb meeting but the fed funds futures january 2020 was virtually unchanged after the fomc minutes it is unchanged on the week at an implied effective fed funds rate of 2 23 currently the effective average fed funds rate is 2 41 it had been flat at 2 40 from last december but turned a bit more volatility as the quarter end approached and remains slightly elevated through the interest paid on reserves a rate though apparently not perfect if our broad economic assessment is correct the softer growth in q4 18 and q1 19 will likely give way to somewhat stronger growth in the middle two quarters of the year and disinflation pressures also should ease other cross currents should also ease and the fed officials may have more confidence in the resilience of the economy when trump first suggested he would nominate moore a bombastic financial journalist to the board of governors of the federal reserve most professional economists howled however the white house has found a way to make moore s candidacy more acceptable it nominated cain who has even less support it would be unseemly for the senate to object to both candidates cain s candidacy was in trouble from nearly day 1 and it should not be surprising to see cain pullout of consideration the us reports march producer prices the year over year pace is expected to be little changed at 1 9 at the headline and 2 4 at the core even in the best of times the ppi is typically not a market mover weekly jobless claims will attract attention after last week s report showed a new cyclical low and 50 year low though qualifications have changed making long term comparisons risky canada reports new home prices they are likely little changed month over month and year over year housing market concerns are concentrated in vancouver where existing home sales are off by nearly a third and prices detached homes are off more than 10 and toronto where sales have fallen by 40 and prices by almost 15 mexico reports february industrial output figures the year over year contraction is likely to have extended into the fourth month but the month over month activity may have increased for the second consecutive month the us dollar briefly dipped below cad1 33 earlier in the week but it continues to find support near there the greenback is testing the 20 day moving average near cad1 3355 today at the end of last week after contrasting employment data it had been closer to cad1 3400 a return toward it should not be surprising the mexican peso has appreciated about 4 3 year to date making it one of the strongest currencies the dollar approached the low of the year mxn18 75 yesterday but found support ahead of mxn18 80 the peso bulls may step back and look to sell a dollar bounce toward mxn18 90 separately the dollar index is finding support by the 20 day moving average around 96 85

gita gopinath by indika sakalasooriya in washington dc although the growth in emerging markets and developing economies is expected to stabilise around 5 percent the international monetary fund imf this week warned that the materialising of any of the key global risks could derail the growth of these economies imf chief economist gita gopinath said flaring up of trade tensions between the us and china uncertainty surrounding brexit and a slowdown in systemic economies and regions such as china and eurozone could undermine the growth in emerging and developing economies if downside risks didn t materialize the global economy would rebound if any of the major risks materialise the expected recoveries in the stressed and high debt economies and export dependent economies may derail gopinath told the reporters attending the world bank imf spring meeting in washington dc on tuesday sri lanka s economy slowed down to 3 2 percent in 2018 as negative political development weighed on the economic sentiment which led to the final quarter of the year registering a dismal growth of 1 8 percent sri lanka is banking heavily on a combination of exports and foreign direct investment fdi to drive growth albeit both have so far not shown great promise exports grew under 5 percent in 2018 slower than the imports fdi scored a record year although the majority of it came as proceedings from the leasing of the hambantota port to the chinese meanwhile in its latest world economic outlook report the imf has cut global growth to 3 3 percent this year from 3 6 percent in 2018 though the multilateral lender expects the economic activity to pick up in the second half of the year and the growth is projected to return to 3 6 percent in 2020 the downward revision in growth reflects several negative developments in major economies including the euro area latin america united states united kingdom canada and australia gopinath said although the baseline projection for the emerging asia remains favourable the imf expects a slowdown in growth in 2019 for 70 percent of the global economy as opposed to a growth of 75 percent in 2018 this is a delicate moment for the world economy gopinath said while highlighting the importance of avoiding costly policy mistakes the washington based multilateral lender s optimism towards growth picking up in the second half appears to derive from the significant monetary policy accommodation by the world s major central banks the us fed european central bank bank of japan and bank of england have all shifted to more accommodative policy stance while china has ramped up its monetary and fiscal stimulus the imf also noted that emerging markets have experienced some resumption in portfolio flows a decline in their sovereign borrowing costs and strengthening of their currencies relative to the us dollar after almost 20 percent depreciation against the us dollar in 2018 sri lanka s rupee has appreciated 4 5 percent so far this year

tom friedman just noticed that the uk has gone mad part 1 william black by william k black april 11 2019 bloomington mn part 7a of the mmt series tom friedman s april 2 2019 column concluded the united kingdom has gone mad to which the only possible response is you just noticed the uk went mad 22 years ago when parliament elected the odious tony blair prime minister i think many tory policies were mad long before that date but the labour party opposed them the entire uk did not go mad until blair created new labour and adopted tory policies and became pm in 1997 blair explicitly modeled the name and the adoption of neoliberal economic and military policies on bill clinton and the new democrats the uk became mad when both of its major parties adopted the neoliberal economic and military policies that friedman celebrates and proselytizes i am dividing this article into two subparts for reasons of length this part deals with the general madness the next part 7b explains its relevance to modern monetary theory mmt friedman s april 2 2019 column was about brexit which understandably sticks in the craw of the populist spreader of the myth that the world is becoming flat and a hyper meritocracy the wealthy rig the world to make it tilt sharply plutocrats tilt it to ensure that a huge and increasing share of the world s wealth flows to them friedman is the most infamous shill for those plutocrats the plutocrats tilt and warp the economy unevenly to favor not simply the wealthy but a favored subset that is typically the opposite of a meritocracy kakistocracy worse the world tilts toward catastrophe because the ultra wealthy kakistocracy s political pawns have produced environments so criminogenic that they produce our recurrent intensifying financial crises friedman is shocked that one of the two epicenters of the global kakistocracy and plutocracy the city of london has forced the uk to follow policies so self destructive and rapacious that vast swaths of the uk rose in opposition by voting for brexit the city of london of course hates brexit friedman s column does not consider the data on the primary reason a majority of uk citizens voted in favor of brexit a policy he considers mad austerity was the decisive factor that changed the expected vote on brexit from remain to leave the linked article discusses what drove support for ukip that uk party s single issue was pushing brexit polling data confirms that these predominantly working class voters devastated by austerity were the key to the public s vote in favor of brexit welfare cuts and other austerity measures implemented under the conservatives pushed vital swing voters to back brexit and won the eu referendum for the leave campaign according to a new report research published by the social market foundation suggests the best indicator of a person s referendum vote was not age or education but happiness or sadness about their personal finances with unhappy people tending to vote leave and contented ones preferring remain the report which analysed the level of cuts in each area of the uk alongside each area s growth in support for ukip argues that had it not been for austerity the referendum would not have turned out the way it did it found that in districts that received the average austerity shock ukip vote shares were on average 11 62 percentage points higher in the most recent local elections prior to the referendum than in districts with little exposure to austerity as well as area level analysis the report looked at individual level data and found that some people directly affected by welfare cuts shifted their political support to ukip and rejected the political establishment households exposed to the bedroom tax increasingly shifted to support ukip and experienced economic grievances as they fell behind with their rent payments due to the cuts the paper stated as much as 9 percentage points of the 52 per cent support for leave around 3 million votes was decided by concern about austerity and related issues the researchers estimated it suggests that without the effect of the austerity shock on welfare and public services the leave share of the referendum vote could have been as low as 43 per cent delivering a comfortable win for remain austerity means that modern monetary theory mmt is relevant to the story mmt scholars protested against uk austerity and warned it would harm the recovery it did austerity always inflicts its harm unevenly it is an enormous economic advantage to the wealthy and a horrific burden on the working class and the poor in the uk context that meant that austerity made the city of london elites that did so much to cause and profit from the orgy of control fraud and predation that caused the great financial crisis gfc even wealthier while devastating huge parts of the uk inhabited by working class families control fraud and predation is a criminology term that describes what happens when those who control a seemingly legitimate firm use it as a weapon to defraud or predate on others friedman blair and clinton s four defining acts of madness why did friedman ignore austerity the uk went mad when tony blair championed four neoliberal policies that caused massive harm the three d s deregulation desupervision and de facto decriminalization the race to the bottom between the city of london and wall street to attract the biggest most fraudulent bankers the u s invasion of iraq in 2003 austerity in response to the great financial crisis gfc friedman infamously was among the most prominent cheerleaders for these mad policies friedman loves globalization and the most far reaching dominating and harmful form of it is global finance friedman has a mad view about financial crises and globalization in the lexus and the olive tree understanding globalization 1990 462 he admitted that deregulation and globalization would cause immense harm he was writing in the heart of the savings and loan debacle global financial crises will be the norm in this coming era he added to emphasize that point crises will be endemic emphasis added friedman was correct to admit that the policies he cheered would produce endemic financial crises what he did not discuss was the endemic financial crises costs he did not discuss how we should prevent the crises or respond to them when they occurred professor alexander field of santa clara university published a study in 2017 that estimated the u s cumulative output losses over the course of the gfc and its recovery as 41 7 trillion table i p 95 a trillion is a thousand billion the figure for the eu should be substantially larger because its infliction of austerity slowed its recovery the u s figure however would have been smaller had president obama not made his infamous pivot towards austerity and the grand bargain that he sought to negotiate with republicans to weaken the safety net it was really the grand betrayal of his campaign promises and the american people friedman does not want to discuss his praise of the three de s and the race to the bottom between the city of london and wall street that created the intense criminogenic environment in both financial centers and drove the control fraud and predation epidemics that drove the gfc friedman does not want to discuss his praise of eu austerity and obama s effort to negotiate the grand betrayal blair clinton and gore obama and friedman went mad long before obama sought to negotiate the grand betrayal consider friedman s admission that the trends he champions are certain to cause endemic global financial crises that is a mad trend we desperately need to reverse it the s l regulators contained the debacle before it caused any economic crisis but it cost 150 billion to resolve we did so by reversing the deregulatory trend the enron era frauds at peak caused a 7 trillion dollar loss of market capitalization and helped spark a moderate recession the gfc caused a 41 7 trillion loss in u s output a larger loss in eu output a global financial crisis and the great recession if the trend continues the endemic global financial crises will cause catastrophic harm what is friedman s policy answer to such a devastating trend friedman gives this sage advice in his column decrying the uk going mad what do the most effective leaders today have in common they wake up every morning and ask themselves the same questions what world am i living in what are the biggest trends in this world and how do i educate my citizens about this world and align my policies so more of my people can get the best out of these trends and cushion the worst what friedman describes and praises is mad it is mad to treat a trend as inevitable trends are the product of institutional factors that create incentives institutional structures the three de s plus a race to the bottom creates the perverse incentives that create an environment so criminogenic that it will produce control fraud and control predation epidemics so harmful that they will make global financial crises endemic the most effective leaders would never accept trends that were so harmful they would work on an emergency basis to end the trends producing endemic global financial crises similarly the trends on climate change are catastrophic it is mad to accept those trends we must urgently reverse those trends friedman pretends to be vigorous on climate but his own words demonstrate that he thinks the goal should be to cushion the worst harms he wants to allow a suicidal trend to continue that is mad effective leaders do not ask what world am i living in they ask what world should we make we make our world through the democratic process when we create our institutions and our rule of law when we create a criminogenic or predatory environment we ensure that fraud and predation will become epidemic and crises endemic it is mad to do so yet that is what we have been doing for nearly 40 years it is mad to continue a mad policy when we see it produce endemic and growing financial crises that cause catastrophic harm friedman is the world s most willing apologist for the plutocrats that create these perverse environments he celebrates their alleged brilliance and claims they are spurring huge gains in productivity data destroys his apologies productivity in the eu and the u s has fallen sharply during the period we have been making finance ever more criminogenic that of course is what economists and criminologists would predict thinking that by eroding the rule of law to the point that we have made global financial crises endemic is a good way to spur economic growth is mad austerity and public bailouts of fraudulent financial firms is however a spectacularly effective policy to aid plutocrats and kleptocrats friedman s heroes and their mad neoliberal policies made the world so criminogenic that global financial crises became endemic friedman s heroes and their mad decision to invade iraq was one part farce and twelve parts tragedy president bush of course leads the list of those who were mad when it came to iraq again the tragedy is that the leaders of both major parties in the u s and the uk shared this madness friedman was their most notorious cheerleader and apologist for their muscular military policies that invading iraq epitomized his mad policies 16 years later continue to cause immense suffering and disrupt the middle east friedman has a bro crush on blair so his trademark obsequiousness to powerful males reached nauseating levels in his writings about blair two years ago friedman wrote a column praising blair as the exemplar of the ideal leader but admitting that blair was enormously unpopular among uk citizens the uk public despises blair for championing the four acts of madness that produced the gfc a mad response austerity plus bailouts of the city s fraudulent and predatory bankers to the gfc that made it far more damaging particularly to the working class and the catastrophic invasion of iraq the uk citizenry also detests blair for his greed since leaving office in becoming wealthy by shilling for the world s worst dictators and for his hypocrisy in presenting that odious behavior as charitable yes he continued to copy bill clinton s tactics after leaving office blair got as wrong as it is possible to get wrong the six great issues he faced blair optimized the criminogenic policies that produced the epidemics of control fraud and predation that drove the gfc he responded to that catastrophe by bailing out the biggest and worst bankers and banks he failed to hold accountable those elite crooks and predators for their actions or even claw back their gains from fraud and predation he and his successor he chose created the self inflicted wound of austerity that further enriched the elites and impoverished the working class he championed and was the leading defender of the invasion of iraq he disgraced his nation after leaving office friedman s juvenile enthusiasm for muscular diplomacy invading other nations friedman ignores the reasons his nation despises blair except for blair s push to invade iraq and defending it even when the facts proved that the pretexts for invasion were falsehoods and the horrific harm of the invasion became evident friedman following our family rule that is impossible to compete with unintentional self parody presented blair in and april 22 2005 column as a martyr torched by an ignorant public for his courageous and principled championing of invading iraq by that date friedman knew that the pretexts for the invasion of iraq were falsehoods that the war had caused catastrophic harm and that invading iraq had harmed the allied efforts in afghanistan the invasion had failed to produce a movement to real democracy in the mideast a fantasy that friedman promoted it was a strategic gift to iran which friedman hates in deciding to throw in britain s lot with president bush on the iraq war mr blair not only defied the overwhelming antiwar sentiment of his own party but public opinion in britain generally blair risked complete self immolation on a principle noted will marshall president of the progressive policy institute a pro democratic u s think tank neither marshall nor friedman presented an honest principle one advances by invading another nation on the basis of fake facts and turning the nation you invade into a vast charnel house the u s and the uk lost lives and treasure and the invasion was a geopolitical blunder of epic proportions for the u s and uk friedman s claimed principle was actually despicable propaganda mr blair took a principled position to depose saddam and keep britain tightly aligned with america he did so among other reasons because he believed that the advance of freedom and the defeat of fascism whether islamo fascism or nazi fascism were quintessential and indispensable liberal foreign policy goals saddam hussein was many bad things but he neither a fascist nor driven by islamic views he was notoriously secular there is no such thing as islamo fascism that was a phrase invented by bigots to attack islam there are scores of anti democratic world leaders deciding to invade and liberate nations only when their populations were overwhelmingly islamic is the opposite of principle it is prejudice powered by propaganda friedman s april 22 2015 column had to abandon the lies that formed the pretext for the invasion of iraq there were no weapons of mass destruction wmd and iraqis government had nothing to do with the 9 11 attacks on the u s friedman was happy to supply new lies islamo fascism by 2015 friedman was at his most despicable and juvenile in sum tony blair has redefined british liberalism he has made liberalism about embracing managing and cushioning globalization about embracing and expanding freedom through muscular diplomacy where possible and force where necessary and about embracing fiscal discipline seriously real men gender intentional embrace muscular diplomacy we expand freedom by invading iraq in 2005 when he knew that the pretexts for the invasion were lies and the invasion had produced a catastrophe friedman enthused like a 16 year old boy about the masculine joys of muscular diplomacy invasion and chastised democrats for not being sufficiently enthusiastic about invading iraq heir own ambivalence toward muscular diplomacy cost democrats just enough votes in the american center to allow a mistake prone bush team to squeak by in 2004 the friedman doctrine is that democrats should have beaten the mistake prone bush by enthusiastically embracing bush s worst mistake invading iraq how did that sentence not sound mad to friedman when he wrote it friedman is the exemplar of our family rule that it is impossible to compete with unintentional self parody he reached his lowest level literally blasphemous in a march 16 2013 column claiming that blair invaded iraq in an act of selfless religious devotion to cure the ills of the world what does tony blair get that george bush doesn t the only way i can explain it is by a concept from the kabbalah called tikkun olam it means to repair the world if you listened to tony blair s speeches in recent weeks they contain something so strikingly absent from mr bush s tony blair constantly puts the struggle for a better iraq within a broader context of moral concerns tony blair always leaves you with the impression that for him the iraq war is just one hammer and one nail in an effort to do tikkun olam to repair the world i leave the disproof of this blasphemy to the reader the faux progressive faux think tank and faux growth the obvious question is what the progressive policy institute is that shared friedman s masculine joy about invading iraq a quintessentially anti progressive and mad policy it is the new democrats and new labour s anti progressive shop at all times blair copied clinton a 2015 guardian article demonstrated ppi s message discipline and its blindness to reality the ppi talisman was growth at columbia university in new york this weekend the progressive policy institute which helped bill clinton and tony blair pioneer so called third way politics in the 1990s held a closed door strategy session for congressional staffers that was designed to find ways of promoting growth there is no question that the prevailing temper of the democratic party is populist strongly sceptical of what we like to call capitalism and angry about the perceived power of the monied elite in politics said ppi president and founder will marshall but inequality is not the biggest problem we face it is symptomatic of the biggest problem we face which is slow growth al from a leading figure of the centre left who chaired the democratic leadership council during the first clinton presidency argues that a focus on inequality though understandable after the banking crash risks driving all candidates too far from policies that would promote growth culturally the country has progressed a lot and we are not going back says from who points especially to changing attitudes to gay marriage and women s rights but the question is whether a major political party can sustain itself solely on cultural issues and can have a real shot at governing if it doesn t have a growth agenda as part of its programme representative kind the head of the house caucus of new democrats and a strong hillary supporter was willing to give a quotation explaining that hillary was lying about her opposition to obama s trans pacific partnership tpp in order to deceive democratic primary voters i d lie if i said i wasn t disappointed with the statement that she made on tpp says representative kind everyone knew where she was on that and where she will be but given the necessities of the moment and a tough democratic primary she felt she needed to go there initially al from the long time leader of the new democrats was willing to quoted presenting an even more cynical illustration of new democrat realpolitik and another ode to growth paradoxically some new democrats may even relish a sanders resurgence pointing to the similar experience of ed miliband and jeremy corbyn in the british labour party which they claim will ultimately prove the folly of pandering to the left if we are going to be a governing party we have to but there is not going to be any pressure in the presidential process until we lose an election or two concludes from the new democrats problems include nominating their candidate hillary and losing to donald trump the bigger problem is that they think that we should tolerate extraordinary income inequality to promote growth what has happened to u s growth rates as inequality surged growth has fallen sharply epidemics of control fraud and predation cause real growth to become negative bubbles hide this reality by creating data that are nonsense but once the bubble collapses the real economic situation emerges the collapse eviscerates growth but the expansion of the bubble means allocates credit inefficiently which harms growth austerity gratuitously increases the lost growth the key to preventing this lost growth is an effective rule of law preventing the epidemics of control fraud and predation the new democrats and blair are terrible on each of these essential prerequisites of real economic growth bill clinton was exceptionally lucky in the timing of his presidency his supposed economic success was the product of the immense dot com bubble and the even larger housing bubble the housing bubble expanded throughout his eight years in office president bush continued clinton and gore s assault on the rule of law by making even deeper cuts in federal banking regulators and preempting state attorney generals efforts to stop the three epidemics of control fraud plus predation that drove the gfc clinton and bush made the same promise deregulation would spur a sharp increase in growth it did the opposite an effective rule of law and regulation is an essential aspect of that rule of law is essential to produce real growth when you strip away the bubbles you strip away the clinton and bush growth and see the reality

during the recent presidential campaign president andres manuel lopez obrador commonly referred to as amlo stated his intention to fund additional gasoline refining capacity for pemex the monopoly state owned national oil company it is expected that pemex will double its refining capacity by building a new refinery and by upgrading three of the six existing refineries to handle heavy crude oil which is the bulk of mexico s production overall imports of gasoline to mexico rose from 45 of consumption in 2013 to nearly 70 in 2017 increased imports were driven by a significant decline in mexican gasoline production attributable to a major contraction in production of crude as well as some reduction in refining capacity the united states largely filled the gap during the period 2013 2017 u s gasoline exports averaged 11 billion and supplied approximately 80 of mexico s gasoline imports assuming the new refining capacity comes on line in 2023 as planned u s gasoline exports could decrease by up to 4 8 billion per year since amlo s inauguration the mexican government has issued plans to spend at least 8 billion to build the new refinery with the cost of upgrading the three existing refineries estimated at an additional 3 billion the mexican congress in december passed the 2019 federal budget that follows up on those plans by including a first tranche of 2 8 billion in initial funding for building a new refinery and upgrading the existing three refineries in general subsidies to producers in one country that harm producers in another country may be subject to legal action while both the nafta and the wto agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures provide a legal basis for challenging subsidies to privately owned companies the united states mexico canada agreement usmca the recently signed but not yet ratified successor to the nafta contains provisions that directly address subsidies to state owned companies paragraph 4 of article 22 6 of the usmca provides that no party shall cause adverse effects to the interests of another party through the use of non commercial assistance to any of its state owned enterprises pemex is a state owned enterprise as defined by the usmca and federal funding consisting of grants to pay for new and expanded pemex refining capacity would constitute non commercial assistance both the stated intention and likely effect of the additional refining capacity is to reduce the volume of imports of gasoline in addition various market dynamics and relatively low refining capacity utilization rates in mexico raise questions about the economic viability of new refining capacity even though mexico signed the usmca on november 30 2018 containing a provision that would appear to prohibit subsidies for expanding mexican refining capacity it nonetheless took initial steps to provide such subsidies less than one month later but because the usmca has not yet entered into force litigation under usmca article 22 6 is not an option for any party who might consider themselves aggrieved the amlo administration is also taking actions directly affecting the downstream segment of the gasoline market although opening retail sales of gasoline to foreign investment and the liberalization of the retail price of gasoline were the hallmarks of the energy reforms implemented by the previous government the amlo administration has now reintroduced price controls on retail sales of gasoline in particular the minister of finance has announced that yearly price increases in retail sales of gasoline will be capped at the annual domestic inflation rate this policy could have profound implications for the profitability of foreign owned gasoline stations in mexico when the price of crude rises and or the mexican peso depreciates in a proportion greater than mexico s inflation rate the investor state dispute settlement provisions of both the current nafta and the usmca provide a potential legal basis for challenging these price controls it remains to be seen whether these issues will be raised by any government or private parties during the legislative consideration of the usmca and ratification processes in each country however the actions of the mexican government regarding expanded refining capacity and the failure to date to pass certain required labor law amendments raise questions about the degree to which other provisions of the agreement mexico just signed may be honored

summary since president donald trump took office attempted unauthorized crossings at the u s mexico border soared to the highest levels in over a decade the trade deficit rose by more than 100 billion 23 5 percent the economy added 5 1 million jobs unemployment fell to the lowest rate in nearly half a century economic growth picked up but fell short of what trump promised the number of restrictions in the federal rulebook stopped growing and fell a bit after tax corporate profits hit record levels stock prices rose carbon emissions which had been falling rose 2 percent at least 1 million fewer people have health insurance 7 million according to gallup one fifth of the judges on federal appeals courts have been installed by trump analysis this is our fifth quarterly update of the trump s numbers scorecard that we posted in january 2018 and have updated every three months most recently on jan 16 we ll publish additional updates every three months as fresh statistics become available here we ve included statistics that may seem good or bad or just neutral depending on the reader s point of view that s the way we did it when we posted our first obama s numbers article more than six years ago and in the quarterly updates and final summary that followed and we ve maintained the same practice under trump then as now we make no judgment as to how much credit or blame any president deserves for things that happen during his time in office opinions differ on that jobs and unemployment job growth slowed a bit under trump but unemployment dropped to the lowest level in nearly half a century employment total nonfarm employment grew by 5 121 000 during the president s first 26 months in office according to the most recent figures available from the bureau of labor statistics that continued an unbroken chain of monthly gains in total employment that started in october 2010 the average monthly gain under trump so far is 197 000 compared with an average monthly gain of 217 000 during obama s second term trump will have to pick up the pace if he is to fulfill his campaign boast that he will be the greatest jobs president that god ever created unemployment the unemployment rate which was well below the historical norm when trump took office has continued to fall even lower the bureau of labor statistics now figures the rate was 4 7 percent when he was sworn in the most recent rate for march is 3 8 percent it had been as low as 3 7 percent in september and november of last year that was the lowest since december 1969 the jobless rate has been at or below 4 percent for the most recent 13 months on record it hasn t been that low for that long since a 50 month streak ending in january 1970 the historical norm is 5 6 percent which is the median monthly rate for all the months since the start of 1948 job openings another reason employment growth has slowed is a shortage of qualified workers the number of unfilled job openings hit more than 7 6 million in november the highest in the 18 years the bls has tracked this figure as of the last day of february the most recent figure on record it was still nearly 7 1 million that s a gain of 1 463 000 unfilled job openings or 26 0 percent since trump took office for the first time on record the number of job openings exceeded the number of unemployed people looking for work in march of last year and in every month since labor force participation despite the abundance of jobs the labor force participation rate which went down 2 8 percentage points during the obama years has remained little changed under trump the labor force participation rate is the portion of the entire civilian population age 16 and older that is either employed or currently looking for work in the last four weeks republicans often criticized obama for the decline during his time even though it was due mostly to the post world war ii baby boomers reaching retirement age and other demographic factors beyond the control of any president since trump took office the rate has fluctuated in a narrow range between 63 2 percent and 62 7 percent it was 63 0 percent in march up just 0 1 percentage point from where it was the month trump took office manufacturing jobs manufacturing jobs increased under trump just at a rate slightly faster than total employment the number rose by 453 000 between trump s inauguration and march that followed a net decrease of 192 000 under obama the increase since january 2017 amounts to 3 7 percent compared with the 3 5 percent increase in overall employment the number of manufacturing jobs is still 920 000 below where it was in december 2007 at the start of the great recession economic growth the economy grew somewhat faster under trump but not at the rate he promised gross domestic product was 2 9 percent higher in 2018 than the year before according to the u s commerce department s bureau of economic analysis growth under trump has averaged far less than the 4 percent to 6 percent per year that he promised repeatedly both when he was a candidate and also as president the economy grew only 2 2 percent during his first year and 2 9 percent for all of 2018 according to the bea it spurted briefly to a 4 2 percent annual rate in the second quarter of 2018 prompting trump to proudly claim credit but it then fell back to a 3 4 percent rate in the third quarter and a 2 2 percent rate in the final quarter and growth seems to have slowed even further since then bea s first official estimate of growth in the first quarter of 2019 isn t scheduled to be released until april 26 however the gdpnow forecast produced by the federal reserve bank of atlanta projects that the first quarter growth rate will come in at 2 3 percent despite the 35 day partial government shutdown that ended jan 25 the congressional budget office has estimated that the shutdown shaved 0 4 percentage points off the annualized rate of first quarter growth most economists believe this year s growth will be less than last year s cbo s most recent economic outlook issued jan 28 projects real gdp growth falling to 2 7 percent this year and 1 9 percent next year and the even more recent median forecast of the federal reserve board members and federal reserve bank presidents issued on march 20 projects only 2 1 percent growth this year and 1 9 percent in 2020 other leading economists tend to agree that economic growth is slowing for the business and university economists who offered an annual gdp forecast to the wall street journal s monthly economic survey in march the average prediction was for 2 1 percent growth this year and 1 7 percent next year the national association for business economics march survey was only a little more optimistic producing a median forecast of 2 4 percent growth for this year and 2 0 percent in 2020 trump s gdp spin the white house website proclaimed economic growth has reached 3 percent for the first time in more than a decade but that s not true as we ve said growth fell just short of 3 percent when measured by the usual economic yardstick and even using trump s measure it grew faster than 3 percent less than four years ago the white house council of economic advisers issued a carefully worded explanation that growth was 3 1 percent later revised down to 3 0 percent if measured by comparing the final three months of 2018 with the same quarter a year earlier that s correct as far as it goes and it is also the first time since 2005 that this final quarter to final quarter measure was 3 percent or better as far as that goes but year to year economic growth is normally measured by comparing the gdp for all of 2018 with the gdp for all of 2017 that change was 2 9 percent as we have said and was just equal to the growth in 2015 only three years earlier furthermore the white house claim that growth was the best in 13 years rests on cherry picking only the final quarters of each year from bea s table 1 1 11 which gives the 12 month change in real gdp ending in each quarter and by that measure the economy grew faster 3 4 percent as recently as the 12 months ending in the second quarter of 2015 just three and a half years earlier regulations the growth of federal regulation has stopped under trump it wasn t exactly the sudden screeching and beautiful halt trump prematurely claimed back in december 2017 when in fact the number of federal restrictions was still growing but over the next several months the rise decelerated and then reversed the number of restrictions has now dropped to just below where it was when trump was sworn in the number of restrictive words and phrases such as shall prohibited or may not contained in the code of federal regulations went up by 0 73 percent during trump s first 15 months reaching a peak of nearly 1 09 million on april 6 2018 according to daily tracking done by the quantgov project at george mason university s mercatus center but as of april 9 2019 the number had dropped back below 1 08 million 864 fewer than on jan 20 2017 the day trump took office in percentage terms the drop is less than one tenth of 1 percent that small drop is a big change from the past restrictions grew at an average of 1 5 percent per year during both the obama years and the george w bush years according to annual quantgov tracking the mercatus count of restrictions doesn t attempt to assess the cost or benefit of any particular rule such assessments require a degree of guesswork and are sensitive to assumptions but it does track the sheer volume of federal rules with more precision than we have found in other metrics some of the recent changes are just clearing deadwood in march for example the internal revenue service removed 296 regulations that it said are no longer necessary because they do not have any current or future applicability and last year the treasury department scrapped an entire chapter of zombie like regulations issued by the old office of thrift supervision which oversaw the savings and loan industry before being abolished in 2011 s ls have since fallen under other federal banking regulators but the obsolete ots rules remained on the books however many of the rules trump has eliminated are quite significant within a month of taking office for example trump signed a law nullifying an obama era rule prohibiting coal mining companies from dumping waste into streams and waterways last year his administration withdrew obama s edict requiring automakers to double the fuel efficiency of new cars and light trucks to 54 5 miles per gallon by the year 2025 instead the requirement will be capped at 37 mpg starting in 2020 and in may trump signed a massive rollback of banking regulations easing rules for all but the largest banks crime crime declined during trump s first year and the downward trend accelerated in the first half of 2018 preliminary fbi statistics released feb 25 show the number of violent crimes went down 4 3 percent in the first half of last year compared with the same period in 2017 the number of property crimes declined even more 7 2 percent that followed a 0 2 percent decline in violent crimes and a 3 percent drop in property crimes during all of 2017 according to the fbi s annual crime in the united states report nationwide fbi figures for 2018 which include crime rates per 100 000 inhabitants won t be released until later this year likely in september crime had been rising during the two years before trump took office a trend he greatly exaggerated when he was a candidate during his campaign trump repeatedly and falsely claimed that the murder rate was the highest it s been in 45 years in fact the murder rate had dropped to the lowest on record in 2014 4 4 murders per 100 000 inhabitants and while it did rise for the next two years it was still only 5 4 per 100 000 in 2016 far below the peak rate of 10 2 reached in 1980 coal and environment coal mining jobs as a candidate trump promised to put our miners back to work but so far not many have regained their jobs a revised total of 35 600 coal mining jobs disappeared during the obama years but as of february only 1 900 of them had come back since trump took office according to bls figures the outlook for coal miners remains bleak the energy information administration currently estimates that u s coal production fell 2 percent last year and will fall 9 percent this year and by another 6 percent in 2020 eia expects natural gas will continue to displace coal for the generation of electricity carbon emissions carbon dioxide emissions from energy consumption are now going up under trump after falling for years figures from the energy information administration show co2 emissions fell by a total of 14 5 percent between 2007 and 2017 due mainly to electric utilities shifting away from coal fired plants in favor of cheaper cleaner natural gas as well as solar and wind power after trump took office co2 emissions fell more slowly at first by 0 8 percent in 2017 half the 1 8 percent decline in obama s final year and the trend has now reversed entirely emissions during the most recent 12 months on record ending in december 2018 were 2 0 percent higher than in all of 2016 eia figures put the increase in co2 emissions at 2 8 percent for all of 2018 compared with 2017 earlier the rhodium group a private research firm grabbed headlines with a preliminary estimate that the 2018 increase would be 3 4 percent but that was not supported by later eia data eia said the 2018 rise is due mainly to a hotter summer and colder winter that resulted in higher natural gas consumption it predicted that co2 emissions would fall by 1 6 percent in 2019 and 1 0 percent in 2020 if temperatures return to normal as forecast but even if those future reductions materialize it would leave a net gain in total carbon emissions since trump took office border security illegal border crossings are surging under trump to the highest levels in over a decade last month more than 92 000 people were apprehended trying to cross the u s mexico border without permission the highest monthly total since april 2007 that number dropped during trump s first few months in office hitting a low of 11 127 in april 2017 but the trend has been strongly upward since then and has lately accelerated for the most recent 12 months on record the monthly average was 48 672 which is 31 9 percent higher than the monthly average of 36 912 in 2016 we use this rolling monthly average for our chart because these monthly figures are subject to wide seasonal variations in the last three months however the number of unauthorized crossings has spiked even higher beyond anything seen in nearly a dozen years the monthly average so far this year is over 69 000 higher than the monthly average for any full year since 2007 of those apprehended in march less than one third were single adults rather 57 percent were part of family units made up of a child under 18 accompanied by a parent or guardian and nearly 10 percent were unaccompanied children border patrol officials said they are coming primarily from guatemala honduras and el salvador and many are seeking asylum it s a big change from the days when most such attempted border crossings were made by mexican males seeking work the border patrol is facing an unprecedented humanitarian and border security crisis said brian hastings the border patrol s chief of law enforcement operations we ve arrived at the breaking point hastings told reporters in a conference call april 9 that more than 11 000 detainees none of them with criminal records had been released into the u s because the border patrol lacks space to house them they were given notices to appear for court dates that could bring even more unauthorized border crossings in the coming months he said ord of mouth and social media have spread news hastings said and more immigrants are emboldened to make the dangerous journey corporate profits after tax corporate profits are running at record levels under trump during 2018 they hit 1 95 trillion eclipsing the previous annual record set under obama last year s after tax profits were 12 percent higher than the full year figure for 2016 the year before trump took office they also were 4 9 percent above the best previous full year figure which was 1 86 trillion in 2014 these annual and also quarterly estimates originate with the bureau of economic analysis see line 45 after tax profits got a boost in 2018 from the tax cut trump signed into law dec 22 2017 dropping the top federal tax rate on corporate income to 21 percent from 35 percent profits before taxes line 43 actually edged down by about one tenth of 1 percent last year and were 3 7 percent below the 2014 level stock market stock prices continued their long rise with trump in office though it s been a bumpy ride market indexes set record after record last year only to see much of the gain erased in the worst december since 1931 but that was followed this year by the best first quarter in a decade at the close on april 10 the standard poor s 500 stock average was just 1 5 percent below the record high set on sept 20 2018 and 27 6 percent higher than it was on the last trading day before trump s inauguration other indexes took similar rebounds at the april 10 close the dow jones industrial average made up of 30 large corporations was up 32 6 percent under trump and the nasdaq composite index made up of more than 3 000 companies was 43 8 percent higher than before trump took office the bull market began its rise in the depths of the great recession in 2009 and became the longest in history last year this year it passed its 10th anniversary in march wages and inflation the upward trend in real wages continued under trump and inflation remained in check cpi the consumer price index rose 4 3 percent during trump s first 26 months continuing a long period of historically low inflation in the most recent 12 months ending in march the cpi rose 1 9 percent the cpi rose an average of 1 8 percent each year of the obama presidency measured as the 12 month change ending each january and an average of 2 4 percent during each of george w bush s years wages paychecks continued to grow faster than prices the average weekly earnings of all private sector workers in real inflation adjusted terms rose 2 6 percent during trump s first 26 months ending in march after going up 3 9 percent during the previous four years those figures are for all private sector workers including managers and supervisors for rank and file production and nonsupervisory workers who make up 82 percent of all private sector workers real weekly earnings have gone up 2 5 percent so far under trump after rising 4 9 percent during obama s last four years in office consumer sentiment consumer confidence in the economy rose under trump then dropped back again the university of michigan s surveys of consumers reported that its index of consumer sentiment hit 101 4 in march of last year which was the highest in more than 15 years for all of 2018 the level averaged 98 4 which was the best full year average since 2000 but from there it slid to 91 2 in january exactly where it had been in september 2016 before trump was elected however the level bounced back in the most recent survey covering march hitting 98 4 that eased concerns of a future recession the survey s chief economist richard curtin said overall the data do not indicate an emerging recession but point toward slightly lower unit sales of vehicles and homes during the year ahead home prices and ownership home prices home prices soared to record levels under trump but recently have slipped back a bit the most recent sales figures from the national association of realtors show the national median price of an existing single family home sold in february was 251 400 earlier in june 2018 the median monthly price peaked at 276 500 the highest ever recorded the median for all of 2018 was 261 600 the highest full year figure on record but even though prices fell back in subsequent months the february median is still 22 700 higher than the median price of 228 700 for homes sold during the month trump took office a gain in value of 9 9 percent the rise in the consumer price index during the same period was 3 8 percent the realtors figures reflect raw sales prices without attempting to adjust for such factors as variations in the size location age or condition of the homes sold in a given month or year even so a similar pattern emerges from the s p corelogic case shiller u s national home price index which compares sales prices of similar homes and seeks to measure changes in the total value of all existing single family housing stock the case shiller index for january sales the most recent available was 10 5 percent higher than where it stood in the month trump took office whichever way you measure it homeowners have seen the value of their houses rise substantially since trump took office homeownership meanwhile the percentage of americans who own their homes has continued to recover from a years long slide gaining 1 1 percentage points since trump took office the homeownership rate began to slide after peaking at 69 2 percent of households for two quarters in 2004 it hit bottom in the second quarter of 2016 at 62 9 percent the lowest point in more than half a century and tied for the lowest on record the rate recovered 0 8 points before trump took office and has gone up another 1 1 points since then reaching 64 8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018 according to the most recent census bureau figures but it is still 4 4 points below the peak level of 15 years earlier trade the trade deficit that trump promised to reduce grew much larger instead the most recent government figures show that the total u s trade deficit in goods and services during the most recent 12 months on record ending in january was 622 billion that s an increase of 118 billion or 23 5 percent compared with 2016 china the goods and services trade deficit with china grew at a similar pace up by 22 8 percent between 2016 and the most recent 12 months on record ending in december when it hit nearly 379 billion trump last year initiated a full scale trade conflict with china imposing tariffs on 250 billion worth of chinese goods china has retaliated with its own tariffs on 110 billion of u s goods trump tweeted jan 8 that talks to strike a new trade deal with china are going very well but so far no deal has been announced mexico meanwhile the much smaller trade deficit in goods and services with mexico totaled 78 billion during the 12 months ending in december an increase of 25 8 percent compared with 2016 canada the trade surplus that the u s runs with canada has practically disappeared under trump the trade balance was positive by a scant 1 2 billion during the 12 months ending in december that surplus is 83 6 percent smaller than it was in 2016 on nov 30 trump and the leaders of canada and mexico signed a new trade agreement to replace the 25 year old north american free trade agreement which trump had promised to scrap during his campaign the new agreement will be called the united states mexico canada agreement or usmca the new agreement still requires approval by congress before it can take effect health insurance coverage the number of people lacking health insurance has risen by more than 1 million under trump and millions more are expected to drop or lose coverage this year the rise compared with 2016 was about 1 1 million as of the first nine months of 2018 according to the most recent report from the national health interview survey issued feb 27 the nhis said 9 2 percent of the population lacked coverage during the period up from 9 0 percent in 2016 a much greater rise was reported by a gallup survey covering the final quarter of 2018 gallup on jan 23 put the rise in uninsured adults at about 7 million compared with the last half of 2016 gallup put the percentage of uninsured adults at 13 7 percent in the october december quarter the two surveys aren t strictly comparable besides the differing time periods gallup covers only adults age 18 and over while the nhis covers all ages including children nhis said the 1 1 million increase it found was not statistically significant but taken together both surveys point to an upward trend that seems to have accelerated during the latter part of last year for more on these differing estimates see our feb 12 story did the uninsured increase by 7 million the nhis figure took a big jump from the data we reported in january when 100 000 fewer people were listed as lacking covering during the first six months of last year compared with 2016 the nhis doesn t break out the total number of uninsured people for each quarter but clearly there was a very large increase in the third quarter of 2018 the nhis estimate for all of 2018 is expected sometime in may and we will cover it in our next update trump failed to repeal and replace the affordable care act as he promised to do but did slash advertising and outreach aimed at enrolling people in obamacare plans in december 2017 he signed a tax bill that ended the aca s tax penalty for people who fail to obtain coverage effective this year and in march the trump administration joined an effort by gop state attorneys general seeking a court decision to overturn the entire act the nonpartisan congressional budget office estimated in may 2018 that with the end of the mandate penalty 3 million people will drop or lose coverage this year and another 2 million in 2020 food stamps the number of food stamp recipients has gone down since trump s inauguration as of january the most recent month for which figures are available 38 1 million people were receiving the aid the number has gone down 4 4 million or 10 4 percent since january 2017 when trump took office the number generally has been going down since peaking at nearly 47 8 million in december 2012 as the economy recovered from the great recession of 2007 2009 in december the trump administration issued a proposed rule that would tighten work requirements for able bodied adults between the ages of 18 and 49 with no dependents generally the rules limit aid to three months for such adults but many states secured waivers to that rule during the 2007 2009 recession and still have them in place despite a booming economy trump s proposal would affect only a fraction of all food stamp recipients however less than 9 percent of all people getting food stamps are classified as able bodied adults living in households without children and 26 percent of those are already working according to the u s department of agriculture judiciary appointments trump is putting his mark on the federal appeals courts more quickly than obama was able to do in his time in office supreme court so far trump has won senate confirmation for two supreme court nominees justice neil gorsuch and justice brett m kavanaugh obama also was able to fill two high court vacancies during his first two years in office with justice sonia sotomayor and justice elena kagan but the kavanaugh nomination to fill the vacancy created by justice anthony kennedy s retirement is significant because kavanaugh may move the court to the right he is considered more conservative than kennedy who sometimes sided with the liberal justices to provide deciding votes on issues including gay rights abortion capital punishment and affirmative action however kavanaugh disappointed abortion foes when he sided with the court s liberals on one of his first votes against taking up a case about whether citizens should be allowed to sue states that cut off medicaid funding for planned parenthood health clinics court of appeals trump also won confirmation of 37 u s court of appeals judges 30 during his first two years and another seven in the current congress as of april 9 that s more than double the total for obama who won confirmation for only 18 as of the same point in his first term 14 during his first two years and two more in the 112th congress as of april 8 2011 trump has now installed nearly 21 percent of all the 179 appellate court judges authorized by federal law district court when it comes to the lower courts trump has just pulled ahead of obama with the confirmation of the latest two judges on april 10 to seats on federal courts in texas and indiana he has won confirmation for 58 of his nominees to be federal district court judges nearly 9 percent of the 677 authorized district judges while obama had won confirmation for 57 at the same point in his presidency trump must share responsibility for this record with the republican majority in the senate republicans not only refused to consider obama s appointment of merrick garland to fill the supreme court vacancy eventually filled by gorsuch but they also blocked confirmation of dozens of obama s nominees to lower courts trump inherited 17 court of appeals vacancies for example including seven that had obama nominees pending but never confirmed federal debt and deficits trump inherited rising federal debt and deficits and his tax cut and spending increases are making both rise faster the federal debt held by the public stood at over 16 2 trillion at the last count on april 9 1 8 trillion higher than when he took office that s a 12 5 percent increase under trump and that figure will go up even more quickly in coming years unless trump and congress impose massive spending cuts or reverse course and increase taxes trump s cuts in corporate and individual income tax rates as well as the bipartisan spending deal he signed feb 9 2018 are causing the red ink to gush even faster than it did before the annual federal deficit for fiscal year 2018 which ended sept 30 was 779 billion up from nearly 666 billion the year before that s an increase of 113 billion much of the increase was due to reduced receipts from corporate income taxes which fell by 92 billion cbo s latest budget and economic outlook issued jan 28 estimates that under current law the deficit will continue rising for the foreseeable future exceeding 1 trillion annually starting in fiscal year 2022 baseline deficit projections are in table 1 1 line 30

higher shipments and pricing as well as cost management help martin marietta materials mlm to post solid first quarter 2019 results on apr 9 the international monetary fund imf reduced its growth forecast for the year once again the international lending body believes economic headwinds including monetary tightening by the federal reserve and trade conflicts could derail global growth in the months ahead the imf also cited industrial production data and surveys of purchasing managers to justify its projection for slower global growth in 2019 meanwhile even as china implements stimulus measures to boost its flagging economy the situation in eurozone remains worrying with a lurking global economic slowdown it makes sense to fortify your portfolio for such conditions in such an event demand for products and services generated by utilities consumer staples and medical companies remain invariant investing in stocks from these sectors looks like a smart option imf cuts global growth projections on tuesday the imf reduced its forecast for global economic growth for the third time in six months the international lending body now believes that global growth will clock in at 3 3 for 2019 0 2 lower than the estimate released in january however its projection for 2020 remained flat at 3 6 a major headwind for the global economy is the lingering trade war between the united states and china the imf thinks that the inability to come to an agreement and the resultant tariff barriers would result in higher costs of imported intermediate and capital goods and higher final goods prices for consumers and despite the federal reserve s recent attempts to step away from its earlier hawkish standpoint the imf thinks a change in the monetary stance of central banks could also imperil global growth the imf thinks that market expectations for the federal funds rate is well below the fed s projections according to the global lender this is likely to result in higher us interest rates renewed dollar appreciation and tighter financial conditions for emerging economies with large volumes of debt story continues global stimulus needed eurozone vulnerable speaking at a news conference in washington on tuesday imf chief economist gita gopinath said that this was a delicate moment for the global economy the imf believes that coordinated global stimulus measures would be needed to cushion the impact of a sharp downturn gopinath added that a dovish monetary approach would also be needed to counter the slowdown according to the imf most of the global economy s likely troubles this year will originate from problems in developed economies including leading members of the eu apart from the impact of an inevitable brexit other factors are impeding growth in the region the outlook for germany the eurozone s economic powerhouse has softened because of sluggish demand for exports and a decline in consumer spending tougher emission standards are also likely to weigh on sales of cars produced in the country our choices the imf s decision to cut global growth projections is likely to rattle investors across the world the risks it lays out while justifying this reduction are very real and likely to weigh on the pace of economic expansion in the near term investing in stocks whose demand remains invariant even during an all encompassing slowdown looks prudent

as investors appear to be awaiting the ramp up of earnings season with bank quarterly reports tomorrow they have some incremental geopolitical news to digest trade negotiations between the united states and china continue u s treasury secretary steven mnuchin told cnbc that the u s and china have pretty much agreed on an enforcement mechanism and the wall street journal reported that china has sweetened an offer to open its cloud computing sector to foreign investment in brexit news the deadline for the united kingdom to leave the european union has been delayed until october averting a potentially economically messy no deal exit that has been one of the geopolitical uncertainties hanging over wall street for some time still the news doesn t appear to bring the uk closer to actually figuring out a deal for the divorce much like the generally unsurprising fed minutes from yesterday the news doesn t appear to be moving the u s market too much as investors and traders are probably looking for resolutions to two of the thorny issues that have caused worries about global economic growth volumes have been on the light side recently as investors and traders wait for earnings season to ramp up in earnest tomorrow with big banks reporting quarterly results ahead of that it appears that market participants don t want to commit too much either way in economic news initial claims for unemployment benefits came in lower than expected at 196 000 versus the 215 000 forecast in a briefing com consensus that marked the lowest level for initial claims since october 1969 the labor department said when people are employed that can bode well for consumer spending which supports a huge chunk of the economy we ll also have to see whether strong employment trickles down to help the housing market mining the minutes yesterday each of the main three u s indices ended in the green after the minutes of the fed s last meeting showed pretty much what the market was expecting and reiterated the central bank s dovish stance the dovish pivot has helped the market move higher this year by allaying fears that monetary policy makers would be too aggressive in cutting rates even as inflation is muted now with softer economic data coming in and the fed having lowered its gross domestic product forecast for the united states the central bank has stood pat on interest rates and signaled that will continue a majority of participants expected that the evolution of the economic outlook and risks to the outlook would likely warrant leaving the target range unchanged for the remainder of the year the minutes said wednesday still the fed appears to be willing to rely on whatever data comes in with some central bankers striking a decidedly neutral tone saying they could go either way on interest rates again from the minutes several participants noted that their views of the appropriate target range for the federal funds rate could shift in either direction based on incoming data growth worries are global the dampened outlook on the economy echoed what s coming in from across the pond the european central bank held interest rates steady wednesday with its president citing slower growth momentum amid risks that are tilted to the downside but it appeared that the market paid more attention to the fed s more neutral stance than the ecb s more pessimistic view the ecb s statement comes after the international monetary fund cut its outlook for 2019 global growth on tuesday due in part to trade issues the fund now sees the global economy growing by 3 3 this year compared to its previous forecast of 3 5 a big reason for the dour economic prognosis continues to be the ongoing trade war between the united states and china which has affected hundreds of billions of dollars of goods from the world s largest economies on wednesday news on that front appeared to be promising but it was still generally in line with what the market has been expecting for some time and it lacked the punch of a really big breakthrough eye on the banks in corporate news bank executives were in washington to testify before congress but there didn t seem to be too many surprises there to move the market jpmorgan chase co jpm and wells fargo co wfc kick earnings season into higher gear friday citigroup inc c bank of america corp bac morgan stanley ms and goldman sachs group inc gs are all expected to report earnings next week the financials sector has been flagging in the face of a dovish fed and a slowing economy figure 1 oil futures rose after u s government data showed a large drawdown in gasoline inventories outweighing a larger than expected buildup in crude stocks the gains in oil prices come as people are expected to be driving more during warmer months and amid support from supply cuts from opec and its allies and u s sanctions on iran and venezuela data source cme group chart source the thinkorswim platform from td ameritrade for illustrative purposes only past performance does not guarantee future results inflation muted it seems that inflation numbers continue to play into the fed s hand although the headline consumer price index cpi increased 0 4 month over month in march a larger than expected jump and the highest increase since january 2018 inflation was much more tame when you take out volatile food and energy prices the so called core cpi which does just that rose only 0 1 which was less than the 0 2 gain a briefing com consensus had expected the key takeaway from the report is that the core rate of inflation moderated on a year over year basis to 2 0 from 2 1 in february which is a trend that should keep the federal reserve comfortable with its position of being on hold briefing com said resuming treasury buying while there generally wasn t too much unexpected in the fed minutes wednesday there was one point that seemed to stand out as a bit of a surprise it turns out that some central bankers want to resume purchases of treasury securities after the fed s balance sheet reduction program ends in september while the market has cheered the dovish pivot by the fed it s conceivable that the market might not welcome such a move which would essentially be another way for the fed to keep pressure on interest rates without an outright cut such a move might not be well received because the market probably thinks the fed needs to keep some dovish tools undeployed in case something unexpected goes wrong with the economy after all low growth combined with low interest rates can be challenging

part 1 part 2 part 3 part 4 part 5 the afl cio and democratic unions in latin america the record shows prieto and the american federation of labor congress of industrial organizations afl cio have been working closely together to channel growing discontent among workers on the border behind mexican unions partnered financed and in some instances created by the afl cio these efforts are being intensified in response to the resurgent class struggle which is rapidly turning into a rebellion against the mexican ctm labor federation and to the coming to power of a government aligned with the faction of the bureaucracy favored by the afl cio it is not only a question of creating a new façade for the trade unions but of integrating the mexican state and its political institutions more directly into the operations of us imperialism and to a lesser degree german imperialism while the initial impulse for the formation of the mass industrial unions in the us was provided by socialists and left wing militants in the 1930s and 1940s the merger of the cio with the right wing afl in 1955 was based on an explicitly anti communist alliance with the us ruling elite to crack down on the support for socialism among workers during the cold war afl leaders like george meany irving brown and jay lovestone collaborated with the war time office of strategic service oss and its successor the central intelligence agency in innumerable operations to subvert labor movements and counter the influence of socialists in europe asia africa and latin america following the war by 1961 the afl cio founded the american institute for free labor development aifld to expand these activities across the world the aifld was funded mostly by the us government through usaid which was founded the same year and later through the national endowment for democracy ned two products of the cold war operating as slush funds for cia operations under the slogan of the development of the democratic trade union movement in latin america and the caribbean the aifld trained unionists across the region as counterinsurgency assets to weed out radicalized workers and compete against trade unions led by stalinist organizations in 1969 the head of the aifld william c doherty openly told a senate committee that the organization was founded in cooperation with top capitalist magnates like david rockefeller and peter grace grace became the corporate chairman of the aifld and declared in 1965 as quoted by a 1974 pamphlet written by a plumber and member of plumbers and steamfitters fred hirsch denouncing these ties the aifld urges cooperation between labor and management and an end to class struggle it teaches workers to help increase their company s business to promote democratic free trade unions to prevent communist infiltration and where it already exists to get rid of it hirsch documents that aifld trained agents penetrated the leadership of several chilean unions like the chilean maritime federation comach and the cuproch that participated directly in the military coup against the salvador allende government in 1973 as well as in the bloody purge of radicalized workers and youth carried out by the fascist us backed dictatorship of augusto pinochet the junta outlawed unions but soon allowed the activities of 26 small unions tied to the aifld thousands were killed tortured and imprisoned and 200 000 workers were fired for political reasons aifld records for 1962 1972 indicate that 92 percent of its budget came from the us federal government the aifld backed the 1954 coup in guatemala and in the 1970s and 1980s allied with the death squads in nicaragua and el salvador so discredited was the aifld because of its complicity in cia coups and counter insurgency that by 1997 the new leadership of the afl cio changed the name of the federation s international operations to solidarity center but its operations on behalf of us imperialism continue the most recent report available for 2016 indicates that 93 percent of its budget of 32 million came from the us federal government according to national endowment for democracy accounts the us government agency assigned 704 000 to the solidarity center s operations specifically in venezuela during the five years prior to the failed venezuelan coup of 2002 in which the venezuelan confederation of workers ctv played a leading role this money was directly going into the coffers of the ctv under the pretext of supporting its highly successful internal democratization process the ctv has had long standing ties with the afl cio and is led by the right wing democratic action party that is co leading the ongoing coup operation orchestrated by the trump administration against the nicolás maduro government in caracas in mexico the afl cio veered away from backing the ctm in the late 1990s in january 1998 the new york times wrote approvingly that since the passage of nafta and mr sweeney s election to the afl cio presidency in october 1995 the american federation has decided to reach out to smaller and more militant mexican unions that for years have been persecuted here but are growing fast this decision was based on broad strategic considerations mexico had suffered a major financial crisis in 1994 triggered by the devaluation of the peso and the implementation of north american free trade agreement followed by the 1997 asian financial crisis the 1998 russian crisis and the collapse of the us long term capital management federal reserve chief alan greenspan expressed widely shared sentiments in ruling circles in early 1998 when he spoke of a visceral engulfing fear about the global economy globalization facilitated the transmission of financial disturbances far more effectively than before the crisis in mexico several years ago was the first such episode associated with our new high tech international financial system greenspan said the clinton administration intervened in 1994 buying pesos and approving billions in loans for mexico fearing that the crisis would seriously disrupt the us economy inflation unemployment and deeper social attacks against workers living standards provoked escalating social opposition to the ruling revolutionary institutional party pri and the ctm which is affiliated to the pri the death of the longtime leader of the ctm and the worker s council fidel velázquez in june 1997 and the july elections in which the pri lost its majority in the chamber of deputies for the first time led to an internal crisis in the political and union establishments unam historian javier aguilar garcía writes it became apparent that the ct and ctm as the main organs of mediation between the workers and power stopped functioning as corporatist organs in the country and particularly in mexico city the authentic workers front fat the stunam and other smaller unions claiming to be independent from the pri split from the ctm and ct and founded the national workers union unt in november 28 1997 about seven weeks later clinton s special adviser for latin america thomas f mclarty a businessman who founded an advisory firm mclarty associates in partnership with henry kissinger president nixon s secretary of state and one of the main orchestrators of the 1973 coup in chile arranged the first trip of an afl cio president to mexico for sweeney to meet with president ernesto zedillo his labor secretary and the unt leadership to back efforts to organize new unions in mexican border assembly plants and to change the fossilized labor system in the country according to the times one of the unt leaders sweeney met at the time the head of fat was bertha luján uranga who is currently the president of morena s top body the national council in 1998 there was a wave of wildcat strikes at maquiladoras near the border against the ctm unions including one at hang young by workers in tijuana which was directly mentioned by sweeney the wsws published a letter from a reader at the time reporting wildcat strikes by 13 000 maquiladora workers in matamoros and adding that us and canadian unions while careful not to mobilize their own members in support of their mexican brothers and sisters they are pursuing legal means in mexico and the us under the nafta treaty to break the ctm monopoly as the north american supply chains were becoming as closely integrated as the financial system the american ruling class feared that at a time of economic crises a wave of strikes led by rank and file workers outside of the straitjacket of the unions in mexico would quickly spill across the continent two decades later prieto and her pseudo left backers have played the key role in isolating wildcat strikes that threaten to spark such an upsurge all behind the promise of getting rid of the ctm a 2003 publication by the solidarity center on mexico noted that the ilo the us state department and ngos had identified the need to address the continued entrenchment of undemocratic unions not chosen by workers not representative of workers and not responsive to workers emphasis added clearly reflecting fears that the ctm had been thoroughly discredited the unt became demonstrably the closest partner of the afl cio in mexico when sindja was founded in 2015 with the support of the afl cio it immediately joined the unt that year the afl cio s solidarity center wrote in a report with the support from the solidarity center workers in mexico voted to form the country s first domestic workers union sinacttraho which also joined the unt at the same time gómez urrutia s miners union is openly affiliated to the american united steelworkers usw which is part of the afl cio along with industriall while the solidarity center reported in 2015 financing training programs for women union officials for gómez urrutia s union after the felipe calderón administration liquidated the publicly owned luz y fuerza in 2009 and ruthlessly fired 44 000 workers or two thirds of the membership of the electrician s union sme the union isolated and demobilized the resistance against the layoffs and the privatization efforts through empty solidarity campaigns and hunger strikes orchestrated with support of the afl cio and industriall once the privatized wholesale electricity market was set up by the peña nieto administration the sme became a bidder for the private market by founding fenix a company that it co owns with the portuguese multinational mota engil and employs 1 400 workers now a key backer of the privatization the sme general secretary martín esparza told the north american congress on latin america recently that many multinational corporations have entered the markets so it s extremely important that we have ties with unions in the us to work together to organize and improve the conditions of the workers in february 2014 the sme founded the new workers central nct stating in its founding documents its intention to organize with industriall which sent greetings to the foundation and to incorporate the unt both the afl cio and industriall made statements in support of the sme s new front with gómez urrutia the cit industriall which describes itself as the global union is dependent upon the german government much of its funding and assistance internationally comes from the friedrich ebert stiftung foundation fes which the union describes as its long standing strategic partner fes is run by the social democratic party spd of the ruling grand coalition in germany and receives its funding from the federal government industriall s german labor affiliate ig metall has long collaborated with volkswagen and other automakers in the slashing of jobs and living standards one of its leaders bernd osterloh the chairman of the joint works council of the volkswagen group is paid 845 109 16 million pesos per year or nearly 70 000 1 3 million pesos a month fes and the unt co host a trade union school in mexico lourdes hernández hernández and lorenzo rodríguez jiménez respectively the leaders of sinacttraho and sindja which susana prieto has been organizing closing with received this imperialist trade union training among leaders of other so called independent unions back in august 2015 the world socialist web site warned of the danger posed by these ties stating fearing the possibility that a rebellion against the ctm could lead to a radical upsurge of mexican workers which could serve as a catalyst for a unified movement of the working class across the north american continent a coalition of us and european unions have sought to construct free and independent unions in mexico based on the corporatist model of labor management partnership and explicit rejection of socialism and genuine internationalism since trump entered office promising a renegotiation of nafta the afl cio has pushed as it did in the late 1990s for the new nafta to demand labor laws in mexico encouraging a shift away from the ctm in a january 2017 letter the afl cio calls for the new deal to include enforceable workers rights in mexico while at the same time it spews out buy american rhetoric aimed against mexican and chinese workers in december 2017 the afl cio sent a letter to the us trade representative robert lighthizer demanding that he suspend negotiations with mexico unless it implemented laws favoring negotiations in good faith with independent unions the following month the afl cio and the mexican unt sent a joint letter to the us labor department with similar demands ultimately the promotion of these unions was incorporated into the new north american free trade agreement that still needs to be ratified by the us and mexican legislatures after the inauguration of the morena led congress last year the afl cio industriall and fes began organizing and financing lobbying efforts led by the sme and unt to implement a new labor reform favoring democratic unions based on the 1949 un international labor organization ilo convention no 98 on anti union discrimination in september morena pushed the ratification of this convention through congress in response to a tweet last september reporting a meeting between the sme unt and the morena president of the senate martí batres a worker tweeted unions here in the border tamaulipas are only good for taking weekly dues but not for the worker we are alone i don t understand why you want to impose unions on us since they never do anything when we ask for their help several drafts have been proposed for this reform including the one worked out by morena the unt and sme and presented on december 22 and another one on january 6 2019 proposed by the unt the essential feature in both is the requirement that unions demonstrate they represent the majority of workers disallowing protection contracts that hamper competition against the established company unions however legislators have no intention in annulling exclusivity laws that let only registered unions request strike authorizations and sign collective bargaining agreements on march 14 the president of the afl cio richard trumka visited mexico city for a high level meeting highlighting the conspiratorial character of this meeting the few news reports failed to even mention the presence of trumka who has made many statement s praising trump s america first nationalism others present included amlo s trade negotiator jesús seade kuri and prieto s ally napoléon gómez urrutia along with a large group of bureaucrats from the afl cio and canadian unions their purpose was to pressure for the approval of the new labor reform with gómez urrutia reportedly promising that it would be aimed at improving union democracy and freedom and be approved within the next legislative period on april 2 the speaker of the us house of representatives nancy pelosi told politico that democrats want to see the evidence that mexico s labor reform will be enforced before supporting the new regional trade agreement two days later amlo responded that his administration is pressuring lawmakers to approve the reform with reuters specifically indicating that the mexican congress s labor committee plans to pass legislation by the end of this month that would make it easier for workers to form independent unions to be continued part 1 part 2 part 3 part 4 part 5

recent reports indicate that a replacement for the north american free trade agreement nafta is on shaky ground in late september after months of wrangling the u s canada and mexico reached a tentative deal just before deadline called the united states mexico canada agreement usmca trade representatives lauded the agreement as a positive next step for the three countries usmca will give our workers farmers ranchers and businesses a high standard trade agreement that will result in freer markets fairer trade and robust economic growth in our region said the us trade representative robert lighthizer and canadian foreign affairs minister chrystia freeland in a joint statement at the time it will strengthen the middle class and create good well paying jobs and new opportunities for the nearly half billion people who call north america home but in the succeeding months the path to making usmca official the full text is here has been fraught with obstacles making passage less and less imminent lawmakers in all three countries must ratify it for it to become official for one trade tensions continue canada and mexico have asked that the u s lift its tariffs on steel and aluminum imports 25 and 10 respectively a holdover from last year that was not addressed in the usmca mexico says they re currently working on a list of u s imports on which they ll impose tariffs by the end of this month if the metals tariffs are not lifted there s going to be a bit of everything luz maría de la mora a mexican deputy economy minister told reuters last week though she didn t go into further detail the original list included bourbon cheese motor boats pork legs steel and apples canada is also considering a list of retaliatory tariffs and freeland has said they re collaborating with mexico on the issue he persistence of the steel and aluminum tariffs now nearly six months after heads of state struck the agreement takes away any sense of urgency wrote global capital market expert marc chandler at fxstreet a digital news outlet for the foreign exchange market canada and mexico seem content to continue living with nafta 1 0 if that is the alternative in addition to an ongoing trade row political disputes continue last week president donald trump pressured mexico to control its northern border long a corridor of drug trafficking and immigration into the u s with the threat of tariffs on mexican automotive exports however if for any reason mexico stops apprehending and bringing the illegals back to where they came from the u s will be forced to tariff at 25 all cars made in mexico and shipped over the border to us if that doesn t work which it will i will close the border donald j trump realdonaldtrump april 5 2019 this will supersede usmca likewise i am looking at an economic penalty for the 500 billion dollars in illegal drugs that are shipped and smuggled through mexico and across our southern border over 100 00 americans die each year sooo many families destroyed donald j trump realdonaldtrump april 5 2019 at the same time democrats in the u s who now control the house after mid term elections in november have threatened to block ratification of the usmca unless mexico improves workers rights a mandate with which the canadian government is also aligned usmca does require mexico to make changes to its laws when it comes to collective bargaining which has proven to be a complicated process however president andrés manuel lópez obrador ran on a pro worker agenda and in fact a labor reform bill one that addresses the long criticized union structure in mexico should be approved this month according to the government but house speaker nancy pelosi said the u s will need to see how labor laws in mexico are improved before considering ratification of the usmca trump has expressed frustration at the slow approval process and has threatened to pull out of the old nafta without an official ratification of the usmca unless congress acts canada and the u s are also feeling the pressure of upcoming elections prime minister justin trudeau will run for re election in october and trump in november 2020 additionally there are only a few weeks before canadian lawmakers summer recess in june after which they most likely will not return to the nafta issue until next year has his own election campaign to worry about wrote the toronto globe mail editorial board this week and doesn t want to appear too cooperative with a u s administration that imposed unjustified tariffs on canadian steel and aluminum as a pressure tactic during the nafta negotiations the editorial went on to state that when trump threatens to close the border with mexico he dampens the mexican government s enthusiasm for quick ratification of the usmca in the canadian promotional products market uncertainty continues particularly when it comes to pricing ratification delays combined with the additional tariffs and the fluctuations of the canadian dollar will have a dramatic impact on purchasing decisions by canadian distributors from american suppliers neil piitz president of differenciate consulting a canadian business consultancy for the promo industry told asi canada i have several clients that are suggesting to sales teams to buy what they can in canada at this point to try to avoid diminished margins this thought process will have a bigger impact on those distributors that are selecting product for program placement with client mandated price guarantees one canadian distributor buying more from within canada is toronto based ideavation asi 229801 which has had to make strategic decisions to mitigate the impact of recent trade uncertainty for example the retaliatory tariffs that canada imposed on u s products last year still stand and the list includes consumer goods that ideavation used to bring in from the u s like tablecloths and cocktail napkins we re not buying a lot of u s made goods now managing director scott hulbert told asi canada this week we ll have an order for an exact repeat of a tablecloth and now there s a 10 tariff on it combined with the weak canadian dollar we re smacked with additional costs and our vendors in canada are small and don t have the same capabilities hulbert adds that many canadians feel canadian and american leadership is making business more difficult particularly since the u s is canada s largest trading partner it s forcing me to limit my vendor base he says it s putting us in a position where we can t buy cross border if a supplier doesn t have an fob canada program there s just so much uncertainty order to order quote to quote as to what the cost might be the end users bear the brunt of the cost and it s a real issue for business growth but among all the uncertainty and frustration hulbert does see opportunity product manufacturing may come back in some capacity to canada as companies are forced to do less business with u s companies and he s also seeing distributors team up to overcome border challenges when possible u s and canadian distributors are looking to partner to fill orders he says i think we ll see more collaboration between small and medium sized businesses in particular which means more transparency and coming together so the border is less of an impediment

harbor statements today s call will contain forward looking statements and i refer you to the forward looking statements section of our earnings release and reconcilings with the sec we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements to reflect new or changed events or circumstances i also would like to remind you that following the categorization of argentina as a highly inflationary economy in accordance with ifrs commencing july 2018 we began applying ifrs rule ias 29 this rule applies directly starting january 1st of 2018 for comparison purposes in addition to presenting as reported results we are also disclosing the isolated impact of the adoption of hyperinflation accounting in argentina and our results excluding rule ias 29 additional information in connection with the application of rule ias 29 can be found in our earnings report note that for comparison purposes and a better understanding of the underlying performance in our presentation today we will be discussing results excluding hyperinflation accounting in argentina now let me turn the call over to our ceo martin eurnekian martin antranik eurnekian chief executive officer thank you gimena hello everyone and thank you for joining us today it s a pleasure to welcome you to corporacion america airports fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call i will begin my presentation with a discussion of the highlights of the quarter and then raul will take you through our financial results afterwards i will provide an update on our key business segments and overview for the remainder of the year we will then open the call to your questions starting with slide 3 2018 was a challenging year with travel dynamics and results impacted by the unfavorable macro environment and a sharp devaluation in argentina our largest market and to a lesser extent in brazil beyond these headwinds we served over 81 million passengers across our airport network up 6 year on year as we continued to add new routes and airlines and began operations at el palomar our new airport targeting low cost airlines in argentina excluding inflation accounting adjusted ebitda margin ex ifric for the year expanded 190 basis points to almost 37 and adjusted ebitda increased by low single digits looking at the fourth quarter specifically adjusted ebitda ex ias 29 declined almost 19 and margin ex ifric contracted approximately 330 basis points year on year impacted by the difficult economic conditions in argentina as inflation in the country is catching up with currency depreciation reducing the strong operating leverage experienced in the third quarter this more than offset the strong performance in other markets for example brazil delivered a nearly 61 increase in comparable adjusted ebitda excluding one time items while italy reported 40 growth in adjusted ebitda these good results were further supported by the majority of our other countries of operations with the goal of positioning the company for expected future growth and further enhance the passenger experience we continued to advance our capex program during the year during the fourth quarter we made capital investments of nearly 70 million with full year standing reaching 257 million investments were largely focused on our airport infrastructure mainly in argentina and italy key investments for the full year included the start of the construction of the new departure terminal and multilevel parking at ezeiza airport in argentina expected to begin operations this year and the start of the expansion of aeroparque airport we also undertook the expansion of regional airports including the jujuy san juan comodoro rivadavia and iguazu airports in brazil on the back of four new international flights announced by gol we ve made capital investments at our brasilia airport to expand the international boarding by its claim and duty free areas we also invested in the construction of runway safety areas let me take a moment to give you an update on our commercial project at brasilia airport we have redefined the project originally contemplated for this airport and are now planning a lower capital intensive model this new commercial space will be funded and operated by third parties with the airport receiving a percentage of the net operating income of the complex we have also been busy in italy we are particularly pleased with the conclusion of the environmental and urban impact studies and approvals with respect of our expansion plans at florence airport we are awaiting the final approval by the ministry of transport and expect to initiate works in the fourth quarter of 2019 we also started the expansion of the terminal building at pisa airport aiming to accommodate expected passenger growth an important event in the year was the agreement we entered into with investment corporation of dubai to jointly identify and develop new opportunities in the airport sector in italy eastern europe and the middle east finally in our other markets note that we have successfully extended by five years our concession agreement in ecuador which we executed last july additionally this month we extended for another 14 years the concession agreement in punta del este uruguay moving to slide number 4 traffic growth for the fourth quarter slowed to nearly 4 year on year mainly driven by argentina negatively impacted by difficult macro conditions and sharp fx volatility as already mentioned passenger traffic in argentina continued to decelerate up to 4 from almost 6 in the third quarter reflecting the overall slowdown in travel demand we also continued to see a mix shift in traffic with more affordable domestic travel up 12 year on year while international traffic declined over 8 in brazil traffic growth decelerated to nearly 3 year on year from over 5 in the third quarter italy posted a strong performance with traffic up 5 compared to 3 in the prior quarter the addition of new routes and airlines drove a pickup in international traffic more than offsetting the softer domestic travel demand in uruguay traffic contracted almost 3 year on year as performance remains affected by softer travel demand from argentina however we saw a seasonal improvement from the 5 drop experienced in the prior quarter traffic in armenia remains strong up close to 12 mainly due to the addition of new frequencies to destinations in russia ecuador continued to post a strong performance with traffic up over 7 reflecting the addition of new routes in the year while peru posted a slowdown in traffic growth following the suspension of operations of a low cost airline i will now hand up the call to raul francos who will review our operations and financial results please raul go ahead raul guillermo francos chief financial officer thank you martin good day everyone as gimena noted at the beginning of our presentation for a better understanding of our performance we will discuss our results excluding the impact of hyperinflation in argentina note however that in the fourth quarter 2018 the application of ias 29 resulted in a positive impact in reported numbers when compared to the previous accounting given that the indexation effect exceeded the translation impact from using the closing exchange rate as opposed to using the average exchange rate for the reporting period starting with the top line on slide 5 total revenue declined close to 13 year on year to nearly 363 million and 9 when also including construction revenues consolidated revenues were impacted by the mix shift from international to domestic traffic as well as lower travel demand in argentina revenues were also affected by the fx translation impact from the strong currency depreciation of both the argentine peso and the brazilian real aeronautical revenue declined 7 mainly due to weaker international traffic in argentina and currency depreciation in brazil by contrast we are very pleased with the results we are seeing in ecuador and armenia posting another quarter of revenue growth finally in italy traffic increase is not entirely reflected in the revenue line given that again this quarter marketing support expenses are deduced from revenues while in the year ago quarter they were included in sg a commercial revenue declined 12 4 year on year mainly reflecting lower demand in argentina and the fx translation impact in both argentina and brazil in local currency commercial revenues in brazil increased 15 benefiting from higher vip lounge and advertising revenues together with higher cargo volume in italy our initiative to enhance our service offering coupled with a higher traffic growth are showing positive result while armenia continued to perform well with growth mainly driven by higher fuel demand and prices coming to our cost structure on slide 6 this quarter we showed lower cost dilution particularly in argentina our largest market as inflation is catching up with the strong currency depreciation we experienced through the year the mix shift in revenues from international to domestic also contributed to lower cost dilution while cost of services ex ifric12 declined almost 5 year on year as a percentage of revenue we saw an increase of over 300 basis points this was mainly due to lower labor cost dilution arising from salary increases reflecting both growth in the employees base mainly in argentina inflation adjustments as well as higher maintenance cost sg a in turn was down slightly over 1 year on year but increased as a percentage of revenues impacted mainly by the increase in bad debt charges in brazil related to avianca brasil receivables partially offset by lower sale taxes in argentina sg a included one time items in both quarters ipo expenses in the fourth quarter 2017 and the write off of the commercial project in brazil due to its rest in the redefinition this quarter as martin just mentioned moving on to profitability on slide 7 adjusted ebitda ex ifric declined 18 6 to 87 million in the quarter growth in italy armenia and uruguay was more than offset by the weak performance in argentina and to a lesser extent in brazil in addition adjusted ebitda margin ex ifric contracted over 330 basis points to almost 28 1 from 31 4 in the same quarter of last year as we anticipated in our last earning call the strong margin expansion we saw in our previous quarter moderated as inflation is catching up with the currency depreciation in argentina reducing the benefit from the currency devaluation on cost in addition as i mentioned in the previous slide nonrecurring items in brazil also impacted the margin more details of these nonrecurring item is included in the earning release published this morning moving to the bottom line despite lower operating results our net income showed a significant increase due to a positive variance in non cash foreign exchange gains in argentina mainly arising from the us dollar denominated debt as the peso appreciated during the quarter this was partially offset by higher income tax expenses recorded in the quarter as shown on slide 8 we continue to maintain a healthy balance sheet that provides financial flexibility to continue developing our strategic initiatives total debt at the close of the quarter was relatively stable at 1 1 billion our net debt to last 12 months adjusted ebitda ratio slightly decreased to two times from 2 1 times in the prior quarter importantly we maintain a conservative maturity profile with around 10 of our debt maturing within the year and an adequate currency mix with about 60 of our debt denominated in us dollar 20 in reals and 14 in euros let me now turn the call back to martin who will go over performance at our key business segment and will comment on our outlook martin antranik eurnekian chief executive officer thank you raul starting with argentina on slide 9 revenues ex ifric declined 16 year on year despite the 4 increase in passenger traffic impacted by several factors we continue to experience overall slower travel demand along with a mix shift from international to lower priced domestic destinations this resulted in a 12 increase in domestic traffic and an 8 drop in international travel as the country is experiencing challenging macro environment we are seeing a sustained increase in activities from low cost airlines for example during the fourth quarter norwegian air argentina started local operations with five domestic routes while chilean local carrier jetsmart launched international operations from el palomar designated an international airport last october and fly bondi added routes to paraguay and punta del este at the same time aeronautical revenues from domestic passengers and the portion of our commercial revenues that are peso denominated remain affected by the fx translation impact from the sharp peso depreciation that took place in the third quarter we are also seeing lower commercial revenues from international passengers particularly in duty free revenues were also negatively impacted by the mix shift in cargo volume with higher export activity and the sharp reduction in higher margin imports against this backdrop adjusted argentine segment ebitda declined nearly 27 and ex ifric12 margin contracted approximately 514 basis points to 35 7 differently from the third quarter and as anticipated in our prior earnings call the impact from higher inflation on cost of services more than offset the benefit from the currency depreciation on our peso based cost as inflation is catching with the peso depreciation we continued to advance our capex program in the country and invested 56 million in argentina funds were mainly allocated to the construction of new departures terminal building and multilevel parking at the ezeiza airport the repayment of the runway and new terminal building at comodoro rivadavia airport the construction of the new terminal buildings in iguazu and jujuy airport as well as several other investments across other airports in our concession as i mentioned earlier our capex program is targeted to absorb future passenger traffic growth we continue supporting the government s airplane revolution plan and plan to invest between 250 million to 300 million this year to be funded with cash flow from operations this is in line with the capex program we are developing closely with the government now please turn to slide 10 for the discussion about brazil total traffic in brazil increased nearly 3 year on year although a slowdown from the prior quarter along with the gradually improving macro environment growth was supported by the addition of new domestic and international routes opened by gol in the fourth quarter of 2018 partially compensating the fleet adjustment at the leading latin american airline and difficulties at the brazilian airline local currency revenues were up nearly 12 year on year driven by the growth in both aeronautical and commercial revenues we are very pleased with the good performance in commercial activities resulting from the new commercial agreements and higher cargo volumes on a reported basis however revenues declined almost 5 impacted by the fx translation effect from the depreciation of the brazilian real adjusted segment ebitda in turn was down 80 to 2 million with the margin contracting to almost 6 from 27 in the prior year quarter this was mainly due to nearly 4 million bad debt charge in connection with a brazilian carrier and 3 million write off resulting from our decision to no longer deploy capital to construct the new commercial area at brasilia airport and instead develop a lower risk model as i explained earlier this was partially offset by lower sg a we invested over 4 million during the quarter for the expansion of the international boarding areas together with the construction of runway safety areas and engineering project at brasilia airport now moving to italy on slide 11 traffic trends remained strong up 5 year on year driven by international traffic growth comparable revenues ex ifric and excluding marketing support expenses remained flat in the quarter we posted a good performance at our new retail and duty free stores at florence airport as well as higher car rental revenues from new areas opened in november adjusted segment ebitda was up an impressive 40 and adjusted segment ebitda margin ex ifric expanded by over 526 basis points to 16 6 in the quarter we invested over 7 million in the quarter mainly for the expansion of the terminal at pisa airport and master plan development at florence airport now that we have concluded the environmental and urban impact studies we expect to obtain final approval in the next few months and to start construction of the florence airport expansion in the fourth quarter of 2019 now please turn to slide 12 to wrap up our presentation while 2018 was a challenging year marked by significant macro and fx volatility in argentina and to a lesser extent in brazil which impacted our results we continued to make progress on our strategic initiatives further strengthening our airport platform for when the macro environment improves looking to the current year we expect travel trends in argentina to remain impacted by the difficult economic dynamics in the country in addition to the added uncertainty of this being a presidential election year while we expect the macro backdrop to improve gradually in the second half of the year given the lag between the purchase decision and the actual travel date and overall pickup in international traffic trends in argentina is anticipated to flow into our results in early 2020 domestic travel is expected to continue to improve throughout the year as connectivity continues to increase in the country we also expect to see an ongoing gradual pickup in inbound international traffic as traveling to argentina becomes more affordable on the back of the weak peso but not fully offsetting the follow up in outgoing traffic by locals taking these factors into account we expect to see a single digit increase in total passenger traffic growth in argentina for the year by contrast in brazil we expect to see the economy continue its improving trend with traffic growth continuing throughout the year this is mainly the case for international passenger traffic which is benefiting from the recent opening of international routes we see a similar positive trend in italy complemented by solid traffic trends in our other markets we remain fully committed to elevating the travel experience across our airports developing new routes and frequencies while continuing to establish infrastructure mainly in argentina and italy and further strengthening our global platform for our long term success this is the end of our prepared remarks we are now ready to take questions operator please open the line for questions questions and answers operator we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions and our first question today comes from roberto otero with bank of america please go ahead peter bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi gentlemen actually this is peter ph here thanks for taking my question i have one quick question from our side and i ll move folks on aa2000 could you give us any update on the ongoing negotiation with the government regrading the concession 10 years extension and i mean in your view how should the upcoming election part impact the renegotiation right and if you could give us a sense of timing should we expect any final terms happening still in 2019 or maybe it ll be more conservative to assume this is happening all in 2020 onwards that s my question thanks martin antranik eurnekian chief executive officer hello this is martin and again thank you for your question it would be difficult for me to give you an idea on when the government will be ready we are engaging with them as often as possible to understand when can we officially launch a negotiation to be honest the fact that we have entered the election mode in argentina has at least in our perception shifted the administration s priorities in terms of what they need to achieve because as you probably understand everybody goes into election mode once we start getting closer to the primaries and presidential elections so this is the feel that i can give you although not impossible to do a negotiation this year i think that the fact that everybody is focusing on elections puts a little bit of strain in that possibility of being able to really close before the end of the year peter bank of america merrill lynch analyst all right martin thanks for respond my question operator and our next question comes from ian zaffino with oppenheimer please go ahead with your question mark zhang oppenheimer co analyst good morning guys this is mark on for ian thanks for taking our question so if you guys could provide a little bit more detail on the sort of the time line of the capital spend particularly at aa2000 be much appreciated so just a couple give us i guess like potentially give us a sense of when ezeiza will open in 2019 or just like first half or second half events and what s sort of the time line on the aeroparque expansion that ll be much appreciated thank you martin antranik eurnekian chief executive officer okay we have a set of inauguration set mark for this year ezeiza being the main one the set as of today the set date for inauguration of the new terminal in ezeiza is the end of september but that will be fine tuned with the group that is doing the actual capex and the government as well for the rest we have a calendar for opening of the works that we have been doing so far and we can definitely provide that to you but it will be publicly announced each time we decide on exact date for the openings that we have this year mark zhang oppenheimer co analyst okay terrific that s very helpful okay great okay great thank you guys very much operator operator instructions and our next question comes from bruno amorim with goldman sachs please go ahead bruno amorim goldman sachs analyst yes hi good morning i have two questions so the first one is out of the additional 1 billion in capex expected to be included in the concession agreement in argentina how much have you already done so far and also has the regulator recognized or authorized this investment or is it something to be discussed only when the additional 1 billion is approved by the regulator and the second question is when should we expect to see the next tariff revision in argentina is this negotiation tied with the discussion around concession renewal and additional investments for 1 billion or are those separate discussions could we see tariffs being adjusted before the final decision on the extension so those are my two questions please martin antranik eurnekian chief executive officer thank you first the two things are totally separate according to our current contract the tariff revision should be done yearly the regulator is a little bit late as far as we know and for the interaction we have they are getting ready to finish the exercise to be able to publish it it s not a negotiation they have to run the numbers and do the adjustments so it s not linked to any negotiation or anything else whatsoever regarding the capex question as the discussion we are having end of 2018 we were either at the number agreed in the concession contract in terms of total capex for the concession or a little bit or slightly beyond that number so for 2018 that is a fact for 2019 is where we are going beyond that number but everything we do is approved by the regulator and taken into account into the regulatory incumbency in the concession contract bruno amorim goldman sachs analyst very clear thank you very much operator and this will conclude our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to martin eurnekian for any closing remarks martin antranik eurnekian chief executive officer well thank you very much for joining us today we really appreciate your interest in our company we look forward to meeting more of

harbor statements today s call will contain forward looking statements and i refer you to the forward looking statements section of our earnings release and reconcilings with the sec we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements to reflect new or changed events or circumstances i also would like to remind you that following the categorization of argentina as a highly inflationary economy in accordance with ifrs commencing july 2018 we began applying ifrs rule ias 29 this rule applies directly starting january 1st of 2018 for comparison purposes in addition to presenting as reported results we are also disclosing the isolated impact of the adoption of hyperinflation accounting in argentina and our results excluding rule ias 29 additional information in connection with the application of rule ias 29 can be found in our earnings report note that for comparison purposes and a better understanding of the underlying performance in our presentation today we will be discussing results excluding hyperinflation accounting in argentina now let me turn the call over to our ceo martin eurnekian martin antranik eurnekian chief executive officer thank you gimena hello everyone and thank you for joining us today it s a pleasure to welcome you to corporacion america airports fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call i will begin my presentation with a discussion of the highlights of the quarter and then raul will take you through our financial results afterwards i will provide an update on our key business segments and overview for the remainder of the year we will then open the call to your questions starting with slide 3 2018 was a challenging year with travel dynamics and results impacted by the unfavorable macro environment and a sharp devaluation in argentina our largest market and to a lesser extent in brazil beyond these headwinds we served over 81 million passengers across our airport network up 6 year on year as we continued to add new routes and airlines and began operations at el palomar our new airport targeting low cost airlines in argentina excluding inflation accounting adjusted ebitda margin ex ifric for the year expanded 190 basis points to almost 37 and adjusted ebitda increased by low single digits looking at the fourth quarter specifically adjusted ebitda ex ias 29 declined almost 19 and margin ex ifric contracted approximately 330 basis points year on year impacted by the difficult economic conditions in argentina as inflation in the country is catching up with currency depreciation reducing the strong operating leverage experienced in the third quarter this more than offset the strong performance in other markets for example brazil delivered a nearly 61 increase in comparable adjusted ebitda excluding one time items while italy reported 40 growth in adjusted ebitda these good results were further supported by the majority of our other countries of operations with the goal of positioning the company for expected future growth and further enhance the passenger experience we continued to advance our capex program during the year during the fourth quarter we made capital investments of nearly 70 million with full year standing reaching 257 million investments were largely focused on our airport infrastructure mainly in argentina and italy key investments for the full year included the start of the construction of the new departure terminal and multilevel parking at ezeiza airport in argentina expected to begin operations this year and the start of the expansion of aeroparque airport we also undertook the expansion of regional airports including the jujuy san juan comodoro rivadavia and iguazu airports in brazil on the back of four new international flights announced by gol we ve made capital investments at our brasilia airport to expand the international boarding by its claim and duty free areas we also invested in the construction of runway safety areas let me take a moment to give you an update on our commercial project at brasilia airport we have redefined the project originally contemplated for this airport and are now planning a lower capital intensive model this new commercial space will be funded and operated by third parties with the airport receiving a percentage of the net operating income of the complex we have also been busy in italy we are particularly pleased with the conclusion of the environmental and urban impact studies and approvals with respect of our expansion plans at florence airport we are awaiting the final approval by the ministry of transport and expect to initiate works in the fourth quarter of 2019 we also started the expansion of the terminal building at pisa airport aiming to accommodate expected passenger growth an important event in the year was the agreement we entered into with investment corporation of dubai to jointly identify and develop new opportunities in the airport sector in italy eastern europe and the middle east finally in our other markets note that we have successfully extended by five years our concession agreement in ecuador which we executed last july additionally this month we extended for another 14 years the concession agreement in punta del este uruguay moving to slide number 4 traffic growth for the fourth quarter slowed to nearly 4 year on year mainly driven by argentina negatively impacted by difficult macro conditions and sharp fx volatility as already mentioned passenger traffic in argentina continued to decelerate up to 4 from almost 6 in the third quarter reflecting the overall slowdown in travel demand we also continued to see a mix shift in traffic with more affordable domestic travel up 12 year on year while international traffic declined over 8 in brazil traffic growth decelerated to nearly 3 year on year from over 5 in the third quarter italy posted a strong performance with traffic up 5 compared to 3 in the prior quarter the addition of new routes and airlines drove a pickup in international traffic more than offsetting the softer domestic travel demand in uruguay traffic contracted almost 3 year on year as performance remains affected by softer travel demand from argentina however we saw a seasonal improvement from the 5 drop experienced in the prior quarter traffic in armenia remains strong up close to 12 mainly due to the addition of new frequencies to destinations in russia ecuador continued to post a strong performance with traffic up over 7 reflecting the addition of new routes in the year while peru posted a slowdown in traffic growth following the suspension of operations of a low cost airline i will now hand up the call to raul francos who will review our operations and financial results please raul go ahead raul guillermo francos chief financial officer thank you martin good day everyone as gimena noted at the beginning of our presentation for a better understanding of our performance we will discuss our results excluding the impact of hyperinflation in argentina note however that in the fourth quarter 2018 the application of ias 29 resulted in a positive impact in reported numbers when compared to the previous accounting given that the indexation effect exceeded the translation impact from using the closing exchange rate as opposed to using the average exchange rate for the reporting period starting with the top line on slide 5 total revenue declined close to 13 year on year to nearly 363 million and 9 when also including construction revenues consolidated revenues were impacted by the mix shift from international to domestic traffic as well as lower travel demand in argentina revenues were also affected by the fx translation impact from the strong currency depreciation of both the argentine peso and the brazilian real aeronautical revenue declined 7 mainly due to weaker international traffic in argentina and currency depreciation in brazil by contrast we are very pleased with the results we are seeing in ecuador and armenia posting another quarter of revenue growth finally in italy traffic increase is not entirely reflected in the revenue line given that again this quarter marketing support expenses are deduced from revenues while in the year ago quarter they were included in sg a commercial revenue declined 12 4 year on year mainly reflecting lower demand in argentina and the fx translation impact in both argentina and brazil in local currency commercial revenues in brazil increased 15 benefiting from higher vip lounge and advertising revenues together with higher cargo volume in italy our initiative to enhance our service offering coupled with a higher traffic growth are showing positive result while armenia continued to perform well with growth mainly driven by higher fuel demand and prices coming to our cost structure on slide 6 this quarter we showed lower cost dilution particularly in argentina our largest market as inflation is catching up with the strong currency depreciation we experienced through the year the mix shift in revenues from international to domestic also contributed to lower cost dilution while cost of services ex ifric12 declined almost 5 year on year as a percentage of revenue we saw an increase of over 300 basis points this was mainly due to lower labor cost dilution arising from salary increases reflecting both growth in the employees base mainly in argentina inflation adjustments as well as higher maintenance cost sg a in turn was down slightly over 1 year on year but increased as a percentage of revenues impacted mainly by the increase in bad debt charges in brazil related to avianca brasil receivables partially offset by lower sale taxes in argentina sg a included one time items in both quarters ipo expenses in the fourth quarter 2017 and the write off of the commercial project in brazil due to its rest in the redefinition this quarter as martin just mentioned moving on to profitability on slide 7 adjusted ebitda ex ifric declined 18 6 to 87 million in the quarter growth in italy armenia and uruguay was more than offset by the weak performance in argentina and to a lesser extent in brazil in addition adjusted ebitda margin ex ifric contracted over 330 basis points to almost 28 1 from 31 4 in the same quarter of last year as we anticipated in our last earning call the strong margin expansion we saw in our previous quarter moderated as inflation is catching up with the currency depreciation in argentina reducing the benefit from the currency devaluation on cost in addition as i mentioned in the previous slide nonrecurring items in brazil also impacted the margin more details of these nonrecurring item is included in the earning release published this morning moving to the bottom line despite lower operating results our net income showed a significant increase due to a positive variance in non cash foreign exchange gains in argentina mainly arising from the us dollar denominated debt as the peso appreciated during the quarter this was partially offset by higher income tax expenses recorded in the quarter as shown on slide 8 we continue to maintain a healthy balance sheet that provides financial flexibility to continue developing our strategic initiatives total debt at the close of the quarter was relatively stable at 1 1 billion our net debt to last 12 months adjusted ebitda ratio slightly decreased to two times from 2 1 times in the prior quarter importantly we maintain a conservative maturity profile with around 10 of our debt maturing within the year and an adequate currency mix with about 60 of our debt denominated in us dollar 20 in reals and 14 in euros let me now turn the call back to martin who will go over performance at our key business segment and will comment on our outlook martin antranik eurnekian chief executive officer thank you raul starting with argentina on slide 9 revenues ex ifric declined 16 year on year despite the 4 increase in passenger traffic impacted by several factors we continue to experience overall slower travel demand along with a mix shift from international to lower priced domestic destinations this resulted in a 12 increase in domestic traffic and an 8 drop in international travel as the country is experiencing challenging macro environment we are

took place in the third quarter we are also seeing lower commercial revenues from international passengers particularly in duty free revenues were also negatively impacted by the mix shift in cargo volume with higher export activity and the sharp reduction in higher margin imports against this backdrop adjusted argentine segment ebitda declined nearly 27 and ex ifric12 margin contracted approximately 514 basis points to 35 7 differently from the third quarter and as anticipated in our prior earnings call the impact from higher inflation on cost of services more than offset the benefit from the currency depreciation on our peso based cost as inflation is catching with the peso depreciation we continued to advance our capex program in the country and invested 56 million in argentina funds were mainly allocated to the construction of new departures terminal building and multilevel parking at the ezeiza airport the repayment of the runway and new terminal building at comodoro rivadavia airport the construction of the new terminal buildings in iguazu and jujuy airport as well as several other investments across other airports in our concession as i mentioned earlier our capex program is targeted to absorb future passenger traffic growth we continue supporting the government s airplane revolution plan and plan to invest between 250 million to 300 million this year to be funded with cash flow from operations this is in line with the capex program we are developing closely with the government now please turn to slide 10 for the discussion about brazil total traffic in brazil increased nearly 3 year on year although a slowdown from the prior quarter along with the gradually improving macro environment growth was supported by the addition of new domestic and international routes opened by gol in the fourth quarter of 2018 partially compensating the fleet adjustment at the leading latin american airline and difficulties at the brazilian airline local currency revenues were up nearly 12 year on year driven by the growth in both aeronautical and commercial revenues we are very pleased with the good performance in commercial activities resulting from the new commercial agreements and higher cargo volumes on a reported basis however revenues declined almost 5 impacted by the fx translation effect from the depreciation of the brazilian real adjusted segment ebitda in turn was down 80 to 2 million with the margin contracting to almost 6 from 27 in the prior year quarter this was mainly due to nearly 4 million bad debt charge in connection with a brazilian carrier and 3 million write off resulting from our decision to no longer deploy capital to construct the new commercial area at brasilia airport and instead develop a lower risk model as i explained earlier this was partially offset by lower sg a we invested over 4 million during the quarter for the expansion of the international boarding areas together with the construction of runway safety areas and engineering project at brasilia airport now moving to italy on slide 11 traffic trends remained strong up 5 year on year driven by international traffic growth comparable revenues ex ifric and excluding marketing support expenses remained flat in the quarter we posted a good performance at our new retail and duty free stores at florence airport as well as higher car rental revenues from new areas opened in november adjusted segment ebitda was up an impressive 40 and adjusted segment ebitda margin ex ifric expanded by over 526 basis points to 16 6 in the quarter we invested over 7 million in the quarter mainly for the expansion of the terminal at pisa airport and master plan development at florence airport now that we have concluded the environmental and urban impact studies we expect to obtain final approval in the next few months and to start construction of the florence airport expansion in the fourth quarter of 2019

earnings season to ramp up in earnest tomorrow with big banks reporting quarterly results ahead of that it appears that market participants don t want to commit too much either way in economic news initial claims for unemployment benefits came in lower than expected at 196 000 versus the 215 000 forecast in a briefing com consensus that marked the lowest level for initial claims since october 1969 the labor department said when people are employed that can bode well for consumer spending which supports a huge chunk of the economy we ll also have to see whether strong employment trickles down to help the housing market mining the minutes yesterday each of the main three u s indices ended in the green after the minutes of the fed s last meeting showed pretty much what the market was expecting and reiterated the central bank s dovish stance the dovish pivot has helped the market move higher this year by allaying fears that monetary policy makers would be too aggressive in cutting rates even as inflation is muted now with softer economic data coming in and the fed having lowered its gross domestic product forecast for the united states the central bank has stood pat on interest rates and signaled that will continue a majority of participants expected that the evolution of the economic outlook and risks to the outlook would likely warrant leaving the target range unchanged for the remainder of the year the minutes said wednesday still the fed appears to be willing to rely on whatever data comes in with some central bankers striking a decidedly neutral tone saying they could go either way on interest rates again from the minutes several participants noted that their views of the appropriate target range for the federal funds rate could shift in either direction based on incoming data growth worries are global the dampened outlook on the economy echoed what s coming in from across the pond the european central bank held interest rates steady wednesday with its president citing slower growth momentum amid risks that are tilted to the downside but it appeared that the market paid more attention to the fed s more neutral stance than the ecb s more pessimistic view the ecb s statement comes after the international monetary fund cut its outlook for 2019 global growth on tuesday due in part to trade issues the fund now sees the global economy growing by 3 3 this year compared to its previous forecast of 3 5 a big reason for the dour economic prognosis continues to be the ongoing trade war between the united states and china which has affected hundreds of billions of dollars of goods from the world s largest economies on wednesday news on that front appeared to be promising but it was still generally in line with what the market has been expecting for some time and it lacked the punch of a really big breakthrough eye on the banks in corporate news bank executives were in washington to testify before congress but there didn t seem to be too many surprises there to move the market jpmorgan chase and wells fargo kick earnings season into higher gear friday citigroup bank of america morgan stanley and goldman sachs are all expected to report earnings next week the financials sector has been flagging in the face of a dovish fed and a slowing economy data source cme group chart source the thinkorswim platform from td ameritrade inflation muted it seems that inflation numbers continue to play into the fed s hand although the headline consumer price index cpi increased 0 4 month over month in march a larger than expected jump and the highest increase since january 2018 inflation was much more tame when you take out volatile food and energy prices the so called core cpi which does just that rose only 0 1 which was less than the 0 2 gain a briefing com consensus had expected the key takeaway from the report is that the core rate of inflation moderated on a year over year basis to 2 0 from 2 1 in february which is a trend that should keep the federal reserve comfortable with its position of being on hold briefing com said resuming treasury buying while there generally wasn t too much unexpected in the fed minutes wednesday there was one point that seemed to stand out as a bit of a surprise it turns out that some central bankers want to resume purchases of treasury securities after the fed s balance sheet reduction program ends in september while the market has cheered the dovish pivot by the fed it s conceivable that the market might not welcome such a move which would essentially be another way for the fed to keep pressure on interest rates without an outright cut such a move might not be well received because the market probably thinks the fed needs to keep some dovish tools undeployed in case something unexpected goes wrong with the economy after all low growth combined with low interest rates can be challenging just ask japan fun and games one way market participants seem to have

the us dollar is being traded without a clear dynamic after the release of the fomc minutes the fomc minutes for march showed that the fed would not adjust policy and planned to keep the key marks of monetary policy until the end of this year however some officials said they could change their views on the key interest rate although politicians noted that the us labor market looked strong some of them said that the deterioration in the us economy could be intensified due to the large debt of american companies they also noted a continuing weakness in the housing market yesterday the dollar index dx closed with a small minus 0 05 meanwhile the us currency was supported by the news that the us and china were striving for progress in the negotiations on a possible trade agreement between the countries in particular the treasury secretary steven mnuchin said that the parties agreed on a mechanism that would ensure the implementation and compliance of the trade agreement the us claim china to implement significant reforms to end the theft of us intellectual property washington also wants beijing to limit industrial subsidies expand its markets for us companies and significantly increase purchases of us agricultural energy and industrial products financial market participants assess the results of the ecb meeting so the central bank left the key interest rates unchanged as experts expected the regulator announced it intended to keep interest rates at current levels until the end of 2019 the head of the central bank mario draghi is concerned about the growing risks in the eurozone economy the ecb will continue to reinvest the proceeds from the bonds purchased as part of the quantitative easing program to the fullest extent during the additional period after it starts raising interest rates the european council agreed yesterday for a further extension of the brexit deadline the european union extended the exit deadline until october 31 2019 german chancellor angela merkel insisted that the uk should not be expelled and leave the block without an agreement the british pound was supported additionally by positive economic releases from the uk the black gold prices have become stable oil quotes are consolidating near annual highs at the moment futures for the wti crude oil are testing the mark of 64 00 per barrel market indicators yesterday the bullish sentiment was observed in the us stock market spy 0 34 dia 0 03 qqq 0 54 the 10 year us government bonds yield fell slightly currently the figure is at the level of 2 48 2 49 the news feed for 2019 04 11
suddenly it seems that emerging market economies have gained a respite capital flows to these economies dried up in the second half of last year as the us federal reserve raised its policy rate for five consecutive quarters and shrank its balance sheet but in january the fed announced a pause which now looks to be extended the dot plots of federal open market committee members currently indicate no rate rises for the remainder of the year moreover the fed has signalled that quantitative tightening the process of allowing treasuries and mortgage backed securities to roll off its balance sheet will continue only through september this means merciful relief for emerging economies which have been buoyed by the resumption of capital inflows a replay of the second half of last year much less of the 2013 taper tantrum now seems unlikely in addition there is the rebound of the chinese economy other emerging markets linked to china through global supply chains and raw material exports are highly leveraged on its growth thus they had good reason to worry when chinese manufacturing activity shrank in february for the third straight month chinese exports are down car sales are down as recently as two weeks ago all was doom and gloom we now know that this pessimism was overdone manufacturing activity recovered in march reflecting measures taken by the chinese authorities policymakers are relying more on fiscal stimulus and less on liquidity creation to offset weak demand my view contrary to that of others is that this is something china can well afford government debt is still low by emerging market standards more important the differential between the interest rate and the growth rate which shapes debt dynamics is lower than virtually anywhere else in the world consequently the central government was able to raise the threshold below which no income tax is paid and to add a tax deduction for parental elder care it had room to cut taxes for small businesses it can cut vat and spend upward of 1 5 of gdp on railways roads and other projects as announced in march to be sure china s corporate debt load is heavy total social financing is still expected to grow by 10 this year faster than nominal gdp much of this new liquidity is destined for relatively inefficient state owned enterprises already saddled with bad loans that said china remains enough of a controlled economy that the authorities can mitigate its deceleration as last month s manufacturing rebound indicates relief may also be coming on the tariff front us president donald trump may have hardened his anti china rhetoric at the behest of his trade representative robert lighthizer who sees threats as necessary to extract concessions from the chinese government on intellectual property and technology transfer there is also the danger of additional us tariffs on other products and sources such as motor vehicles manufactured in europe and mexico but trump s tariff talk is consistently worse than his bite when other countries refuse to roll over and accept his demands he has a history of accepting limited concessions and declaring victory as with the renegotiation of the north american free trade agreement there is every sign now that a similar cosmetic agreement is in the offing with china at the same time trump never entirely abandons the tariff threat trade conflicts are useful background noise that diverts attention from ongoing political investigations and embarrassments they make it appear to the uninitiated and uninformed that the administration is doing something about slowing us growth as a result trump s tariff threats will continue to roil global markets and international relations but they will not culminate in a full blown tariff war and complete collapse of the multilateral system but there remains one significant and serious risk to emerging markets a us recession the inversion of the yield curve late last month suggests that investors are now taking this possibility seriously some sages at institutions like jp morgan which make their living forecasting such events think that there is a significant chance of a recession this year or next if a recession does occur it will be severe because there will be relatively little us policymakers can and will do about it us interest rates remain low giving the fed little room to cut and because the budget deficit has already blown up there will be less appetite for fiscal stimulus moreover a us recession would interact with other risks trump would look for someone to blame so the trade war could be back on in that case china would find it harder to outgrow its corporate debt problem which in turn would weaken the world s principal engine of economic expansion for this reason the recent respite for emerging market economies could be short lived given the uncertainties about us policy and chinese growth prospects it is too early to conclude that these countries are out of the woods

reconcilings with the sec we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements to reflect new or changed events or circumstances i also would like to remind you that following the categorization of argentina as a highly inflationary economy in accordance with ifrs commencing july 2018 we began applying ifrs rule ias 29 this rule applies directly starting january 1st of 2018 for comparison purposes in addition to presenting as reported results we are also disclosing the isolated impact of the adoption of hyperinflation accounting in argentina and our results excluding rule ias 29 additional information in connection with the application of rule ias 29 can be found in our earnings report note that for comparison purposes and a better understanding of the underlying performance in our presentation today we will be discussing results excluding hyperinflation accounting in argentina now let me turn the call over to our ceo martin eurnekian advertisement advertisement martin antranik eurnekian chief executive officer thank you gimena hello everyone and thank you for joining us today it s a pleasure to welcome you to corporacion america airports fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call i will begin my presentation with a discussion of the highlights of the quarter and then raul will take you through our financial results afterwards i will provide an update on our key business segments and overview for the remainder of the year we will then open the call to your questions starting with slide 3 2018 was a challenging year with travel dynamics and results impacted by the unfavorable macro environment and a sharp devaluation in argentina our largest market and to a lesser extent in brazil beyond these headwinds we served over 81 million passengers across our airport network up 6 year on year as we continued to add new routes and airlines and began operations at el palomar our new airport targeting low cost airlines in argentina excluding inflation accounting adjusted ebitda margin ex ifric for the year expanded 190 basis points to almost 37 and adjusted ebitda increased by low single digits looking at the fourth quarter specifically adjusted ebitda ex ias 29 declined almost 19 and margin ex ifric contracted approximately 330 basis points year on year impacted by the difficult economic conditions in argentina as inflation in the country is catching up with currency depreciation reducing the strong operating leverage experienced in the third quarter this more than offset the strong performance in other markets for example brazil delivered a nearly 61 increase in comparable adjusted ebitda excluding one time items while italy reported 40 growth in adjusted ebitda these good results were further supported by the majority of our other countries of operations advertisement advertisement with the goal of positioning the company for expected future growth and further enhance the passenger experience we continued to advance our capex program during the year during the fourth quarter we made capital investments of nearly 70 million with full year standing reaching 257 million investments were largely focused on our airport infrastructure mainly in argentina and italy key investments for the full year included the start of the construction of the new departure terminal and multilevel parking at ezeiza airport in argentina expected to begin operations this year and the start of the expansion of aeroparque airport we also undertook the expansion of regional airports including the jujuy san juan comodoro rivadavia and iguazu airports in brazil on the back of four new international flights announced by gol we ve made capital investments at our brasilia airport to expand the international boarding by its claim and duty free areas we also invested in the construction of runway safety areas let me take a moment to give you an update on our commercial project at brasilia airport we have redefined the project originally contemplated for this airport and are now planning a lower capital intensive model this new commercial space will be funded and operated by third parties with the airport receiving a percentage of the net operating income of the complex we have also been busy in italy we are particularly pleased with the conclusion of the environmental and urban impact studies and approvals with respect of our expansion plans at florence airport we are awaiting the final approval by the ministry of transport and expect to initiate works in the fourth quarter of 2019 we also started the expansion of the terminal building at pisa airport aiming to accommodate expected passenger growth an important event in the year was the agreement we entered into with investment corporation of dubai to jointly identify and develop new opportunities in the airport sector in italy eastern europe and the middle east advertisement advertisement finally in our other markets note that we have successfully extended by five years our concession agreement in ecuador which we executed last july additionally this month we extended for another 14 years the concession agreement in punta del este uruguay moving to slide number 4 traffic growth for the fourth quarter slowed to nearly 4 year on year mainly driven by argentina negatively impacted by difficult macro conditions and sharp fx volatility as already mentioned passenger traffic in argentina continued to decelerate up to 4 from almost 6 in the third quarter reflecting the overall slowdown in travel demand we also continued to see a mix shift in traffic with more affordable domestic travel up 12 year on year while international traffic declined over 8 in brazil traffic growth decelerated to nearly 3 year on year from over 5 in the third quarter italy posted a strong performance with traffic up 5 compared to 3 in the prior quarter the addition of new routes and airlines drove a pickup in international traffic more than offsetting the softer domestic travel demand in uruguay traffic contracted almost 3 year on year as performance remains affected by softer travel demand from argentina however we saw a seasonal improvement from the 5 drop experienced in the prior quarter traffic in armenia remains strong up close to 12 mainly due to the addition of new frequencies to destinations in russia ecuador continued to post a strong performance with traffic up over 7 reflecting the addition of new routes in the year while peru posted a slowdown in traffic growth following the suspension of operations of a low cost airline advertisement advertisement i will now hand up the call to raul francos who will review our operations and financial results please raul go ahead raul guillermo francos chief financial officer thank you martin good day everyone as gimena noted at the beginning of our presentation for a better understanding of our performance we will discuss our results excluding the impact of hyperinflation in argentina note however that in the fourth quarter 2018 the application of ias 29 resulted in a positive impact in reported numbers when compared to the previous accounting given that the indexation effect exceeded the translation impact from using the closing exchange rate as opposed to using the average exchange rate for the reporting period starting with the top line on slide 5 total revenue declined close to 13 year on year to nearly 363 million and 9 when also including construction revenues consolidated revenues were impacted by the mix shift from international to domestic traffic as well as lower travel demand in argentina revenues were also affected by the fx translation impact from the strong currency depreciation of both the argentine peso and the brazilian real aeronautical revenue declined 7 mainly due to weaker international traffic in argentina and currency depreciation in brazil by contrast we are very pleased with the results we are seeing in ecuador and armenia posting another quarter of revenue growth advertisement advertisement finally in italy traffic increase is not entirely reflected in the revenue line given that again this quarter marketing support expenses are deduced from revenues while in the year ago quarter they were included in sg a commercial revenue declined 12 4 year on year mainly reflecting lower demand in argentina and the fx translation impact in both argentina and brazil in local currency commercial revenues in brazil increased 15 benefiting from higher vip lounge and advertising revenues together with higher cargo volume in italy our initiative to enhance our service offering coupled with a higher traffic growth are showing positive result while armenia continued to perform well with growth mainly driven by higher fuel demand and prices coming to our cost structure on slide 6 this quarter we showed lower cost dilution particularly in argentina our largest market as inflation is catching up with the strong currency depreciation we experienced through the year the mix shift in revenues from international to domestic also contributed to lower cost dilution while cost of services ex ifric12 declined almost 5 year on year as a percentage of revenue we saw an increase of over 300 basis points this was mainly due to lower labor cost dilution arising from salary increases reflecting both growth in the employees base mainly in argentina inflation adjustments as well as higher maintenance cost sg a in turn was down slightly over 1 year on year but increased as a percentage of revenues impacted mainly by the increase in bad debt charges in brazil related to avianca brasil receivables partially offset by lower sale taxes in argentina sg a included one time items in both quarters ipo expenses in the fourth quarter 2017 and the write off of the commercial project in brazil due to its rest in the redefinition this quarter as martin just mentioned moving on to profitability on slide 7 adjusted ebitda ex ifric declined 18 6 to 87 million in the quarter growth in italy armenia and uruguay was more than offset by the weak performance in argentina and to a lesser extent in brazil in addition adjusted ebitda margin ex ifric contracted over 330 basis points to almost 28 1 from 31 4 in the same quarter of last year as we anticipated in our last earning call the strong margin expansion we saw in our previous quarter moderated as inflation is catching up with the currency depreciation in argentina reducing the benefit from the currency devaluation on cost in addition as i mentioned in the previous slide nonrecurring items in brazil also impacted the margin more details of these nonrecurring item is included in the earning release published this morning advertisement advertisement moving to the bottom line despite lower operating results our net income showed a significant increase due to a positive variance in non cash foreign exchange gains in argentina mainly arising from the us dollar denominated debt as the peso appreciated during the quarter this was partially offset by higher income tax expenses recorded in the quarter as shown on slide 8 we continue to maintain a healthy balance sheet that provides financial flexibility to continue developing our strategic initiatives total debt at the close of the quarter was relatively stable at 1 1 billion our net debt to last 12 months adjusted ebitda ratio slightly decreased to two times from 2 1 times in the prior quarter importantly we maintain a conservative maturity profile with around 10 of our debt maturing within the year and an adequate currency mix with about 60 of our debt denominated in us dollar 20 in reals and 14 in euros let me now turn the call back to martin who will go over performance at our key business segment and will comment on our outlook martin antranik eurnekian chief executive officer advertisement advertisement thank you raul starting with argentina on slide 9 revenues ex ifric declined 16 year on year despite the 4 increase in passenger traffic impacted by several factors we continue to experience overall slower travel demand along with a mix shift from international to lower priced domestic destinations this resulted in a 12 increase in domestic traffic and an 8 drop in international travel as the country is experiencing challenging macro environment we are seeing a sustained increase in activities from low cost airlines for example during the fourth quarter norwegian air argentina started local operations with five domestic routes while chilean local carrier jetsmart launched international operations from el palomar designated an international airport last october and fly bondi added routes to paraguay and punta del este at the same time aeronautical revenues from domestic passengers and the portion of our commercial revenues that are peso denominated remain affected by the fx translation impact from the sharp peso depreciation that took place in the third quarter we are also seeing lower commercial revenues from international passengers particularly in duty free revenues were also negatively impacted by the mix shift in cargo volume with higher export activity and the sharp reduction in higher margin imports against this backdrop adjusted argentine segment ebitda declined nearly 27 and ex ifric12 margin contracted approximately 514 basis points to 35 7 differently from the third quarter and as anticipated in our prior earnings call the impact from higher inflation on cost of services more than offset the benefit from the currency depreciation on our peso based cost as inflation is catching with the peso depreciation we continued to advance our capex program in the country and invested 56 million in argentina funds were mainly allocated to the construction of new departures terminal building and multilevel parking at the ezeiza airport the repayment of the runway and new terminal building at comodoro rivadavia airport the construction of the new terminal buildings in iguazu and jujuy airport as well as several other investments across other airports in our concession as i mentioned earlier our capex program is targeted to absorb future passenger traffic growth we continue supporting the government s airplane revolution plan and plan to invest between 250 million to 300 million this year to be funded with cash flow from operations this is in line with the capex program we are developing closely with the government now please turn to slide 10 for the discussion about brazil total traffic in brazil increased nearly 3 year on year although a slowdown from the prior quarter along with the gradually improving macro environment growth was supported by the addition of new domestic and international routes opened by gol in the fourth quarter of 2018 partially compensating the fleet adjustment at the leading latin american airline and difficulties at the brazilian airline local currency revenues were up nearly 12 year on year driven by the growth in both aeronautical and commercial revenues we are very pleased with the good performance in commercial activities resulting from the new commercial agreements and higher cargo volumes on a reported basis however revenues declined almost 5 impacted by the fx translation effect from the depreciation of the brazilian real adjusted segment ebitda in turn was down 80 to 2 million with the margin contracting to almost 6 from 27 in the prior year quarter this was mainly due to nearly 4 million bad debt charge in connection with a brazilian carrier and 3 million write off resulting from our decision to no longer deploy capital to construct the new commercial area at brasilia airport and instead develop a lower risk model as i explained earlier this was partially offset by lower sg a we invested over 4 million during the quarter for the expansion of the international boarding areas together with the construction of runway safety areas and engineering project at brasilia airport now moving to italy on slide 11 traffic trends remained strong up 5 year on year driven by international traffic growth comparable revenues ex ifric and excluding marketing support expenses remained flat in the quarter we posted a good performance at our new retail and duty free stores at florence airport as well as higher car rental revenues from new areas opened in november adjusted segment ebitda was up an impressive 40 and adjusted segment ebitda margin ex ifric expanded by over 526 basis points to 16 6 in the quarter we invested over 7 million in the quarter mainly for the expansion of the terminal at pisa airport and master plan development at florence airport now that we have concluded the environmental and urban impact studies we expect to obtain final approval in the next few months and to start construction of the florence airport expansion in the fourth quarter of 2019 now please turn to slide 12 to wrap up our presentation while 2018 was a challenging year marked by significant macro and fx volatility in argentina and to a lesser extent in brazil which impacted our results we continued to make progress on our strategic initiatives further strengthening our airport platform for when the macro environment improves looking to the current year we expect travel trends in argentina to remain impacted by the difficult economic dynamics in the country in addition to the added uncertainty of this being a presidential election year while we expect the macro backdrop to improve gradually in the second half of the year given the lag between the purchase decision and the actual travel date and overall pickup in international traffic trends in argentina is anticipated to flow into our results in early 2020 domestic travel is expected to continue to improve throughout the year as connectivity continues to increase in the country we also expect to see an ongoing gradual pickup in inbound international traffic as traveling to argentina becomes more affordable on the back of the weak peso but not fully offsetting the follow up in outgoing traffic by locals taking these factors into account we expect to see a single digit increase in total passenger traffic growth in argentina for the year by contrast in brazil we expect to see the economy continue its improving trend with traffic growth continuing throughout the year this is mainly the case for international passenger traffic which is benefiting from the recent opening of international routes we see a similar positive trend in italy complemented by solid traffic trends in our other markets we remain fully committed to elevating the travel experience across our airports developing new routes and frequencies while continuing to establish infrastructure mainly in argentina and italy and further strengthening our global platform for our long term success this is the end of our prepared remarks we are now ready to take questions operator please open the line for questions questions and answers operator we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions and our first question today comes from roberto otero with bank of america please go ahead peter bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi gentlemen actually this is peter ph here thanks for taking my question i have one quick question from our side and i ll move folks on aa2000 could you give us any update on the ongoing negotiation with the government regrading the concession 10 years extension and i mean in your view how should the upcoming election part impact the renegotiation right and if you could give us a sense of timing should we expect any final terms happening still in 2019 or maybe it ll be more conservative to assume this is happening all in 2020 onwards that s my question thanks martin antranik eurnekian chief executive officer hello this is martin and again thank you for your question it would be difficult for me to give you an idea on when the government will be ready we are engaging with them as often as possible to understand when can we officially launch a negotiation to be honest the fact that we have entered the election mode in argentina has at least in our perception shifted the administration s priorities in terms of what they need to achieve because as you probably understand everybody goes into election mode once we start getting closer to the primaries and presidential elections so this is the feel that i can give you although not impossible to do a negotiation this year i think that the fact that everybody is focusing on elections puts a little bit of strain in that possibility of being able to really close before the end of the year peter bank of america merrill lynch analyst all right martin thanks for respond my question operator and our next question comes from ian zaffino with oppenheimer please go ahead with your question mark zhang oppenheimer co analyst good morning guys this is mark on for ian thanks for taking our question so if you guys could provide a little bit more detail on the sort of the time line of the capital spend particularly at aa2000 be much appreciated so just a couple give us i guess like potentially give us a sense of when ezeiza will open in 2019 or just like first half or second half events and what s sort of the time line on the aeroparque expansion that ll be much appreciated thank you martin antranik eurnekian chief executive officer okay we have a set of inauguration set mark for this year ezeiza being the main one the set as of today the set date for inauguration of the new terminal in ezeiza is the end of september but that will be fine tuned with the group that is doing the actual capex and the government as well for the rest we have a calendar for opening of the works that we have been doing so far and we can definitely provide that to you but it will be publicly announced each time we decide on exact date for the openings that we have this year mark zhang oppenheimer co analyst okay terrific that s very helpful okay great okay great thank you guys very much operator operator instructions and our next question comes from bruno amorim with goldman sachs please go ahead bruno amorim goldman sachs analyst yes hi good morning i have two questions so the first one is out of the additional 1 billion in capex expected to be included in the concession agreement in argentina how much have you already done so far and also has the regulator recognized or authorized this investment or is it something to be discussed only when the additional 1 billion is approved by the regulator and the second question is when should we expect to see the next tariff revision in argentina is this negotiation tied with the discussion around concession renewal and additional investments for 1 billion or are those separate discussions could we see tariffs being adjusted before the final decision on the extension so those are my two questions please martin antranik eurnekian chief executive officer thank you first the two things are totally separate according to our current contract the tariff revision should be done yearly the regulator is a little bit late as far as we know and for the interaction we have they are getting ready to finish the exercise to be able to publish it it s not a negotiation they have to run the numbers and do the adjustments so it s not linked to any negotiation or anything else whatsoever regarding the capex question as the discussion we are having end of 2018 we were either at the number agreed in the concession contract in terms of total capex for the concession or a little bit or slightly beyond that number so for 2018 that is a fact for 2019 is where we are going beyond that number but everything we do is approved by the regulator and taken into account into the regulatory incumbency in the concession contract bruno amorim goldman sachs analyst very clear thank you very much operator and this will conclude our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to martin eurnekian for any closing remarks martin antranik eurnekian chief executive officer well thank you very much for joining us today we really appreciate your interest in our company we look

commentary by dawit woldegiorgis visiting scholar at boston university african studies center april 10 2019 absolutely oversold as instability and violence spreads across much of ethiopia with most recent incidents getting close to the capital in northern showa it is becoming a matter of grave concern to ethiopians and regional governments whether there will be a full fledged civil war in ethiopia all eyes are on prime minister abiy ahmed who came to power on an agenda of peaceful change during his one year premiership the country s situation has gone down from bad to worse with a serious possibility of a civil war when herbert hoover the 31st president of the usa began his term in 1928 he was extremely popular however soon after the great depression dominated his presidency he is now mostly remembered for his failure to respond to the crisis he purportedly said my friends have made the american people think of me as sort of superman able to cope successfully with the most difficult and complicated problems they expect the impossible from me and should there arise in the land conditions with which the political machinery is unable to cope i will be the one to suffer i have been absolutely oversold the single most significant criticism levied against herbert hoover is that he did not do enough to combat the great depression many historians believe hoover underestimated the severity of the great depression hoover believed it would get better but instead it just kept getting worse toward the end of his term he served between 1929 1933 hoover tried to address the core economic issues but it was too little too late despite hoover s last minute attempt many americans believe that he was the man who stood by idly when the country was falling apart he served only one term ably was oversold and considered as a superman abiy emerged at a time when people were under siege very insecure and civil war seemed eminent abiy s words and some of his actions were soothing and gave hope to people like hoover abiy underestimated the severity and complexity of the problems of ethiopia but unlike hoover instead of humility abiy embraced the idea that he was being seen as the great redeemer of this troubled nation emperor haile selassie mengistu and meles all believed that they were super human beings they refused to listen to the warning signs all faced an ignominious end and left a legacy that has today put the country on the brinks yesterday s rulers had the integrity of the country as a primary agenda in this they did not fail their people this generation took the mantle of leadership to rectify the mistakes of the past and build on the positive factors that have kept this country united this generation has failed in delivering this and put the very existence of the country at peril ethiopia has now become a rudderless ship floating on troubled water ethiopia is a failed state ethiopia is a failed state by all indicators the concern now is how intense and how tragic it is going to be the warning signs were there for a few years ethnic politics has been bleeding the country and now there are fears that the country might collapse the leaders and the elites knew that the ethnic politics that has been institutionalized by the ruling party the ethiopian people s revolutionary democratic front eprdf for the last 28 years was the single cause of discontent and dis enfranchisement that brought the country now to its knees neither meles zenawi nor his successor wanted to address this issue when prime minister abiy ahmed came to power people felt that he was going to be the redeemer of this troubled country that was exactly one year ago the euphoria has now evaporated and ethiopia is fast becoming a failed state in its truest sense a failed state includes lack of control over armed forces militias etc within the country lack of free participation in politics lack of control over territory within national borders massive displacements failure to provide public services food health shelter etc high level of corruption high numbers of refugees seeking to leave no or poorly functioning economy ethiopia has all the above states fail because they can no longer provide services the most critical is human security if they cannot provide security and protection to the people the governments lose legitimacy in the eyes of the public and people take necessary steps individually or in groups including taking the law into their hands other internal and external groups take advantage of the situation and the violence gets worse the competition for the control of resources creates war lords with a plethora of hate directed either at the government or at each other addis standard of march 26 states the ethiopian government and its regional states authorities are increasingly facing challenges to enforce order and security control over the territory of the federation several areas are allegedly not administratively connected to the center but run by local groupings who have either kicked out or breached with the party network of the ruling eprdf coalition the conflict and violence has spread across oromia region northern showa wollo and southern ethiopia and in many other parts of the country the safest place now ironically is tigray criminal gangs mostly associated with olf querro oromo youth movement and groups that are not clearly identified roam the country freely committing atrocious crimes people have become used to killings roadblocks robbery displacements destruction of homes and houses they have become so routine that people just pray that the worst would not come but the worst is closing in a new founded human rights organization in the capital addis abeba has issued a report on human rights abuses under pm abiy s government in addis abeba the capital it states on its web site this document is intended to serve as a chronological catalogue of human rights abuses and gross negligence of duty on the part of the ethiopian government under prime minister abiy ahmed the outline of the report is the irregular appointment of a mayor in addis abeba and its fall out the burayu massacre and its fall outs the imprisonment of individuals seeking to establish a civic advocacy group in addis abeba the addis abeba resident identity card scandal the legetafo displacement of people by government the addis abeba question demographic engineering these incidents taking place in the heart of the country took the already chaotic nation to another level the silence of the prime minister in most of these incidents was baffling as well it created the perception that the country was leaderless a leader of a country in crisis makes hard decisions that are in the best interest of the country a leader does not allow things to happen on their own a leader even in the present loose federal system of ethiopia must have a degree of control pm abiy is clearly not in control the central government of ethiopia today is at its weakest the africa institute for strategic and security studies aisss warned ethiopian land regional leaders numerous times of the dangers that ethiopia was facing and the direct impact it would have on regional stability aisss sees ethiopia s current situation as a threat to stability in the horn of africa and beyond a civil war in ethiopia will create unprecedented tragedy and turmoil that will reverberate across the continent and beyond allowing armed combatants to enter the country without a clear agreement between the government and the armed combatants was one huge mistake i attended a meeting where the ceo of the reintegration project office demobilization and reintegration of ex combatants in the office of the prime minster who informed us that there were no written agreements between the government and the parties to the conflict this is one of the gross mistakes that led to the current crisis the militants who were supposed to be demobilized and reintegrated into the society have been allowed to enter the country but have not yet laid down their arms and have not gone through a process that would allow them to reintegrate in the society and live a normal life one of the senior opposition leaders neamin zeleke seriously complained about the government s unwillingness or incapacity to treat the combatants humanly and in such a way that they don t become threats to the security of the country now some have become real threats there are several experiences on the subject of demobilization in africa the government chose not to seek advice or support not willing or being unable to have a clear road map was another most serious issue that was not in the list of the priorities of the pm a road map is a necessary step to begin a transition with so many of the fundamental issues unaddressed and the leadership unwilling to take bold measures it was not much of surprise that the country was heading towards uncharted territory the government was not prepared to listen and act when the early warning were there for everybody to to see with reports from many corners of ethiopia and the region today ethiopia is definitely in the category of the few failed states in africa the expert on failed states robert rotberg writes on princeton university press the failure and collapse of nation states failed states are tense deeply conflicted dangerous and contested bitterly by warring factions in most failed states government troops battle armed revolts led by one or more rivals occasionally the official authorities in a failed state face two or more insurgencies varieties of civil unrest different degrees of communal discontent and a plethora of dissent directed at the state and at groups within the state the central government has lost control of most of the regions and has not been able to perform the basic functions of a government people have fallen victim to competing factions and criminal gangs it is prudent as well to suspect that there could be foreign hands in all these civil war is looming over ethiopia in the most militarized zone in the world that can possibly change into a proxy war with many foreign stake holders trying to influence situation towards their own interest the fragile states index fsi earlier known as the failed sates index is an annual ranking of 178 countries based on the different pressures they face that impact their levels of fragility the index is based on the fund for peace s proprietary conflict assessment system tool cast analytical approach based on comprehensive social science methodology three primary streams of data quantitative qualitative and expert validation are triangulated and subjected to critical review to obtain final scores for the fsi the fragile states index shows consistently since 2007 that ethiopia is one of the least dysfunctional states in the world the failed states index prepared by the reputable fund for peace institute shows 2007 17th 2008 16th 2009 16th 2010 15th 2011 20th 2012 17th and 2013 19th 2104 19th 2015 19th 2017 15 2018 15 the 2019 report is expected to be worse for now the countries ahead of it are countries like syria yemen somalia south sudan afghanistan drc and car all are in severe or state of low intensity war if situation is allowed to continue ethiopia will be ahead of all above the second most populated nation in africa with over 100 million people poverty ridden insecure unstable and dysfunctional with strategic location and resources will certainly ignite regional conflict and proxy wars western countries had falsely anointed ethiopia as a stable country with the fastest growing economy in the continent the facts are clearer now than ever ethiopia is a failed state nearing complete collapse ethiopia has the highest number of internally displaced people in 2018 with 3 million with more displaced people in 2019 the figure is nearing 4 million uprooted from their homes as a result of the conflicts 1 4 million ethiopians fled their homes in 2018 while 1 2 million syrians left the guardian has this to say on most recent internal displacements one settlement in the village of gotiti hosts 20 30 000 ethnic gedeos who have been denied humanitarian assistance above all food aid since last august more than a million ethiopians were forced from their homes by ethnic violence in 2018 the highest number of internally displaced persons idps of any country last year the worst of it took place in the south where an estimated 800 000 mostly ethnic gedeos fled the district of west guji in oromia the country s largest region this is a higher number and over a shorter period of time than occurred at the height of myanmar s rohingya crisis in 2017 the conflict looked on the surface like a malthusian eruption in which population outstrips food supply gedeos and guji oromos share some of the country s most densely populated farmland and both groups are fast growing in number but gruesome reports of lynchings rapes and beheadings and of complicity among local officials police and militia makes it seem more like organized ethnic cleansing than an ordinary tribal clash the constitution established by the eprdf allows some ethnic groups to have their own regions amhara oromia tigray somali gambella afar ethiopia s more than 80 ethnic groups are demanding to have their own regional governments in all of these regions people who are not considered not to belong originally from that particular area are being forcibly displaced meskerem abera explains in gruesome details of the slaughtering and torturing of many recently in southern ethiopia hundreds of years of tolerance and peaceful co existence amongst the colorful diversity of ethiopians is crumbling right in front of pm abiy who had come to power with a slogan of love and togetherness these slogans are ringing hollow in the face of these brutalities there are chilling messages of death and destruction coming from many corners with pervasive disorder that threatens the survival of ethiopia as we know it today below average october to december belg rains in southern ethiopia has reduced the availability of water and pasture and slowed the recovery of some herders according to the famine early warning systems network fews net as a result vulnerable populations in pastoral areas are expected to experience crisis ipc 3 levels of acute food insecurity through may fews net reports the february usaid food security report gives a very gloomy picture for the coming months in ethiopia insecurity throughout ethiopia continues to prompt population displacement generate humanitarian needs and hinder relief organizations from delivering life saving assistance more than 80 percent of the 2 9 million internally displaced persons idps identified throughout the country have cited conflict as the primary driver of displacement humanitarian agencies are providing assistance to vulnerable populations as security conditions and other access constraints such as poor infrastructure permit below average october to december belg rains in southern ethiopia has reduced the availability of water and pasture and slowed the recovery of some herders according to the famine early warning systems network fews net this is what is called complex emergency the combination of natural drought and manmade disaster conflict and forced displacement this situation will further exasperate the already fragile security situation as millions more are displaced and the competition for scarce resources intensifies ethiopia is the second largest borrower from china next to angola with 13 7 billion dollars in debt according to the 2018 report moreover there are rumors that ethiopia has defaulted payments of this loan the intensifying repayment risks from the ethiopian government s debt reaching 59 percent of gdp is worrying investors china s mission to the african union in addis ababa said on its website in july it said that chinese investment in the country was cooling and that the china export and credit insurance corp was reducing the scale of its investment there governor yinager dessie on his deliberation on the performance of the central bank to the parliament finance standing committee on 27 march 2019 has confirmed ethiopia s export earning is 1 64 billion while the import is 10 5 billion usd which shows a deficit around 5000 percent even with huge import export deficit the country is suffering from shortage of basic essentials like medicine and raw material according to the amharic weekly the reporter of march 31 the governor of the central bank stated that the foreign exchange reserve is entirely low and at this moment the country can only afford to import medicine and fuel only and that very cautiously he stated that the foreign exchange that the country has now comes from remittances ethiopian airlines and foreign loans and grants unless the country gets more loans the country will have no capacity to do anything else he stated in other words the governor told the parliament the country is bankrupt with the wide spread insecurity and restrictions of movement and increasing loss of confidence over the state of the nation investors are becoming reluctant to put their money in ethiopia the governor also stated that the 100 year old development bank of ethiopia is also near to bankruptcy he stated of the 46 17 billon ethiopian birr it has loaned 39 45 is irrecoverable showing the extent of the corruption in the country he stated the bank has lost 344 million in the first 3 months of the current financial year he concludes that the bank does not even have the capacity to litigate the matter and recover the money the jawar phenomenon pm ably seems to have taken a calculated decision to play the ethnic card to perhaps appease the radicals within his party for certain his ethnic base is fired up and their expectations are high his colleague jawar mohamed another fiery demagogue who preaches ethnic and religious extremism has been invited from the usa minnesota state where he was based to operate legally in ethiopia oromo media network omn has millions of followers despite requests by millions of ethiopians for the closure of this media out let the pm has never criticized the station let alone order its closure abiy has allowed jawar mohamed the ceo omn legally registered in ethiopia to spread ethnic and religiously motivated hate speech pm abiy s tolerance of jawar is perplexing giving unchecked political power to extremists like jawar can only further exacerbate the already tense political environment some political observers suspect that there is either an explicit or implicit understanding between the pm and jawar if that is the case pm abiy is allowing jawar s extreme voice to influence the youth particularly in the oromo region in any other country jawar would have ended up in prison and prosecuted for crimes of incitements and possibly for terrorism as i wrote in an earlier article omn reminds me of radio television libre des milles collines rtlm the hate radio that was instrumental in the rwandan genocide it s stated aim was to create harmonious development in rwandese society but nothing could have been further from the truth it was set up and financed by hutu extremists to prepare the people of rwanda for genocide by demonizing the tutsi and encouraging hate and violence recognized the danger and asked for international help in shutting down the broadcast but it was impossible to persuade western diplomats to take it seriously they dismissed the station as a joke general romeo dallaire the canadian commander of the un peacekeeping operation in rwanda at the time of the genocide said simply jamming broadcasts and replacing them with messages of peace and reconciliation would have had a significant impact on the course of events his advice was ignored and the un and the international community regrets with great humility and embarrassment that had it acted earlier the genocide would probably have not taken place there is a red line between freedom of expression and hate speech oratory and incitement it is well established in the international legal instruments jawar has been caught on tape telling his crowd threatening christians like the interhamway of rwanda jawar has recruited young oromo s who call themselves querros to do the dirty work of killing plundering and creating an atmosphere of fear in the nation one ethiopian mekuria writes on ecdf website the image of querro youngsters brandishing machetes and other homemade weapons at was a pitiful sight to see it was reminiscent more of the notorious boko haram than the peaceful youngsters with their arms crossed over their heads in protest that ethiopians had come to love and appreciate querro youngsters are ethiopian who desire better than being reduced to doing the dirty work of others and getting tarnished in the process they have camp jawar to thank for it thousands of ethiopians have signed a petition to the minnesota attorney general and us attorney general to ban omn media for inciting ethnic violence in ethiopia and hold its director jawar mohamed responsible ethiopians are noticeably weary of prime minister abiy ahmed s government for failing to control widespread anarchism which seem to emanate from dual power exercised in the country since he became the prime minister of ethiopia the querro movement led by jawar mohammed is asserting de facto power and disrupting government power in different parts of ethiopia at will the way forward there is no way out of this looming tragedy without bold well considered decisions there will be severe consequences to these decisions but it is better to manage the consequences of the right and reasonable decisions which have the support of the majority than to manage a civil war and genocide pm abiy did not realize that people were getting tired with his lectures on love and medemer his slogan which means togetherness some people say that his preaching on love and medemer were all about optics that it was ploy to lure people to his side at times he seems not to be in the real world where love and medemer cannot be a policy of governing in political realism nation states are motivated by national interest the needs of the people such abstract moral values can be used to reinforce the pursuit of national interests but they cannot be policies these are mythical concepts and slogans that are not in the domain of real politics these are in the domain of our spiritual leaders political leaders have to be pragmatic the theory that a leader develops must be feasible and applicable pragmatism focuses on logic and reason and not abstract ideas what are needed are bold decisions pm should start by pulling himself out of ethnic politics and set an example and establish an ethiopian agenda it will not be an easy decision but is a necessary one that is the problem of leaders who assume power in time of crisis pm abiy has promised general election one year from now it is generally accepted that elections cannot take place under this situation even if it were possible to conduct elections under this same constitution which the people have fought for decades to remove it will not solve the complex problem of ethiopia many ethiopians fear that they have no options there are options people should not feel helpless options are born out of free open dialogue and discussions and this should start before it is too late non democratic or totalitarian governments like the one in place in ethiopia perpetuate fear and insecurity to make people believe that there are no other options except the status quo in such countries there are no readily available options such has been the history of ethiopia and so many other countries but that is no reason for not freely and openly discussing the problems in a very transparent manner options are born out of such discussions the institutions of civil society are the critical factors in making this possible civil society and free press have to campaign to create such forums and present options to the critical situation in ethiopia ethiopia needs a leader who campaigns for ethiopian unity and ethiopiawinet ethiopia needs a bold courageous imaginative and transparent president with humility ably came to power with simple solutions to the complex problems of ethiopia the rebellion over the last few years that cost the lives of many was all about transition to democracy ably has been given the chance through an overwhelming support unprecedented in ethiopian history he has failed to use this universal support to implement an agenda that rejects extremism and ethnic politics the problem of ethiopia was and is complex and needs a leader with a broad agenda wisdom and the capacity and willingness to consult dialogue and vigorously campaign for the values that binds the people of ethiopia it needs a leader that listens not one that lectures it needs a leader who can have a pool of experts around him her people of all ages and expertise people who can challenge him her and a leader willing to learn the pm wants to keep the constitution and the parliament and essentially keep the status quo he promised to make some changes to the constitution after election but that is not what the people want they want a new constitution and election in accordance with a new constitution prepared and approved by the people not vice versa as happened before under pm meles zenawi pm abiy wants to keep the constitution because that is the position of his party changing the constitution would most probably result in the abolishing of ethnic federalism which his party does not want pm abiy cannot serve two agendas his ethnic based party odp and the ethiopian agenda that is where wisdom and courage come to play in making the hard choices in the interest of peace and stability that is why the first and most palatable choice for the country is to for pm abiy to resign and the eprdf to select a leader who is non oromo and non amhara and lead the country to transition if pm abiy wants to save himself and the country the best exit for him is this option this will require a sober assessment of the situation and the consequences of not doing so if pm abiy and odp refuse to accept this option the pm can still go for a second option which i outlined in the road map i presented at the 7th vision ethiopia conference last december in addis abeba this requires the pm to abolish the constitution dissolve parliament and lead a transitional government by decree this will require from him to abandon the ethnic agenda take a unifying agenda and lead the transition through a road map established not by him but by a newly elected transitional peoples assembly these are bold moves and will require a lot of backdoor negotiations and open discussions with ethnic leaders and the public if this cannot be done the last resort is to demand the establishment of a transitional government and election under the auspices of the au the un and the international community and hope that the international community will pressure the parties to this dispute to cooperate knowing fully well the consequences of civil war in the country conclusion pm abiy ahmed was in rwanda last week on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the rwandan genocide i hope that he gets more aware of the consequences of a hate filled political environment like there was in rwanda just before the genocide of a million rwandese i was there 25 years ago it was the most sobering and most agonizing experience of my life i learnt my lessons i hope pm ahmed does come back with lessons learnt he was there as a un peacekeeper when he was probably in his early twenties he might have been too young or too busy with soldiering to learn about the root causes of the genocide now that he has people expect from him drastic decisions to prevent ethiopia from such a gruesome experience that was what president paul kagame did he took control of the country by making the necessary decisions to prevent further chaos and genocide his measures were unpopular in some quarters but he has made rwanda become one of the shining examples of success after a traumatic experience he was a tough leader the kind of leader that the situation needed he had equally capable people and committed people around him the rwandan genocide was preventable it was not the result of an uncontrolled hate and rage it was neither the wrath of god like in ethiopia it was the result of the deliberate choice of the elites who preached hate fear and division to keep them in power human rights watch of 2017 says they seized control of the state and used its machinery and its authority to carry out the slaughter like the organizers the killers who executed the genocide were not demons no automatons responding to ineluctable forces they were people who chose to do evil these few power holders transformed the strategy of ethnic division into genocide tens of thousands swayed by fear hatred or hope of profit made the choice quickly and easily they were the first to kill rape rob and destroy they attacked tutsi frequently and until the very end without doubt or remorse many made their victims suffer horribly and enjoyed doing so the rwandan genocide forced the world to recognize the potential of people to commit genocide even after the world unanimously declared loud and clear never again after the holocaust during the second world war leaders have enormous responsibilities during these fragile times in ethiopia they need more political wisdom and a huge sense of responsibility i was one those who wrote an article calling upon the people of ethiopia to rally around prime minister abiy like many people after closely looking at the situation i found it necessary to critique the polices of the pm over the last one year it is time to speak out i wrote then may 31 2018 in most ethiopian web sites in the end success will depend on the crossing of a fear barrier by dr ably and the people around him and his faith in the ethiopian people the ethiopian people have crossed that fear the question now is can pm ably and his team cross that fear and take the bold steps towards democratic transition if he fails he has no one to blame except himself the majority of the people are more united than ever and they will not hesitate to continue the struggle for a final and lasting outcome editor s note this article by dawit woldegiorgis

rex tillerson stood under a 32 foot pipe organ at the morton h meyerson symphony center in dallas explaining how the world worked it was may 2015 in the middle of an oil price crash and exxon mobil s earnings had fallen 46 percent compared with the same quarter the year before but tillerson then exxon s chief executive told his shareholders to be confident in the future oil and gas furnished billions of people including the very poor with cheap reliable fuel a fact not easily negated by a weak fiscal quarter our view reflects the reality tillerson said that abundant energy enables modern life later that morning a capuchin franciscan friar rose to speak a so called faith based investor michael crosby belonged to a tight circle of religious leaders who bought stock in public companies in the hope of exerting a moral influence on them while tillerson head of one of the largest oil companies in the world and a power broker in international geopolitics was accustomed to ignoring protesters crosby proved more tactical than most he submitted a motion to appoint a climate change expert to exxon s board which gave him the floor for several minutes then he laid into tillerson for having uttered not one word or syllable about climate change he asked why saudi arabia invested in solar panels while exxon spent nothing you re living out of the past he told tillerson at exxon s annual meetings as in most rooms where important business happens people speak in the subdued patter of corporate jargon language that camouflages the reality it describes so in the 2 000 seat auditorium it would have taken a moment to appreciate the gravity of what crosby was actually describing which was not a few numbers on a balance sheet but something closer to the fate of the species global energy consumption is rocketing upward every year the energy information administration expects it to climb another 28 percent within a generation hydropower wind and solar contribute about 22 percent of the total and their share grows yearly but the net amount of energy generated by hydrocarbons is growing yearly too it s all rising because demand is rising global hydrocarbon producers meanwhile have so much product in reserve that burning even half of it would leave us with slightly worse than heads or tails odds of staying under the two degree celsius threshold that according to climate models could bring mass famine drought flooding and fires from his spot beneath the pipe organ tillerson regarded the friar like it or not he said the world would depend on fossil fuels for the next several decades well into the middle of the century this was tillerson s line whenever people asked him about the future of hydrocarbons remind them how dependent they are and paint alternatives as childlike fantasies tillerson said the motion for a climate change expert would be defeated turning to renewables he dismissed them as a sucker s bet quite frankly father crosby he said we choose not to lose money on purpose the crowd at the symphony center showered him with applause three years later an irishman named declan flanagan chief executive of the renewables company lincoln clean energy was addressing his own shareholders in copenhagen when he delivered a cryptic announcement lincoln he said was going to build a solar farm in the permian basin the heart of west texas oil country with funding put up by a blue chip counterparty flanagan let this hang for a moment in the room while he breezed through a jargony update on regulatory matters finally he returned to the story i mentioned the blue chip counterparty he reminded his listeners that he said in his strong irish accent is exxon mobil between exxon s meeting in dallas and flanagan s announcement in copenhagen the oil giant had installed a new chief executive tillerson having exited for a brief sojourn in washington but had not experienced a change of heart no decision had been made to execute a bootleg turn away from hydrocarbons exxon s executives like everyone in the energy business had watched as the cost of renewable power tumbled ever lower in texas where a lattice of high tension power lines carried electricity from the bright windy plains of the far west and the panhandle to the thirsty cities below far from feeling worried exxon saw an opportunity fracking is a very electricity intensive method of extracting hydrocarbons by using solar energy for just a portion of its operations in texas exxon could save on electricity costs and keep more cash it could profit by turning renewable power back into the hydrocarbon power it existed to replace exxon s arrangement in texas reflects in miniature our national state of indecision about the best approach to climate change depending on whom you ask climate change doesn t exist or is an engineering problem or requires global mobilization or could be solved by simply nudging the free market into action absent a coherent strategy opportunists can step in and benefit in wily ways from the shifting landscape tax supported renewables in texas take coal plants offline but they also support oil extraction technology advances but not the system underneath faced with this volatile and chaotic situation the system does what it does best it searches out profits in the short term unlike almost every other future event climate change is 100 percent certain to happen what we don t know is everything else where or how or when or what the changes mean for facebook or pfizer or notes of chinese government debt navigating these thickets of complexity is theoretically what wall street excels at the industry prides itself on its ability to price risk for the whole economy to determine companies values based on their likelihood of generating earnings but traders are compensated on their quarterly or yearly performance not on their distant foresight it takes confidence to walk into your boss s office talking about sea levels in mozambique in 2030 when your colleague has a reason to short sell the turkish lira this week practically no one in the financial system is directly incentivized in the near term to worry about the biggest risk conceivable the simplest response is to keep investing in companies that like exxon conduct their business as usual while adapting where they can another response is to forget about the immediate term and go long on more sustainable bets al gore for instance whiles away his hours running a climate focused fund called generation investment management on a slightly

generation of climate profiteers schemers prowl these pages a london climate change fund invests in russian farmland whose value is expected to spike amid drought fueled global food crises betting on the same thing a former partner of a i g flies to sudan to strike a farmland lease deal with a rebel general a former c i a analyst buys billions of gallons of water in the american southwest and australia an israeli entrepreneur goes long on desalination plants some powered by coal funk notes what is odd about many of these climate plays which rely on such complex assumptions about the future is how myopic they seem they assume that the world will change around a stable fixed point american weather will curdle to such a degree that tennessee will become an incubator for malaria yet wall street banks and patent lawyers will saunter along as usual rising oceans will submerge coastal financial centers beneath several feet of saltwater yet commodities markets will pay top dollar for greenlandic uranium taken individually these assumptions sound dubious but as a whole they mirror what s happening on wall street each successive year incinerates the temperature figures of the previous one yet the stock market continues to break records an unsettling fact of wall street today is that some of the same people who accurately predicted the housing bubble are now describing another bubble whose collapse will make the financial crisis of 2008 look mild perhaps the most famous is jeremy grantham a founder of the boston based asset management firm g m o and a commander of the british empire in 2005 grantham began to write letters to his investors saying that the housing market appeared overleveraged in 2007 he warned of the first truly global bubble his latest prediction overshadows the preceding one we are he says in the midst of a historic period of mispricing because the global economy depends on hydrocarbons practically every asset in the world relates in some way to oil and gas grantham believes hydrocarbons will be priced or regulated into submission in light of that belief not only oil companies stock but practically everything else on the market looks falsely inflated in the last few years grantham has committed all but 2 percent of his personal fortune to funding projects energy storage pesticides lightweight cars that might help save us in the event of two degrees of warming in june 2018 he gave a keynote address at an investment conference in chicago the two speeches before grantham s were called take a balanced approach to sourcing cash flows and making sense of the multitude of multifactor etfs grantham called his speech the race of our lives you could call this presentation the story of carbon dioxide and homo sapiens he began then he spoke for nearly an hour about glacial runoff food scarcity and lithium batteries he explained how a turbine s efficiency increased exponentially with the length of its blades he said that offshore wind farms in the churning north sea could soon provide the cheapest power on the planet he rose to a techno utopian pitch speaking about our obligations to our grandchildren decency over profit even as he spoke lucidly about climate change grantham represented a tangled and confusing paradox perched as he was at the pinnacle of the market he was developing an acute sense of the market s failure to address the problem that most obsessed him yet he continued to help oversee a 70 billion firm which was the main source of his wealth if anyone was living inside the tortured contradictions between the market and the climate between our modern economy and its ultimate external cost grantham i thought was the person when i knocked on the door of his beacon hill townhouse at 8 45 in the morning on a friday the door swung open and grantham appeared on the staircase 80 and impish wearing a dark purple sweater over a pink and green striped shirt were you waiting long he said i followed him up into a second story living room where winter light flooded the bay windows falling on a hand painted dutch children s sleigh from the 17th century grantham took my coat then seated me on the couch every so often a heat pipe hissed somewhere behind me when grantham started his climate fund the grantham foundation in 1997 many asset managers on wall street viewed his work as a fringe pursuit there was an undercurrent of oh this is a load of he said during the past two years however the cavalcade of hurricanes droughts floods and displacements has made it impossible to maintain the same level of denial in the polite corporate circles that ring wall street this did not mean that climate based investment strategies had become popular it was the opposite no one was willing to risk all of his or her career units as grantham called them on climate the problem of doing it accurately is of course massive he said referring to betting on climate change it s a fast moving area with even more uncertainty than an uncertain world it s the cutting edge of uncertainty grantham s fund is going long on lithium and copper which he believes will form the vascular system of future renewable powered supergrids his confidence derives from an odd and specific conviction that sooner or later there will be a carbon tax and much of the market capitalization of the leading oil and gas companies will be erased you have a certainty he said it will happen or we ll be on our way to a failed civilization illustration by dadu shin it took me a moment to process what this meant grantham was saying that a bet on a future carbon tax was a sure thing because the absence of a carbon tax meant civilizational catastrophe if he were right he could make billions if he were wrong it wouldn t matter because the world would be on fire perfectly fine logic grantham said as the old radiators gurgled around him if grantham s logic was so perfect why didn t everyone see it it s often said on wall street that the stock market s prices reflect all available information an idea known as efficient market theory the idea has dominated the financial sector for half a century if it really were luminously obvious that a carbon bubble was about to explode the theory says that prices should reflect that in other words that grantham had no edge and his thesis made no sense they say everything s priced in i ventured complete grantham said then he embarked on a detailed explanation of why summarizing john maynard keynes s theory of career risk that it is better for reputation to fail conventionally than to succeed unconventionally before returning to present day wall street where asset managers impelled by short term self interest or outright denial feared to stick their necks out on climate related bets faced with such irrational behavior efficient market theory seemed wobbly it s because people are incompetent grantham continued it s because around 10 a m his cellphone crackled to life and a woman s voice said jeremy you have to get to your next meeting for a second grantham appeared almost mournful he held my coat up for me to put my arms through then he dashed downstairs into the snow the future site of the solar farm that lincoln is building for exxon the permian basin is hilly and semiarid with white caliche roads running toward the oil rigs and the nights punctured by the flames of natural gas flares sometimes when the wind picks up the highways smell like sulfur in recent years the permian became the most productive oil and gas field in the united states as advancements in horizontal drilling and fracking technology made it possible to shatter the tightly packed shale exxon chevron and their peers can now access natural gas and oil that was previously unreachable organic material that was deposited by surging oceans and subsiding land some 200 million years ago if the permian were a country it would rank among the largest oil states in the world every cliché about oil booms applies right now in the permian the 18 year olds earning six figures driving trucks the petrochemical ph d s living in man camps the overtaxed public schools and doctors offices unemployment in midland where permian energy companies have their headquarters and where george w bush was raised hovered this winter around 2 2 percent the fourth lowest metropolitan rate in the country yet the salient feature of the landscape is not the drilling infrastructure for one thing fracking takes place underground in 10 000 foot tunnels no more than eight inches in diameter and marked by only a single wellhead for another you can t keep your eyes off the wind turbines which in certain counties seem studded in every acre of ranch land texas produces more wind power than every other state in the country four times as much as the runner up california the texas power grid inspires awe every five minutes 24 hours a day the electric reliability council of texas calculates the cheapest power being produced from every kind of generator in the state then sends that electricity down the path of least resistance to its customers from ercot s perspective it doesn t matter whether the cheapest power comes from a solar panel or coal or whether the customer is a greenhouse or an oil rig last april texas consumed about 25 7 million megawatts of power of that 62 percent came from hydrocarbons and 27 percent from wind and solar electricity from all power sources feeds into the ercot grid like tributaries into a river though exxon s deal with lincoln is one of the most visible examples of a fossil fuel company using renewable energy in reality all the permian extraction outfits consume it whether or not they intend to simply because the grid is designed to serve it to them in 2017 demand for electricity rose 8 percent in west texas compared with 1 percent for the state s grid as a whole warren lasher the senior director of system planning at ercot told me that most of that change comes from oil and gas frosty gilliam an independent oilman in the permian greeted me at the reception desk of his office on a sparse stretch of business highway in odessa tex and beckoned me into a conference room decorated in what he described as a tuscan feel with marble hand troweled plaster and antique lamps sitting across from me at the darkly polished table gilliam was small and reticent with glinting eyes and short white hair gilliam grew up in west texas and earned his degree at texas a m in petroleum engineering graduating into the oil boom of the 1980s and easily finding a job at amoco the conglomerate that descended from john d rockefeller s standard oil in the late 80s as many small time oil and gas entrepreneurs used to do in texas gilliam started to build himself a business by scraping together mineral rights his company aghorn energy now controls some 1 100 wells in the permian making him a relative lightweight the atmosphere in the office was convivial and i hesitated to raise a question that would poison it but after half an hour i asked how he thought about climate change for 14 seconds gilliam stared at me across the table the hint of a smirk on his mouth now you re setting me up for a bunch of hate mail he said personally he didn t believe climate change was an important issue he said that when he saw data about rising sea levels or scorching temperatures he suspected it was falsified or manipulated in order to further a political agenda gilliam knew that many of the big energy companies were investing in renewables and he viewed their maneuvers skeptically the politically correct path is we re going to increase our renewable energy production by 10 percent a year o k but in reality they make their business selling oil and gas right for the most part gilliam spoke in the first person stressing to me that he was delivering only his own opinions toward the end of our time together though he switched into a collective voice to explain the reaction you d arouse if you showed up in west texas in a tesla we wouldn t tar and feather you he said we would just think well he has his opinion but our opinion is that there s not a problem the tension between the individual and the species between gilliam and the we runs through the heart of capitalism and always has in economics there is a theory called the lauderdale paradox which the scottish politician james maitland articulated in the early 19th century the theory says that capitalism undervalues public resources like air and water and soil because they are so plentiful and overvalues whatever is private and scarce a barrel of oil sells for 50 or 60 yet the emissions from that oil appear on no one s balance sheet when the paradox was first articulated the mill industry of england was transitioning from water to coal a long and contentious process coal allowed mill owners to site factories in cities where wages were lower and to run their machines at all hours but water was cheaper cleaner and more plentiful in newspapers and private clubs politicians and journalists fervently debated the merits of each fuel source and england hovered for decades on the knife s edge between two possible futures until as the scholar andreas malm recounts in fossil capital a history of early industrialism the more aggressive urban mill owners triumphed and the country switched to hydrocarbons seeing the whole problem like that as a result of an economic arrangement rather than an unsparing fate or a flaw in human character is exceedingly grim but also kind of optimistic one system can dominate for a while then another can sneak up and take its place at the far end of gilliam s conference table a surveyor s map lay open its corners secured by brown leather document weights the map depicted a mineral play in which gilliam had an interest containing perhaps a few hundred thousand barrels worth of oil provisional confidential was stamped in red along the bottom the map depicted the typical hydrocarbon infrastructure like well locations and the large container drums known as tank batteries shown as blue and yellow rectangles but a checkerboard of gray lines had been drawn over these features dividing the 3 700 acres into clean even squares i asked gilliam what the squares were solar farm he said casually

the number of americans filing applications for unemployment benefits dropped to a 49 1 2 year low last week pointing to sustained labour market strength that could assuage fears the economy was rapidly losing momentum other data on thursday showed producer prices increased by the most in five months in march amid a surge in the cost of gasoline but underlying producer prices remained soft the latest indication of tame inflation pressures that strengthen the federal reserve s decision to suspend further interest rate increases this year despite a tight labour market the economy s wheels continue to turn and any thought that growth was going to stop has to be reassessed said chris rupkey chief economist at mufg in new york fed officials are on the sidelines awaiting confirmation of what to do next initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 8 000 to a seasonally adjusted 196 000 for the week ended april 6 the labor department said that was the lowest level since october 1969 when the size of the labour market was about half of what it is now claims have declined for four straight weeks economists polled by reuters had forecast claims rising to 211 000 in the latest week the four week moving average of initial claims considered a better measure of labour market trends as it irons out week to week volatility fell 7 000 to 207 000 last week the lowest level since december 1969 the labour market s strength should allay worries of an abrupt slowdown in economic growth which gained traction after the u s treasury yield curve briefly inverted in late march the economy lost speed at the turn of the year reflecting fading stimulus from a 1 5 trillion tax cut package trade tensions between china and the united states and weak global growth data including retail sales and the trade deficit have improved raising the possibility that the anticipated slowdown in growth in the first quarter will not be steep goldman sachs is forecasting gross domestic

thursday the labor department said its producer price index for final demand rose 0 6 per cent in march the largest increase since last october after edging up 0 1 per cent in february in the 12 months through march the ppi rose 2 2 per cent after advancing 1 9 per cent in the 12 months through february economists had forecast the ppi climbing 0 3 per cent in march and increasing 1 9 per cent

core ppi increased 2 0 per cent in the 12 months through march that was the smallest annual increase since august 2017 and followed a 2 3 per cent rise in february data on wednesday showed consumer prices rose by the most in 14 months in march driven by more expensive gasoline but core inflation remained muted amid a plunge in the cost of apparel the recent consumer and producer price data don t point to any major acceleration or deceleration in inflation said joel naroff chief economist at naroff economic advisors in holland pennsylvania therefore the fed will feel no economic pressure to do anything minutes of the fed s march 19 20 policy meeting published on wednesday described inflation as muted though officials expected it to rise to or near the u s central bank s 2 per cent target the fed s preferred inflation measure the core personal consumption expenditures pce price index is currently at 1 8 per cent the minutes showed some fed officials believed the tame price pressures could be the result of low inflation expectations and also an indication that there was still slack in the labour market despite the very low unemployment rate last month gasoline prices shot up 16 0 per cent the most since august 2009 gasoline accounted for over 60 per cent of the 1 per cent rise in goods prices last month goods prices increased 0 4 per cent in february prices for health care services fell 0 2 per cent last month after rising 0 3 per cent in february the cost of hospital outpatient services fell by the most since july 2014 those health care costs feed into the core pce price index and suggested weaker inflation readings in february and march we look for moderation in the core pce price index to 1 70 per cent in february and 1 60 per cent in march said daniel silver an economist at jpmorgan in new york the commerce department will publish february and march pce price data later this month

the united conservative party ucp enjoys a strong lead in the opinion polls in the run up to alberta s april 16 provincial election and appears all but certain to unseat premier rachel notley and her new democratic party ndp after just one term in office the ucp was formed in 2017 through the merger of the far right socially and fiscally conservative wildrose party and the progressive conservatives alberta s traditional party of government it advocates ruthless austerity and massive corporate tax cuts and promotes alberta first regionalism and anti quebec chauvinism led by jason kenney one of the top ministers in stephen harper s decade long federal conservative government the ucp is a close ally of the federal conservative party and has links to anti immigrant and other ultra right forces including calgary based rebel media rattled by the post 2013 collapse of alberta s oil boom big business is turning to kenney and his ucp to mount a frontal offensive against the working class through massive social spending cuts the gutting of environmental and labour standards and corporate tax cuts the push for a ucp government in the country s fourth most populous province is part of a more general lurch right by the canadian bourgeoisie under harper and now trudeau canadian imperialism has pursued an ever more aggressive role on the world stage in close alliance with washington over the past nine months the corporate elite has propelled to power hard right anti immigrant governments in ontario under doug ford and in quebec under francois legault in answer to this sharp shift right which parallels developments in the us europe and around the world the working class must constitute itself as an independent political force and advance its own socialist solution to the capitalist crisis this requires implacable opposition to the purportedly progressive or left sections of the political establishment for decades whenever they have held office social democratic and liberal parties have invariably pursued pro austerity pro war policies and otherwise attacked the working class it is this that has opened door for right wing demagogues like trump ford and now kenney to hypocritically and cynically make appeals to the grievances and frustrations of working people unexpectedly swept to power in may 2015 on a wave of popular anger over inadequate public services a lack of affordable housing and rampant social inequality alberta s trade union backed ndp government has faithfully served the interests of big oil and corporate alberta it has imposed restraint on the province s overburdened health and education systems and pay freezes on public sector workers while imposing austerity on working people it shelved plans to increase the royalties paid by oil and natural gas producers and otherwise maintained the so called alberta low tax advantage and on the national stage notley and her ndp have functioned as close allies of the big business trudeau liberal government including pushing for the building of pipelines to tidewater none of this however has stopped kenney from denouncing notley and her ndp for purportedly failing to champion alberta and its oil industry kenney s party is mounting an alberta first regionalist campaign based on the claim that alberta is being short changed under current federal provincial arrangements even as the development of its oil sector is being thwarted by ottawa and other provinces this campaign includes an open appeal to anglo chauvinism kenney and his supporters routinely denounce the trudeau liberal government for its supposed favouritism to quebec and they accuse quebec itself of strangling alberta s economy by opposing an oil pipeline to the country s east coast even as it takes alberta s money a reference to quebec being the largest recipient of federal equalization payments kenney is vowing to use all the legal and fiscal means at the alberta government s disposal to overcome both popular and governmental opposition to new pipelines including holding a referendum to demand radical changes to the equalization program a ucp government is also committed to pressing for changes in how public health care is funded effectively eliminating any federal government role both the downsizing of equalization and the replacement of federal funding for medicare by increased provincial tax room are longstanding demands of the most rapacious sections of the ruling class they want to shatter what remains of minimum national standards for health care and other public services with the aim of transferring more wealth to the most privileged sections of society and promoting wholesale privatization neo conservatives have long advocated such a social counter revolution if their reactionary policy prescriptions are now on the verge of becoming alberta government policy it is because the province s ruling elite is angered and frustrated at the thwarting of its ambitions as a result of the fall in world oil prices and the shale oil driven emergence of the us as the world s biggest petroleum producer investment in the high cost alberta tar sands has collapsed determined to make good its losses alberta s corporate elite is intent on squeezing the working class and driving a harder bargain with its rivals and partners in the canadian bourgeoisie kenney and his ucp articulate this drive to increase the profits and wealth of the ruling elite in almost unvarnished fashion nevertheless they have been able to attract support from financially pressed current and laid off energy and construction industry workers as well as contractors small businessman and other middle class elements this is due above all to the ndp s rotten record since 2014 alberta s energy sector has been battered with tens of thousands of relatively well paid oil workers losing their jobs forced to accept temporary work or compelled to accept massive wage cuts consumer debt levels are at a record high and the housing market has collapsed with foreclosed houses remaining unsold for years while ndp leader rachel notley professed prior to becoming premier that her party would stand up for working people in alberta make corporations pay more taxes and oppose the development of oil pipelines due to environmental concerns the reality has been very different the ndp government has done nothing to assist workers hit hard by the crisis while endeavouring to ensure that big oil enjoys the best conditions possible for doing business on coming to power in 2015 notley s government adopted the outgoing progressive conservative pc government s budget and immediately froze public sector pay and imposed a hiring freeze in terms of notley s support for the big energy companies right wing calgary herald columnist don braid once observed premier rachel notley didn t just extend an olive branch to oil and gas leaders she brought the whole tree and shook it raining down petals of praise and friendship in shilling for big oil notley it should be noted has not shied away from playing the alberta regional card so right wing has been the notley government that she recently won praise from danielle smith who headed the far right wildrose party when it was alberta s official opposition smith compared notley to former pc premier peter lougheed who in 1971 founded the pc s 44 year long provincial governing dynasty if you think lougheed was alberta s best premier wrote smith in the herald i bet you are voting for notley that being said big business is overwhelmingly behind kenney licking its chops at the prospect of launching an all out onslaught on the public services and social programs on which millions of albertans rely the ucp 2018 policy declaration lays out plans to make alberta the lowest tax jurisdiction in canada by reducing taxes for large corporations to eliminate funding for abortion services and privatize health care to balance the budget in its first term through social spending cuts to construct hospitals and schools using the p3 public private partnership model to ensure equal funding for public and private schools and encourage the expansion of charter schools and to roll back the c 15 minimum wage to c 12 20 per hour to enforce its rabidly anti working class program the ucp is cultivating ties with right wing extremist and openly fascistic forces several ucp meetings have been attended by members of the neo fascist soldiers of odin which regularly organizes violent anti immigrant protests star ucp candidate and former harper government official caylan ford was forced to resign after online comments were publicized in which she defended the neo nazi demonstrators in charlottesville virginia in august 2017 that right wing populist forces are profiting from the social and economic crisis underscores the urgency of the working class intervening independently into political events with its own program workers in alberta seeking a political alternative to the province s right wing political establishment must turn to their class brothers and sisters across canada and internationally by taking up the struggle to put an end to the bankrupt capitalist system and replace it with a socialist society this above all requires the building of a new mass working class party committed to a socialist and internationalist program the socialist equality party

ranks nigeria low in sovereign wealth fund utilisation insists on tax reforms omololu ogunmade in abuja shola oyeyipo and martins ifijeh in washington dc nigeria and other african countries taking loans from china must ensure that the terms of borrowing are strictly in conformity with the paris club arrangements the international monetary fund imf said wednesday it also recommended that nigeria should embark on comprehensive tax reforms as a way to boost non oil revenue generation the washington based institution in the latest edition of its fiscal monitor report also ranked nigeria as the second worst country in the world in the utilisation of its sovereign wealth funds swf presenting the global financial stability report at the ongoing imf world bank spring meeting in washington dc the financial counsellor and director monetary and capital markets department imf mr tobias adrian argued that financial transactions between benefitting african countries and china does not usually align with the paris club arrangements he said while such funding was needed for development putting it to productive use remains an essential factor he said lending and capital flows from china are of course important for development on the one hand what is very important in those lending arrangements are the terms of the loans and we urge countries to make sure that when they borrow from abroad that the terms are favourable for borrowers in particular we tend to recommend that loans to countries should be conforming to paris club arrangements and that is not always the case in the case of loans from china also commenting on probity in the management of such loans which he said the imf is always focused on he noted that good governance is very important in making sure that capital flows are channelled to productive sources he added nigeria has been borrowing in international markets but we worry about rollover risks going forward on the other hand this is very good because it allows the country to invest more at the moment funding conditions in economies such as nigeria and other sub saharan african countries are very favourable but that might change at some point however there is the risk of whether these needs for refinancing can be met in the future adrian said the gfs report provides an in depth analysis of a number of specific vulnerabilities adding that in advanced economies corporate debt and financing risk taking have increased the credit worthiness of borrowers has deteriorated so called leveraged loans to highly indebted borrowers continue to be of particular concern in the euro area fiscal challenges remain in countries that have worries about the sovereign financial sector nexus if sovereign yields were to rise sharply banks with large holdings of debts could face significant loses insurance companies could also face loses on their bond portfolios he added he said the report showed that this was the time for decisive policy actions since vulnerabilities were increasing in a number of countries adding that there was no more room for complacency the intensification of trade tensions and a threat to disorderly practices have dented investors confidence policy makers should resist inward looking policies avoid policy missteps and resolve policy uncertainties he also called on policymakers to ensure post crisis regulatory reform was fully implemented adding that they should resist calls for rolling back reforms policy makers should develop and deploy macro prudential tools which can mitigate vulnerabilities and make the financial system more resilient he added he also called on emerging markets making volatile capital flows to limit their reliance on short term overseas debt and they should ensure they have adequate foreign currency reserves and bank buffers he also called for monetary policies to be data dependent and well communicated policy makers should act decisively to renew their commitment to open trade to discourage the build up of debt and to communicate clearly any shifts in monetary policy in the maturing credit cycle farsighted policy actions to reduce vulnerabilities can help avoid more painful adjustments in the future he said on his part the deputy director monetary and capital markets department imf fabio natalucci said it was of concern that the global economy is slowing down with market gyration over the last six months affecting risk assets adding that this has raised investor concerns about the health of the corporate sector if there is a severe slowdown in the growth of the global economy then it could be a problem for some firms particularly because credit quality has declined underwriting standards are weaker and debt levels are much higher he said insists on tax reforms for nigeria in a related development imf has recommended that nigeria should embark on comprehensive tax reforms as a way to boost non oil revenue generation the director fiscal affairs department imf mr vitor gasper told journalists during a media briefing at the imf world bank spring meeting yesterday that the body strongly recommend tax reforms to nigeria according to him tax reform in nigeria is a very important issue and one of our main recommendations for nigeria is the need for a comprehensive tax reform that would sustainably increase non oil revenue and the reason why that is needed is that nigeria has one of the lowest ratios of non oil revenue to gdp at around 3 4 per cent in the world and total tax revenue to gdp at around 8 percent is also very low compared to its peers because of that then the interest to tax ratio because the tax is so low is high and so a lot of the tax is crowded out not being able to be spent on important development needs and does nigeria have those needs of course big time as you know the needs for infrastructure and for spending on human capital are very large speaking on other areas beside the vat gasper noted that there is an emphasis also on improving excise taxes and i think there have been some steps in that direction but there is scope for expanding the coverage of excises to other goods and also higher rates on excises according to him another important area is aggressive streamlining of tax incentives and exemptions so there has been in nigeria an effort with the strategic revenue growth initiative looking at a comprehensive approach to tax reform and this is very welcome ranks nigeria low in swf utilisation the fund in its fiscal monitor report stated that qatar was the only country worse than nigeria on its swf index it stated it is critical to develop a strong institutional framework to manage these resources including good management of the financial assets kept in sovereign wealth funds and to ensure that proceeds are appropriately spent this remains a significant challenge in many resource rich countries that on average have weaker institutions and higher corruption the governance challenges of commodity rich countries that is the management of public assets call for ensuring a high degree of transparency and accountability in the exploration of such resources countries should develop frameworks that limit discretion given the high risk of abuse and allow for heavy scrutiny our debt profile sustainable says fg apparently responding to cautions against accumulated debt profile the federal government yesterday in abuja said the nation s debt profile is sustainable three world bank s chiefs the bank s chief economist africa albert zeufack lead economist africa punam chuhan pole and research manager michael toman while releasing africa s pulse a biennial analysis of african economies in the united states last week said whereas the african continent had been showing positive growth its debt profile had continued to rise at a high rate according to chuhan pole whereas nigeria s debt is low when compared to the gross domestic product gdp ratio the interest it pays on the debt has been very high and hence the need to exercise restraint according to nigeria s debt management office dmo the country s debt profile as at december 2017 stood at n21 73 trillion which is almost the double of the debt figure of n12 2 trillion as of june 30 2015 when the current administration took over but while answering questions from journalists after the weekly federal executive council fec meeting in the state house the minister of budget and national planning senator udo udoma said notwithstanding the astronomical rise in the country s debt profile in the last four years the profile is yet sustainable according to him all that is necessary is to broaden the scope of revenue generation adding that once the revenues increase debt profile will not be an issue he added that the government was currently working on ways to increase efficiency in revenue generation through tax collection and income generation from the nigeria customs service ncs insisting that there is no cause for alarm because every nation borrows with regards to our debts our debts are sustainable we do have a revenue challenge and we are focusing on that once the revenues come up it will be obvious that we don t have a debt problem at all we are working on a number of initiatives to increase our revenues we are looking at initiatives to widening the tax payments we are looking at initiatives to increase efficiency in collections we are looking at a single window which will help to increase efficiency customs collections we are looking at many different ways to improve revenues the debts are sustainable every nation borrows we are working on increasing our revenues he said udoma also said fec approved about n267 million to finance n power built programme under the social investment programme meant for the delivery of accelerated training and certification skills to 75 000 nigerians between the ages of 18 and 35 years he said while n122 800 000 of the sum is meant to implement the project in the south east the balance of n145 106 107 will be used for execution of similar project in the north west it aims to build a high crop of highly competent and skilled workforce of technicians artisans and service professionals who will be trained and tooled and transitioned annually to take up jobs such as electrical installation technicians plumbing and pipe fitting installers masons carpentry and gentry experts welders fabricators professional painters built technicians and so on in his own briefing the attorney general of the federation agf and minister of justice abubakar malami said the council also approved n2 849 billion for the installation of a digital process in the nation s prison system with a view to facilitating the process of decongesting the prisons arising from this the office of the attorney general presented a memo today yesterday which is web based automated inter connectivity system which is a digitalises way of decongesting the prisons the idea is to digitally connect all the prison formations to the office of the attorney general of the federation the police prison service and indeed selected courts the essence is to have an idea on the daily basis what obtains at our prisons across the nation so at a glance at a click of the button one can access what obtains at the prisons across the country for instance who is going to court today who is being released today those that have been in prison longer than their years of sentence who is in prison that is not meant to be there this will aid stakeholders in decision making on a daily basis through digital process of inter networking this is against an adhoc committee moving across the country to have physical presence in prisons malami said also briefing the minister of state for aviation senator hadi sirika said fec also approved n291 731 485 million for the procurement of memory access retrieval system to enhance safety in the nation s airports according to him the device which will enhance nigeria s laboratory capacity in accident investigation is a requirement of the international civil aviation organisation icao in their standard practices and applicable by local laws in the same vein the minister of federal capital territory fct mohammed bello said the council approved n368 million for the supply of water and field for abuja water board he also said fec approved another n226 million for the supply of 500 fire men suits for fct fire services

rttnews the major u s index futures are pointing to a slightly higher opening on thursday with stocks potentially benefiting from subdued buying interest once again continued optimism about a u s china trade deal may generate some buying interest although traders are also digesting a report from the labor department showing a much bigger than expected increase in producer prices while the bigger than expected increase in producer prices was largely driven by energy prices the data may still raise concerns about the outlook for inflation meanwhile a separate labor department showed first time claims for u s unemployment benefits once again slid to their lowest level in nearly 50 years in the week ended april 6th while buying interest was somewhat subdued stocks moved mostly higher over the course of the trading day on wednesday with the upward move the tech heavy nasdaq ended the session at its best closing level in over six months the dow bounced back and forth across

percent to 2 888 21 the higher close on wall street came after the minutes of the federal reserve s latest monetary policy meeting suggested the outlook for interest rates remains fluid the minutes said a majority of meeting participants expected that the evolution of the economic outlook and risks to the outlook would likely warrant leaving rates unchanged for the remainder of the year several of these participants saw the current target range for rates of 2 25 to 2 50 percent as close to their estimates of its longer run neutral level however the minutes noted participants continued to emphasize that future rate decisions would depend on their ongoing assessments of the economic outlook and potential risks several participants noted that their views of the appropriate target range for the federal funds rate could shift in either direction based on incoming data and other developments the minutes said some participants even indicated it would be appropriate to raise rates modestly later this year if the economy evolves as they currently expect with regard to the economic outlook the minutes said participants continued to view a sustained economic expansion strong labor market conditions and inflation near the fed s 2 percent target as the most likely outcomes over the next few years nevertheless participants generally expected the growth rate of real gdp this year to step down from the pace seen over 2018 to a rate at or modestly above their estimates of longer run growth the fed said a number of participants judged that economic growth in the remaining quarters of 2019 and in the subsequent couple of years would likely be a little lower than they had previously forecast the downward revisions were attributed to disappointing news on global growth and less of a boost from fiscal policy than had previously been anticipated the minutes noted that the meeting also featured continued discussions on options for transitioning to the longer run size of the balance sheet on the u s economic front the labor department released a report showing a spike in energy prices contributed to a slightly bigger than expected increase in consumer prices in the

by reuters by jason lange washington reuters the head of the international monetary fund on thursday panned an idea gaining currency in u s left wing circles that washington could borrow much more aggressively without harming the economy prominent politicians including senator bernie sanders a self described democratic socialist seeking the 2020 democratic presidential nomination and democratic u s representative alexandria ocasio cortez see the idea as a possible way to ramp up spending on social programmes the theory known as modern monetary theory has drawn rebukes from fiscal conservatives and many democrats as well imf managing director christine lagarde whose institution is tasked with rescuing countries stricken by economic crises appears to be aligned with critics who consider the theory naive we do not think that the modern monetary theory is actually the panacea lagarde said at a news conference during the spring meetings of the imf and world bank in washington lagarde said there might be a few situations in which vastly expanding debt would make sense such as when a country gets stuck in a deflationary spiral we do not think that any country is you know currently in a position where that theory could actually deliver good value in a sustainable way she said conventional economists across america s political spectrum argue the country is already on an unsustainable fiscal path with 22 trillion 17 trillion in outstanding federal debt and chronic deficits driven by social welfare programmes proponents of modern monetary theory hold that the u s government s monopoly over dollar issuance the printing press gives it the power to spend as much as needed to meet the full employment and inflation mandates currently tasked to the country s central bank imf chief economist gita gopinath said the u s dollar s dominant role in global finance might make it possible for washington to ramp up spending without immediately driving interest rates higher but she said america s growing spending commitments could eventually cause credit problems and that printing gobs of money to finance deficits could be disastrous very large amounts of it tend to be inflationary and they typically land countries into a crisis situation gopinath said in an interview with reuters reporting by jason lange additional reporting by david lawder editing by paul simao

the international monetary fund imf said yesterday that nigeria s debt to gdp ratio though good but risky and cannot be guaranteed going forward thank you for reading this post don t forget to subscribe debt gdp ratio compares the size of a country s debt to its economy with a view to determining the sustainability of the debt profile as well as the vulnerability of the economy to creditors and repayment obligations the ratio which stood at 21 1 percent early last year was projected to reach 25 percent at full year 2018 but the fund indicated that the range is already risky and cannot be guaranteed the fund also harped on the use of the funds borrowed saying that the channelling of the fund to productive sectors is necessary to achieve significant impact on the economy tobias adrian financial counsellor director of monetary capital markets development of imf at a press briefing on global financial stability report at the ongoing world bank imf 2019 spring meeting in washington dc usa stated nigeria s borrowing to gdp is still low but we cannot guarantee the risk going forward given the global economic downturn the prudent use of the money borrowed is significant to improving the economy while commenting on the global economy he stated that political and policy risks such as an escalation of trade tensions or a no deal brexit could affect market sentiment and lead to a spike in risk aversion he advised that amid rising downside risks to global growth policymakers should aim to avoid a sharper economic slowdown while keeping financial vulnerabilities in check policymakers should clearly communicate any reassessment of the monetary policy stance that reflects either changes in the economic outlook or risks surrounding the outlook this will help avoid unnecessary swings in financial markets or unduly compressed market volatility in countries with high or rising financial vulnerabilities policymakers should proactively deploy prudential tools or expand their macro prudential toolkits where needed these countries would benefit from activating or tightening broad based macro prudential measures such as countercyclical capital buffers to increase the financial system s resilience efforts should also focus on developing prudential tools to address rising corporate debt from nonbank financial intermediaries and maturity and liquidity mismatches in the nonbank sector regulators should also ensure that more comprehensive stress tests that include macro financial feedback effects are conducted for banks and nonbank lenders emerging market economies should ensure resilience against foreign portfolio outflows by reducing excessive external liabilities cutting reliance on short term debt and maintaining adequate fiscal and foreign exchange reserve buffers future outlook adrian further stated looking ahead there is a risk that positive investor sentiment could deteriorate abruptly leading to a sharp tightening of financial conditions this will have a larger effect on economies with weaker fundamentals greater financial vulnerabilities and less policy space to respond to shocks possible triggers include the following a sharper than expected growth slowdown could lead to tighter financial conditions as risk asset prices fall reflecting a weaker outlook for corporate earnings even as policies turn more accommodative an unexpected shift to a less dovish outlook for monetary policy in advanced economies could trigger a reprising in markets especially if investors realize that they have taken too benign a view on the monetary policy stance
rex tillerson stood under a 32 foot pipe organ at the morton h meyerson symphony center in dallas explaining how the world worked it was may 2015 in the middle of an oil price crash and exxon mobil s earnings had fallen 46 percent compared with the same quarter the year before but tillerson then exxon s chief executive told his shareholders to be confident in the future oil and gas furnished billions of people including the very poor with cheap reliable fuel a fact not easily negated by a weak fiscal quarter our view reflects the reality tillerson said that abundant energy enables modern life later that morning a capuchin franciscan friar rose to speak a so called faith based investor michael crosby belonged to a tight circle of religious leaders who bought stock in public companies in the hope of exerting a moral influence on them while tillerson head of one of the largest oil companies in the world and a power broker in international geopolitics was accustomed to ignoring protesters crosby proved more tactical than most he submitted a motion to appoint a climate change expert to exxon s board which gave him the floor for several minutes then he laid into tillerson for having uttered not one word or syllable about climate change he asked why saudi arabia invested in solar panels while exxon spent nothing you re living out of the past he told tillerson at exxon s annual meetings as in most rooms where important business happens people speak in the subdued patter of corporate jargon language that camouflages the reality it describes so in the 2 000 seat auditorium it would have taken a moment to appreciate the gravity of what crosby was actually describing which was not a few numbers on a balance sheet but something closer to the fate of the species global energy consumption is rocketing upward every year the energy information administration expects it to climb another 28 percent within a generation hydropower wind and solar contribute about 22 percent of the total and their share grows yearly but the net amount of energy generated by hydrocarbons is growing yearly too it s all rising because demand is rising global hydrocarbon producers meanwhile have so much product in reserve that burning even half of it would leave us with slightly worse than heads or tails odds of staying under the two degree celsius threshold that according to climate models could bring mass famine drought flooding and fires from his spot beneath the pipe organ tillerson regarded the friar like it or not he said the world would depend on fossil fuels for the next several decades well into the middle of the century this was tillerson s line whenever people asked him about the future of hydrocarbons remind them how dependent they are and paint alternatives as childlike fantasies tillerson said the motion for a climate change expert would be defeated turning to renewables he dismissed them as a sucker s bet quite frankly father crosby he said we choose not to lose money on purpose the crowd at the symphony center showered him with applause three years later an irishman named declan flanagan chief executive of the renewables company lincoln clean energy was addressing his own shareholders in copenhagen when he delivered a cryptic announcement lincoln he said was going to build a solar farm in the permian basin the heart of west texas oil country with funding put up by a blue chip counterparty flanagan let this hang for a moment in the room while he breezed through a jargony update on regulatory matters finally he returned to the story i mentioned the blue chip counterparty he reminded his listeners that he said in his strong irish accent is exxon mobil between exxon s meeting in dallas and flanagan s announcement in copenhagen the oil giant had installed a new chief executive tillerson having exited for a brief sojourn in washington but had not experienced a change of heart no decision had been made to execute a bootleg turn away from hydrocarbons exxon s executives like everyone in the energy business had watched as the cost of renewable power tumbled ever lower in texas where a lattice of high tension power lines carried electricity from the bright windy plains of the far west and the panhandle to the thirsty cities below far from feeling worried exxon saw an opportunity fracking is a very electricity intensive method of extracting hydrocarbons by using solar energy for just a portion of its operations in texas exxon could save on electricity costs and keep more cash it could profit by turning renewable power back into the hydrocarbon power it existed to replace exxon s arrangement in texas reflects in miniature our national state of indecision about the best approach to climate change depending on whom you ask climate change doesn t exist or is an engineering problem or requires global mobilization or could be solved by simply nudging the free market into action absent a coherent strategy opportunists can step in and benefit in wily ways from the shifting landscape tax supported renewables in texas take coal plants offline but they also support oil extraction technology advances but not the system underneath faced with this volatile and chaotic situation the system does what it does best it searches out profits in the short term unlike almost every other future event climate change is 100 percent certain to happen what we don t know is everything else where or how or when or what the changes mean for facebook or pfizer or notes of chinese government debt navigating these thickets of complexity is theoretically what wall street excels at the industry prides itself on its ability to price risk for the whole economy to determine companies values based on their likelihood of generating earnings but traders are compensated on their quarterly or yearly performance not on their distant foresight it takes confidence to walk into your boss s office talking about sea levels in mozambique in 2030 when your colleague has a reason to short sell the turkish lira this week practically no one in the financial system is directly incentivized in the near term to worry about the biggest risk conceivable the simplest response is to keep investing in companies that like exxon conduct their business as usual while adapting where they can another response is to forget about the immediate term and go long on more sustainable bets al gore for instance whiles away his hours running a climate focused fund called generation investment management on a slightly

in steel alloys the miners expect to find rich reserves of oil which they fully expect to burn the greenland play was best reported by mckenzie funk whose 2014 book windfall profiles the first generation of climate profiteers schemers prowl these pages a london climate change fund invests in russian farmland whose value is expected to spike amid drought fueled global food crises betting on the same thing a former partner of a i g flies to sudan to strike a farmland lease deal with a rebel general a former c i a analyst buys billions of gallons of water in the american southwest and australia an israeli entrepreneur goes long on desalination plants some powered by coal funk notes what is odd about many of these climate plays which rely on such complex assumptions about the future is how myopic they seem they assume that the world will change around a stable fixed point american weather will curdle to such a degree that tennessee will become an incubator for malaria yet wall street banks and patent lawyers will saunter along as usual rising oceans will submerge coastal financial centers beneath several feet of saltwater yet commodities markets will pay top dollar for greenlandic uranium taken individually these assumptions sound dubious but as a whole they mirror what s happening on wall street each successive year incinerates the temperature figures of the previous one yet the stock market continues to break records an unsettling fact of wall street today is that some of the same people who accurately predicted the housing bubble are now describing another bubble whose collapse will make the financial crisis of 2008 look mild perhaps the most famous is jeremy grantham a founder of the boston based asset management firm g m o and a commander of the british empire in 2005 grantham began to write letters to his investors saying that the housing market appeared overleveraged in 2007 he warned of the first truly global bubble his latest prediction overshadows the preceding one we are he says in the midst of a historic period of mispricing because the global economy depends on hydrocarbons practically every asset in the world relates in some way to oil and gas grantham believes hydrocarbons will be priced or regulated into submission in light of that belief not only oil companies stock but practically everything else on the market looks falsely inflated in the last few years grantham has committed all but 2 percent of his personal fortune to funding projects energy storage pesticides lightweight cars that might help save us in the event of two degrees of warming in june 2018 he gave a keynote address at an investment conference in chicago the two speeches before grantham s were called take a balanced approach to sourcing cash flows and making sense of the multitude of multifactor etfs grantham called his speech the race of our lives you could call this presentation the story of carbon dioxide and homo sapiens he began then he spoke for nearly an hour about glacial runoff food scarcity and lithium batteries he explained how a turbine s efficiency increased exponentially with the length of its blades he said that offshore wind farms in the churning north sea could soon provide the cheapest power on the planet he rose to a techno utopian pitch speaking about our obligations to our grandchildren decency over profit even as he spoke lucidly about climate change grantham represented a tangled and confusing paradox perched as he was at the pinnacle of the market he was developing an acute sense of the market s failure to address the problem that most obsessed him yet he continued to help oversee a 70 billion firm which was the main source of his wealth if anyone was living inside the tortured contradictions between the market and the climate between our modern economy and its ultimate external cost grantham i thought was the person when i knocked on the door of his beacon hill townhouse at 8 45 in the morning on a friday the door swung open and grantham appeared on the staircase 80 and impish wearing a dark purple sweater over a pink and green striped shirt were you waiting long he said i followed him up into a second story living room where winter light flooded the bay windows falling on a hand painted dutch children s sleigh from the 17th century grantham took my coat then seated me on the couch every so often a heat pipe hissed somewhere behind me when grantham started his climate fund the grantham foundation in 1997 many asset managers on wall street viewed his work as a fringe pursuit there was an undercurrent of oh this is a load of he said during the past two years however the cavalcade of hurricanes droughts floods and displacements has made it impossible to maintain the same level of denial in the polite corporate circles that ring wall street this did not mean that climate based investment strategies had become popular it was the opposite no one was willing to risk all of his or her career units as grantham called them on climate the problem of doing it accurately is of course massive he said referring to betting on climate change it s a fast moving area with even more uncertainty than an uncertain world it s the cutting edge of uncertainty grantham s fund is going long on lithium and copper which he believes will form the vascular system of future renewable powered supergrids his confidence derives from an odd and specific conviction that sooner or later there will be a carbon tax and much of the market capitalization of the leading oil and gas companies will be erased you have a certainty he said it will happen or we ll be on our way to a failed civilization illustration by dadu shin it took me a moment to process what this meant grantham was saying that a bet on a future carbon tax was a sure thing because the absence of a carbon tax meant civilizational catastrophe if he were right he could make billions if he were wrong it wouldn t matter because the world would be on fire perfectly fine logic grantham said as the old radiators gurgled around him if grantham s logic was so perfect why didn t everyone see it it s often said on wall street that the stock market s prices reflect all available information an idea known as efficient market theory the idea has dominated the financial sector for half a century if it really were luminously obvious that a carbon bubble was about to explode the theory says that prices should reflect that in other words that grantham had no edge and his thesis made no sense they say everything s priced in i ventured complete grantham said then he embarked on a detailed explanation of why summarizing john maynard keynes s theory of career risk that it is better for reputation to fail conventionally than to succeed unconventionally before returning to present day wall street where asset managers impelled by short term self interest or outright denial feared to stick their necks out on climate related bets faced with such irrational behavior efficient market theory seemed wobbly it s because people are incompetent grantham continued it s because around 10 a m his cellphone crackled to life and a woman s voice said jeremy you have to get to your next meeting for a second grantham appeared almost mournful he held my coat up for me to put my arms through then he dashed downstairs into the snow the future site of the solar farm that lincoln is building for exxon the permian basin is hilly and semiarid with white caliche roads running toward the oil rigs and the nights punctured by the flames of natural gas flares sometimes when the wind picks up the highways smell like sulfur in recent years the permian became the most productive oil and gas field in the united states as advancements in horizontal drilling and fracking technology made it possible to shatter the tightly packed shale exxon chevron and their peers can now access natural gas and oil that was previously unreachable organic material that was deposited by surging oceans and subsiding land some 200 million years ago if the permian were a country it would rank among the largest oil states in the world every cliché about oil booms applies right now in the permian the 18 year olds earning six figures driving trucks the petrochemical ph d s living in man camps the overtaxed public schools and doctors offices unemployment in midland where permian energy companies have their headquarters and where george w bush was raised hovered this winter around 2 2 percent the fourth lowest metropolitan rate in the country yet the salient feature of the landscape is not the drilling infrastructure for one thing fracking takes place underground in 10 000 foot tunnels no more than eight inches in diameter and marked by only a single wellhead for another you can t keep your eyes off the wind turbines which in certain counties seem studded in every acre of ranch land texas produces more wind power than every other state in the country four times as much as the runner up california the texas power grid inspires awe every five minutes 24 hours a day the electric reliability council of texas calculates the cheapest power being produced from every kind of generator in the state then sends that electricity down the path of least resistance to its customers from ercot s perspective it doesn t matter whether the cheapest power comes from a solar panel or coal or whether the customer is a greenhouse or an oil rig last april texas consumed about 25 7 million megawatts of power of that 62 percent came from hydrocarbons and 27 percent from wind and solar electricity from all power sources feeds into the ercot grid like tributaries into a river though exxon s deal with lincoln is one of the most visible examples of a fossil fuel company using renewable energy in reality all the permian extraction outfits consume it whether or not they intend to simply because the grid is designed to serve it to them in 2017 demand for electricity rose 8 percent in west texas compared with 1 percent for the state s grid as a whole warren lasher the senior director of system planning at ercot told me that most of that change comes from oil and gas frosty gilliam an independent oilman in the permian greeted me at the reception desk of his office on a sparse stretch of business highway in odessa tex and beckoned me into a conference room decorated in what he described as a tuscan feel with marble hand troweled plaster and antique lamps sitting across from me at the darkly polished table gilliam was small and reticent with glinting eyes and short white hair gilliam grew up in west texas and earned his degree at texas a m in petroleum engineering graduating into the oil boom of the 1980s and easily finding a job at amoco the conglomerate that descended from john d rockefeller s standard oil in the late 80s as many small time oil and gas entrepreneurs used to do in texas gilliam started to build himself a business by scraping together mineral rights his company aghorn energy now controls some 1 100 wells in the permian making him a relative lightweight the atmosphere in the office was convivial and i hesitated to raise a question that would poison it but after half an hour i asked how he thought about climate change for 14 seconds gilliam stared at me across the table the hint of a smirk on his mouth now you re setting me up for a bunch of hate mail he said personally he didn t believe climate change was an important issue he said that when he saw data about rising sea levels or scorching temperatures he suspected it was falsified or manipulated in order to further a political agenda gilliam knew that many of the big energy companies were investing in renewables and he viewed their maneuvers skeptically the politically correct path is we re going to increase our renewable energy production by 10 percent a year o k but in reality they make their business selling oil and gas right for the most part gilliam spoke in the first person stressing to me that he was delivering only his own opinions toward the end of our time together though he switched into a collective voice to explain the reaction you d arouse if you showed up in west texas in a tesla we wouldn t tar and feather you he said we would just think well he has his opinion but our opinion is that there s not a problem the tension between the individual and the species between gilliam and the we runs through the heart of capitalism and always has in economics there is a theory called the lauderdale paradox which the scottish politician james maitland articulated in the early 19th century the theory says that capitalism undervalues public resources like air and water and soil because they are so plentiful and overvalues whatever is private and scarce a barrel of oil sells for 50 or 60 yet the emissions from that oil appear on no one s balance sheet when the paradox was first articulated the mill industry of england was transitioning from water to coal a long and contentious process coal allowed mill owners to site factories in cities where wages were lower and to run their machines at all hours but water was cheaper cleaner and more plentiful in newspapers and private clubs politicians and journalists fervently debated the merits of each fuel source and england hovered for decades on the knife s edge between two possible futures until as the scholar andreas malm recounts in fossil capital a history of early industrialism the more aggressive urban mill owners triumphed and the country switched to hydrocarbons seeing the whole problem like that as a result of an economic arrangement rather than an unsparing fate or a flaw in human character is exceedingly grim but also kind of optimistic one system can dominate for a while then another can sneak up and take its place at the far end of gilliam s conference table a surveyor s map lay open its corners secured by brown leather document weights the map depicted a mineral play in which gilliam had an interest containing perhaps a few hundred thousand barrels worth of oil provisional confidential was stamped in red along the bottom the map depicted the typical hydrocarbon infrastructure like well locations and the large container drums known as tank batteries shown as blue and yellow rectangles but a checkerboard of gray lines had been drawn over these features dividing the 3 700 acres into clean even squares i asked gilliam what the squares were solar farm he said casually
how china overthrew some elements of socialism but remains an intellectual backwater of the world these five extracts from coase s how china became capitalist explain it very well china s ignorance of economics in 1980 was similar to india s ignorance of basic economics today during the cultural revolution china pursued a policy of self isolation in diplomacy and self sufficiency in the economy at the same time ideological monopolization in the name of pursuing pure socialism led to the stifling of intellectual development even marxism was held to be a finished theory rather than a developing school of thought as a result chinese knowledge of market principles was almost nil and what little did exist was often erroneous in 1980 milton friedman visited china and gave a week long intensive course in price theory to the brightest chinese bureaucrats one day at lunch after the lecture a minister from the ministry of materials distribution and his chief associate who were to form part of a chinese delegation to the united states wanted to know who they should talk to in the united states the first question they asked was tell us who in the united states is responsible for the distribution of materials how lee kuan yew changed china sadly all the clowns of india think they know more than lky the past master of governance there is no doubt that such intensive exposure to the outside world particularly to the west served as a powerful catalyst for changes in chinese attitudes to the market to capitalism and to economic development for example when visiting singapore in november 1978 deng inquired in detail about the working of foreign direct investment and its contribution to the rise of singapore s economy to the surprise of his host deng openly admitted mistakes the communist government had made and earnestly sought advice from lee kuan yew singapore s founding and long serving prime minister on how to improve the chinese economy more than a decade later lee still remembered his meeting with deng i had told deng over dinner in 1978 in singapore that we the singapore chinese were the descendants of illiterate landless peasants from guangdong and fujian in south china whereas the scholars mandarins and literati had stayed and left their progeny in china there was nothing that singapore had done that china could not do and do better he stayed silent then when i read that he had told the chinese people to do better than singapore i knew he had taken up the challenge i quietly tossed to him that night fourteen years earlier how china developed a desire to learn from others a desire that indian socialists never developed being ultra arrogant and full of themselves after visits to hong kong macau singapore japan the united states and western europe in 1978 and 1979 chinese officials had been shocked by the astonishing technological advancement and economic efficiency achieved by the capitalist system and the pleasant living conditions enjoyed by the middle classes they were forced to appreciate the extraordinary strength of capitalism in innovation technological as well as institutional a point actually made a long time ago by marx himself chinese liberation of prices in 1990s was critical to its conversion to capitalism the most serious defect of china s economic reform in the 1980s was the lack of price reform which had resulted in chaotic pricing massive resource misallocation and economic disorder in 1992 the chinese government took a series of decisions that would ultimately abolish price control the list of prices for raw materials capital goods and transportation services to be set by the central government was reduced from 737 to 89 it would be further reduced to 13 in 2001 63 the market for grain was fully liberalized nationwide at the end of 1992 the national planning commission halved the mandatory production plan for 1993 leaving more room for market forces to operate china also significantly reduced the import tariffs for more than 3000 items beginning at the end of 1992 the process of price deregulation would continue throughout the coming years in 1993 the dual pricing practice used for steel and machinery products was ended in 1994 dual pricing for coal and crude oil ended by 1996 the dual track pricing for industrial inputs became history the share of producer goods transacted at market prices increased steadily from almost zero in 1978 to 13 percent in 1985 46 percent in 1991 and 78 percent in 1995 china is a keen follower of lky s singapore model and the world s best economists the next major reform in the 1990s in china was of its state enterprises which moved to the singapore tamasek model with the endorsement of a market economy as the ultimate goal for china s economic reform in 1992 the proponents of enterprise reform gained a new mission turning state owned enterprises into independent autonomous and market oriented economic entities it was reported that in 1988 about 10 9 percent of state enterprises were insolvent the rate rose to 16 percent in 1989 27 6 percent in 1990 over 30 percent in 1993 and 40 percent in 1995 a survey of state enterprises in 16 big cities including shanghai tianjin shenyang and wuhan jointly conducted by nine central government ministers and bureaus in 1994 revealed that 52 2 percent of state enterprises were insolvent at the same time the share of state enterprises in industrial production plummeted from 77 6 percent in 1978 to 54 6 percent in 1990 and 34 percent in 1995 chinese economists drew much theoretical inspiration from a growing school of thought in modern economics the economics of property rights as mainly developed by armen alchian steven cheung harold demsetz douglass north as well as ronald coase zhucheng a small county level city in shandong quietly privatized 272 out of its 288 state or collective enterprises this happened between late 1992 and mid 1994 chen guang who became mayor of the city in 1991 and party secretary in 1993 oversaw this radical episode of enterprise reform as mayor chen quickly found out that the majority of state enterprises were actually insolvent and had to rely upon government subsidies to survive the local government however could no longer afford to subsidize the loss making state enterprises after most of the state enterprises being privatized or simply closed chen faced little resistance in abolishing five government bureaus formerly in charge of administering state enterprises in january 1996 a delegation of twenty three members from nine different ministries was sent by zhu rongji premier of the state council to visit zhucheng for a week their report enthusiastically approved the zhucheng experience of restructuring state enterprises in march zhu himself led a delegation to zhucheng visiting many restructured enterprises after his visit zhu pointed out some shortcomings in zhucheng s enterprise reform but praised it as a model that deserved serious consideration for other cities to reform their state enterprises most of which had been the pride of china during mao s time officials from shanghai visited several western european countries to study how they managed their state assets many small and medium sized state enterprises were simply liquidated as a result their number was cut dramatically even those remaining were separated from direct government control and put in the hands of a few state asset management companies in principle the state asset management company would behave like a private investor subject to certain political constraints moreover all state asset companies reported directly to the state assets management committee slashing the bureaucratic red tape that had plagued state enterprises in the past the practices of both zhucheng and shanghai were incorporated into the decision on issues regarding the establishment of a socialist market economic system which was passed at the third plenum of the fourteenth central committee of the party in november 1993 this meant that those practices were now part of the main approach to reforming state owned enterprises the strategy was then called holding on to the big and letting go the small the third main market reform in china was creation of joint stock companies in 1997 and privatisation as a policy at the fifteenth national congress of the party in 1997 the role of the non public sector was stressed as an important component of the socialist market economy joint stock companies were officially recognized privatization was no longer seen as undermining socialism afterward the state owned enter prises went through a drastic process of restructuring and downsizing resulting in massive layoffs china s failure to privatise or let go the higher education sector is holding it back its achilles heel and explains why it will remain a third tier country in comparison to the usa most chinese universities and the educational system in general still remain under state control it is here that the most serious deficiency of china s market reform reveals itself this deficiency stands at the root of the troubling symptoms we have identified above as well as other shortcomings in the chinese economy the most significant change in chinese universities in the past few decades of rapid market reform has been the commercialization and expansion of higher education at the end of the 1980s chinese universities started to enroll fee paying students who otherwise would not have been able to attend college because of their poor performance at the national college entrance examination as a result the state ceased to be the only funder of higher education the pace of commercialization and expansion of the higher education sector picked up greatly in the 1990s giving rise to what is widely referred to as china s great leap in higher education in 1995 only 5 percent of age group 18 22 had access to higher education by 2007 that had increased to 23 percent the fatal organizational flaw of chinese universities is their lack of autonomy the majority of chinese universities remain primarily funded by the state and under the strict control of the ministry of education in 1995 and 1998 the chinese government launched project 221 and project 985 with the aim of building up a few world class universities and critical academic disciplines 85 the ministry of education introduced the piece rate compensation system to chinese universities an incentive scheme that had served well in manufacturing firms university professors are evaluated and rewarded according to their publications the total compensation of a professor typically consists of a basic salary which is tied to his or her academic rank and a performance based reward which is mainly dependent on publications in most cases the basic salary is set so low that all professors have to publish to earn a decent living not surprisingly this scheme which is now widely applied has turned chinese professors into publication machines given the pervasive administrative meddling of the state it is not difficult to understand the mediocre performance of chinese universities as milton friedman remarked the surest way to destroy an industry is to protect it with state monopoly the state monopoly in china has severely curtailed the production of ideas administrative interference is so severe that even in areas such as physical and biological sciences and technology where the impact of political ideology is limited a free market for ideas hardly exists people of critical thinking and independent thought the most valuable human assets in any society often find themselves labeled political dissidents in turn political dissidents often find themselves deemed to be anti party or anti socialism a charge that can end their career if not their life the lack of a market for ideas is directly responsible for the lack of innovation in science and technology the achilles heel in china s growing manufacturing sector

with these remarks i d like to now turn it over to john john standley chief executive officer thanks byron and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today during the fourth quarter we continued generating critical momentum in key areas of our business while also taking important steps to position rite aid for future success to help us build on this momentum we have also developed a comprehensive business strategy that specifically defines our top priorities and provides rite aid with a clear path to the future for long term sustainable growth i ll be discussing the strategy in more detail later in today s call as you know operational efficiency has been one of our top priorities to that end we recently took an important step forward by announcing a restructuring to right size our organization as the tsa with wba winds down as announced we re reducing managerial layers and consolidating roles throughout our organization to align current operations with our new footprint we expect annual cost savings of about 55 million from the restructuring with approximately 42 million to be realized in fiscal year 20 this is important because we expect tsa revenue to be lower by approximately 40 million this year as we complete this restructuring we re also implementing a leadership transition the board has initiated a search for a new ceo and i will stay throughout that process to ensure a smooth transition while changes like these are never easy this restructuring represents a critical step in becoming a more efficient company that is better positioned to deliver value in addition as previously announced rite aid stockholders have approved a reverse stock split of the company s outstanding shares of common stock our board of directors has now approved the implementation of the reverse stock split at a ratio of 1 for 20 rite s common stock will begin trading on a split adjusted basis on the new york stock exchange as the market open on april 22 2019 implementation of the reverse stock split should enable us to regain compliance with the new york stock exchange listing requirements in terms of our results for the quarter while adjusted ebitda met our expectations we re still not where we want to be in terms of performance there s no doubt that we re dealing with a very challenging environment for retail and pharmacy reimbursement rates and that these trends affected our results at the same time we also generated positive results in critical areas of our business in the retail pharmacy segment in addition to our success with our various script growth initiatives over the past few quarters we also administered a record number of flu shots and drove strong growth in ancillary immunizations and despite a mild cough cold and flu season we increased same store pharmacy sales and prescription count for the third consecutive quarter in our pharmacy services segment increased medicare part d enrollment helped drive a 1 2 increase in revenue for the quarter and a 4 5 million increase in adjusted ebitda as you know we recently announced the addition of ben bulkley to our team as ceo of envisionrxoptions ben is an outstanding leader with a proven track record for driving results through innovation and operational excellence we re excited to have him as part of our team and he will be joining us later in the call to provide additional details on envisionrxoptions business while we know there are opportunities for organic growth in our business we also know the dynamics of retail and healthcare are changing rapidly and that it s critical to develop a strong plan for our long term future as i alluded to earlier we spent significant time over the past several months taking a close look at our go forward strategy we ve analyzed all aspects of our business including engaging with outside consultants to ensure that rite aid has the best possible strategy for achieving long term sustainable growth this included a thorough analysis of the marketplace so that we can better understand the needs of pharmacy customers and tailor our mix of services and products to deliver an even higher level of convenience and care as a result we have developed a clear path to the future that will position rite aid to capitalize on its strongest capabilities and core competencies to help improve health outcomes for more patients our strategy focuses on three top priorities first we will leverage and more clearly align our unique capabilities like the expertise of our pharmacists health dialog rediclinic and envisionrxoptions to help payers in delivering a higher level of care to patients specifically we know there s more that we can do to work with payers to drive positive health outcomes for chronic and poly chronic patients we already have related experience in this area following our pilot of rite aid health alliance which saw us partner with local physicians and hospitals our health alliance pilot provided us with some key learnings that we can now apply as we look to make a stronger play in the value based care market second we are reimagining our front end offer we have the right selection of products and services to meet the needs of our target consumers this will include executing a full sku optimization program the continued migration of our product mix to have a greater emphasis on health and wellness and the identification of new services we can offer at the store level third we are continuing our efforts to fundamentally transform our processes and procedures to ensure strong cost discipline unlock capacity and achieve peak operational efficiency in addition to the organizational restructuring i mentioned earlier we ve identified specific expense reduction initiatives in areas such as store operating expenses advertising and non headcount backoffice expenses while we have always been focused on these areas our thorough review process identified further opportunities to reduce complexity in our business and drive efficiency we have also identified opportunities to improve working capital these efforts will drive additional savings that we will use to make critical strategic investments for future growth with our strategy in place we re excited to be fully focused on building momentum for our business going forward we re also excited to have a number of dynamic and talented leaders taking on new roles within our organization to help us execute and strengthen our go forward strategy matt schroeder who you ll hear from later in this call is our new chief financial officer he s an experienced member of our team who knows our business and will do a great job of putting rite aid in the best possible financial position to succeed jocelyn konrad is our new executive vice president of pharmacy and retail operations jocelyn is a licensed pharmacist with a significant experience in clinical service and value based care initiatives with her additional front end responsibilities jocelyn will be an excellent leader to further strengthen our one store one team culture in the field and stores and finally bryan everett has been named rite aid s new chief operating officer bryan s leadership has been critical in keeping our team focused on operational priorities over the past several years his passion for our business and vision for our future have earned him the trust and respect of our rite aid team i m excited to see him take on additional responsibilities in his new role and look forward to working with him as we focus on positioning rite aid to deliver value over the long term with that at this time i d like to introduce bryan to provide an update on our key initiatives and further details about our go forward initiatives bryan bryan everett chief operating officer thank you john and good morning everyone i ll start by saying that i m very excited for the opportunity to take on additional responsibilities and lead in this new role as a team we have made some good progress in improving our business and while we still have work to do heading forward i m confident in our rite aid team and strategy and optimistic about our future as an organization in terms of our key initiatives as john said we ve driven same store pharmacy sales and prescription count growth for three consecutive quarters a key factor has been our success with immunizations as we delivered a record of more than 2 3 million flu shots and growth of 78 in ancillary immunizations in fy 19 we also ramped up our investment in prescription file buys by spending a total of 45 million compared to 29 million in the prior year for this year we have allocated 60 million for prescription file buy opportunities also during the year we completed 134 wellness remodels and this highly successful format now represents nearly 72 of our chain the wellness stores continue to outperform the rest of the chain in terms of both same store front end sales and prescription count and they will continue to play a key role as we aggressively test innovation to drive even better customer experiences our wellness rewards program also continues to play a key role in delivering value to our customers we have over 13 million active wellness rewards members and we will continue leveraging this very popular program to provide a higher level of personalized marketing that drive sales and customer loyalty the key initiatives i ve mentioned provide a strong foundation from which to build as we focus on accelerating our transformation in fy 20 to support these efforts we have identified several key areas of opportunity we understand that providing best in class clinical pharmacy services represents a critical opportunity to deliver a higher level of care to our customers while also positioning rite aid for sustainable growth in the emerging value based healthcare marketplace a great example is our launch of rite care in fy 19 rite care is a state of the art tool that provides our pharmacists with real time alerts for clinical service opportunities without having to access a separate application to position us in delivering a higher level of care we must continue finding ways to operate more efficiently so that we can free up additional time for our pharmacists to provide personalized services to our patients this includes a continued focus on increasing predictive refills through programs like automated courtesy refills and one trip refills and other workflow improvements to reduce our cost to fill we will also expand on our central fill capabilities throughout the year tools like these will help us continue to execute our aim strategy aim stands for adherence immunization and medication therapy management or mtm and these services represent our gateway into value based care and in recent years we ve made significant progress in expanding these offerings by gaining efficiencies in the pharmacy and providing best in class services through aim we will be in an even better position to further expand our offering and begin working with key payer partners to close gaps in care we must also deliver on our priority to be a low cost provider that s why it was so critical to lock in the best possible drug cost which we have accomplished through our recent 10 year agreement with mckesson we will also continue working with payer partners to manage reimbursement rate pressure with a focus on gaining access to additional limited networks heading forward in the front end we are completing a comprehensive evaluation of our business to better support our target consumer this includes completing a sku optimization and remerchandising key categories to better meet the needs of our customers it also includes introducing additional better for you items especially in consumables and beauty one of our biggest areas of focus will be growing our own brand penetration over the next few years we believe this area presents enormous potential and our go forward plan includes introducing new items enhancing our product mix and additional consideration to how we market and promote these items early this fiscal year we ll be relaunching our best selling own brand of otc products rite aid pharmacy and we re also in the final stages of repositioning the thrifty ice cream brand and expanding sales to additional states in addition we ve heard from many customers about their interest in purchasing cbd products in response to this interest this month we will begin piloting the sale of cbd creams lotions and lip balms at rite aid stores in oregon and washington to better meet the needs and preferences of our customers in those communities as we analyze and evolve our front end business we ll also be examining our marketing to make sure that we are targeting the right opportunities to grow our business at the same time we know that today s retail consumer is looking to shop and engage with brands in a number of different ways and as a team we re highly focused on meeting these needs and are exploring various options to further enhance our omni channel capabilities including making key strategic investments we will significantly grow our e commerce business again this year we will continue developing our mobile capabilities and further expand our self checkout pilot expect to see more self checkouts at rite aid stores in the coming year additionally we are also exploring mobile checkout solutions we continue to offer same day prescription home delivery in the majority of our markets at no charge for our wellness gold and silver members this service has been very well received and continues to grow we see further expanding home delivery as a key opportunity which is why we re also partnering with instacart a technology driven on demand service to pilot another convenient option for home delivery we will continue to refine and enhance our home delivery capability in the months to come we are also excited to be partnering with amazon to introduce amazon lockers to more than 900 rite aid stores over the next few months to give customers another option to pickup or return their amazon packages this effort will bring additional traffic into our rite aid stores heading forward we ll continue to look for new ways to engage with customers both in store and online to create a seamlessly connected customer experience finally it s really important that we continue to thoroughly understand current trends and how they relate to the products that we sell to that end we are concerned about some of the alarming statistics regarding the use of e cigarettes and vaping products by children and teens according to the centers for disease control and prevention tobacco use among our nation s youth grew nearly 38 between 2017 and 2018 this has been driven largely by an increase of e cigarette use which over the past year has increased 78 in the high school demographic and 48 for middle school age children while many feel these products are beneficial to those of legal age who are trying to quit the use of tobacco we have made the decision to remove all electronic cigarettes and vaping products from our offering at all rite aid stores we will remove this product over the next 90 days in addition we will continue to rigorously enforce our chainwide id all policy that requires identification to purchase any age restricted item we will also continue evaluating our entire front end offering to ensure that we are meeting both the needs and the expectations of our customers before i conclude i wanted to take a moment to sincerely thank our rite aid store associates our field leaders our distribution center partners and corporate team members for all they ve done this year i can t say enough about how our team has been able to stay focused on providing great service to our customers as we ve navigated through some significant challenges it s truly an honor to be taking on a new leadership role as part of this extraordinary team as i said earlier our team recognizes that we have important work ahead of us in order to continue positioning our company for sustainable long term growth at the same time we re ready to do this important work and to continue delivering great experiences to our valued customers i believe in our team i believe in our brand and i m excited about our company s future i m also looking forward to working with the other leaders who are taking on new roles within our organization and this includes ben bulkley our

well as being easy to work with our growth will always be based on providing better and better levels of service delivering innovative products and of course disciplined execution i would like to provide some additional details to the results on the quarter which included 4 5 million increase in adjusted ebitda primarily driven by continued growth in medicare part d enrollment we are very pleased with the growth of our med d business and all told we now have roughly 635 000 enrolled part d members for plan year 2019 in terms of open enrollment for the plan year 2019 we added 95 000 new lives with our larger than expected dis enrollment in geographies or rite aid divested stores resulting in approximately 22 000 net new med d members we expect med d membership to grow over 10 for the plan year 2019 the strategic decisions over the last few years are beginning to pay off most notably our number of chooser ph members in our plans has increased from 77 000 in calendar 2016 to 352 000 today we re also excited about the progress in the current year 2020 commercial selling season with several regional and health plan rfps in house a number of finalist opportunities and a new regional health plan alliance already in place all told we ve won new commercial clients during the 2020 selling season that add over 220 000 lives and have several exciting prospects in the pipeline envision

proposition for payers as rite aid positions its unique assets to drive the greatest value to the enterprise we look forward in working together and bringing this vision to life by driving positive patient health outcomes and creating even greater value in today s healthcare marketplace thank you for your time now i ll turn it over to matt schroeder for more information on our financial results matt matt schroeder chief financial officer thanks ben and thanks to everyone for joining us today on this morning s call i ll provide a recap of the refinancing of our credit facility that we completed in december walk through our fourth quarter results and review our fiscal 2020 guidance on december 20 2018 we completed the refinancing of our senior secured credit facility as a result of this refinancing we replaced our 2 7 billion revolving credit facility with the new facility that includes a 2 7 billion revolving credit facility and a 450 million term loan these new credit facilities are scheduled to mature in december of 2023 with a springing maturity at december 31 2022 if we have not repaid or refinanced our 6 125 notes due in april of 2023 before that date the interest rate on the revolver has improved by 25 basis points over the old revolving credit facility our covenants under the new senior secured credit facility remains substantially unchanged this refinancing pushes out our debt maturities until 2023 and increases our current liquidity to 1 7 billion this important refinancing strengthens our balance sheet and gives us the flexibility to make investments necessary to execute our growth plan as well as provide the time needed to execute on our strategy now i ll turn to a review of our fourth quarter results revenues for the quarter were 5 4 billion which were essentially flat to the prior year s results net loss from continuing operations was 255 6 million or 0 24 per share versus a net loss of 483 7 million or 0 46 per share in the prior year s quarter current year net loss was impacted by a charged income tax expense to record a 197 million increase in our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets i ll point out that our current federal tax affected nol carry forward is 225 million and with none of our federal nols expiring until fiscal 2029 this represents a valuable shield against future federal cash taxes adjusted net loss in the current quarter was 13 3 million or 0 01 per share versus adjusted net loss of 7 8 million or 0 01 per share in the prior year quarter our decline in adjusted net loss was primarily due to a decline in adjusted ebitda which was 134 1 million in the current quarter compared to 154 8 million in the prior year quarter retail pharmacy segment revenue for the quarter was 3 97 billion which was 28 million lower than last year s fourth quarter our increase in comparable store sales was more than offset by the impact of the 82 underperforming stores that we have closed since the end of last year same store sales increased 70 basis points in the quarter front end same store sales were down 1 9 but pharmacy same store sales increased 2 1 with same store script count up 80 basis points on a 30 day adjusted basis the increase in script count reflects the continuing impact of our pharmacy initiatives including our immunization program and our focus on improving clinical capabilities we are pleased that we were able to grow scripts this quarter despite cycling a very strong flu season in the prior year s fourth quarter front end sales were negatively impacted by soft performance in tobacco due to regulation changes that prohibited the sale of tobacco in certain new york stores beginning january 1 and in over the counter cough cold and flu products due to cycling last year s strong flu season total retail pharmacy segment gross profit dollars in the quarter were 111 million lower than last year s fourth quarter and gross margin was 259 basis points lower as a percent of revenues lifo expense increased 53 2 million due to higher levels of pharmacy inflation in the current year adjusted ebitda gross profit was unfavorable to last year s fourth quarter by 54 5 million and a 117 basis points worse as a percent of revenues pharmacy gross profit was worse than prior year s fourth quarter on a dollar and rate basis due to reimbursement rate pressure that we were not able to offset with generic drug purchasing efficiencies and comparable store prescription growth distribution expenses were unfavorable due partially to the realignment of stores within our distribution network front end gross profit was worse than the prior year s fourth quarter due to decreases in front end sales but front end margin improved due to good markdown management and favorable shrink results retail pharmacy segment sg a expenses for the quarter were 37 8 million lower than last year s fourth quarter while sg a rate as a percent of revenues improved by 76 basis points adjusted ebitda sg a was 29 1 million better than the prior year fourth quarter and 55 basis points better as a percent of revenue our sg a improvement was driven by an increase in tsa fee income from wba and lower payroll and advertising expense our pharmacy services segment had revenues of 1 5 billion which was an increase of 18 million or 1 2 primarily due to an increase in our medicare part d membership adjusted ebitda for the pharmacy services segment of 37 8 million was 4 5 million higher than last year s fourth quarter adjusted ebitda of 33 3 million the increase in revenue was partially offset by increases in sg a expense as we invest for current year and future growth our cash flow statement for the quarter shows a use of cash from operating activities of 216 million during the fourth quarter we remitted 180 million of the payment for our 2017 plan year cms receivable to the reinsurer which had a negative impact on our working capital we did not utilize reinsurance for the cms receivable in 2018 we also saw a decrease in accrued interest due to the payoff of several of our debt instruments with proceeds from the wba asset sale during the year other differences were due to timing in receivables and payables our debt balance net of cash was approximately 3 3 billion at year end and our leverage ratio was 5 7 times adjusted ebitda which takes into account the pro forma impact of the sale of the remaining distribution centers to wba now let s turn to our fiscal 2020 guidance similar to others in the retail pharmacy space we are facing significant pharmacy margin headwinds as the lack of new generics in the break open period and market conditions with regards to generic supply are expected to negatively impact our ability to offset reimbursement rate pressures with drug cost savings these industry headwinds will more than offset the benefits we received from the extension of our supply agreement with mckesson we expect total sales to be between 21 5 billion and 21 9 billion and same store sales to be in a range of flat to an increase of 1 we expect to have positive script comp growth through a continued focus on our clinical capabilities and prescription file buys and we ll be looking to expand into additional preferred networks in calendar 2020 at envision we expect additional commercial med d business to offset some client losses that we will be cycling during fiscal 2020 as we turn our focus to the 2020 selling season we expect adjusted ebitda to be between 500 million and 560 million in addition to the pharmacy headwinds noted above we expect to offset the loss of tsa income in fiscal 2020 with the impact of the headcount reductions that we announced last month we also expect rent expense to increase by 11 million as a result of the adoption of the new lease accounting standard we have identified further cost reduction opportunities that we will be aggressively pursuing which we expect to offset the impact of wage and benefit inflation our net loss guidance includes an estimate of 55 million for restructuring expenses related to the rightsizing of our organization that we announced last month and the initiatives that john and bryan discussed earlier on the call i expect the restructuring expense estimate to be refined in future quarters as we further develop these initiatives keep in mind that this restructuring expense is not part of adjusted ebitda or adjusted net income we expect adjusted net income to be in a range of a loss of 7 million to income of 36 million or a range of a loss of 0 01 per share to income of 0 04 per share our fiscal 2020 capital expenditure plan is to spend 250 million which includes 60 million for script file buys and investments in technology designed to accelerate our digital and omni channel offering we are planning to open or relocate eight stores and remodel 70 stores in fiscal 2020 this completes my portion of the presentation and now i ll turn it back to john john standley chief executive officer thank you matt and before we open the lines for questions i d just like to state that despite a challenging environment for pharmacy reimbursement rates we are well positioned to build on our strengths and capitalize on our best opportunities for future growth we have important momentum in key areas such as same store pharmacy sales and script count cost control in our pharmacy services segment based upon our analysis of the marketplace and a thorough understanding of our target customers needs we also have a clear strategy for our path to the future that will leverage our core competencies and unique capabilities in delivering improved patient care see us ph reimagining our front end business and drive further efficiency to fuel strategic investment and finally we also have ample liquidity and a stronger balance sheet which gives us the time and flexibility we need to execute our strategy for growth while we have some critical work ahead of us we also have full confidence in our team our strategy and our company to succeed as we build momentum for the future that concludes our prepared remarks for the call we will now open up the phone lines for your questions questions and answers operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of john heinbockel from guggenheim securities your line is open john heinbockel guggenheim securitie analyst hey john two things number one if we think about the decline in adjusted ebitda in 2020 that is entirely concentrated in the retail segment is that fair and then secondly it sounds like you still believe the retail business can grow ebitda long term what does it take what s the most important prerequisite to get there is it to have a significant improvement in reimbursement pressure is that the most important thing john standley chief executive officer well i guess to the first part of the question yeah it s the decline in adjusted ebitda is focused on the retail side of the business i m a believer in the retail business john i really do think this thing can grow over time i mean i think if you i know we re a little negative here on the comps but if you kind of look at what we ve been through the last few years i think we re still in a really great position here and we ve done a lot of work here on this business over the last several months while it s not obviously a huge impact on fiscal year 20 i think we ve built a plan here with a lot of great initiatives and activities in it that we think is going to really reinvigorate this business and move it forward and so while maybe there s a little bit upside to what we ve got in the guidance here we think there s a big impact for us in fiscal year 21 so we ve got a lot of good things kind of working behind the scenes here reimbursement rate obviously is a little bit of the limiter on our results it s going to depend on how that kind of plays out over time from where reimbursement rates were honestly two years ago to where they are today it has gotten a little bit better for us but obviously we ve seen some tightening on the generic market as well so we continue to work with payer partners to try and find solutions that work for both of us that allow them to be competitive in the marketplace but also allow us to make appropriate returns in our investments to do to deliver the services that we re delivering the other thing i would just say on the reimbursement rate side john is that we i think have a lot of core capabilities here to really drive better outcomes health outcomes in the marketplace and i think a key part of where we re going is to really leverage those capabilities that should make us a better partner a more valued partner as we go forward and so i think it all sort of fits together for us we think it all comes together in a singular way that takes us forward so we re going to fight the reimbursement rates it s going to be a challenge but there s a lot of there s enough opportunity here with improvements to the business and we think additional revenue streams that we can access that we can actually grow this business over time john heinbockel guggenheim securitie analyst and then two quick things if i think about the cost inflation on the retail side of the business right labor rent et cetera is that in the 2 2 5 range is that about right and then secondly when you think about your vision for the front end in sku optimization so i take it that is not otc hba that is more food and consumables what do you think when you think about revitalizing the front end and i still think wellness is a key part of that but is it assortment is it the value proposition has gotten stale how do you assess that john standley chief executive officer i think i would just say and i ll kick it over to bryan i think assortment is a piece of the puzzle for us we ve got to continue evolve the merchandising inside the store we made a lot of progress when we went to the wellness format but i think we have another opportunity another kind of turn of the wheel here to take the merchandising forward own brand is a huge opportunity for us there s so much more that we can do in that space as we push forward here and kind of getting the noise of the past behind us i think is opening some doors for us to gain additional access to things that really i think help us kind of push forward there and i do think there are some additional services that we can do inside the box you talked about wellness but tying that in with the wellness ambassadors and other things we can do with pharmacists those are all going to be big parts of how this kind of plays out i know bryan you want add something bryan everett chief operating officer john it s bryan to answer the first question i think that s probably a fair range although we work to offset these additional expense challenges just through operating efficiencies and technology so we feel pretty good about that just to build on john s comments we ve really identified beauty health vitamins and consumables as the four categories in the front of the store that we will continue to invest in in terms of differentiation and we will edit the assortment but it s also an introduction of cleaner products more better for you products as john mentioned a huge effort around own brand we have a lot of opportunity there and it s actually pretty exciting and then we re also looking at our marketing as we shift some of these dollars to more personalized more digital more relevant offers that we have access to through our again our loyalty program and just moving away a little bit from the mass message to a more personalized message lot of work john heinbockel guggenheim securitie analyst okay thank you operator our next question comes from the line of lisa gill from jpmorgan your line is open michael minchak jpmorgan analyst thanks it s actually michael minchak in for lisa this morning first question you guys talked about the focus on gaining access to limited networks going forward we ve seen significant traction in the part d market but what are you seeing in the commercial market has there been increased uptake of preferred in our networks there and then you also highlighted the emerging value based care marketplace so you re starting to see interest from payers or pbms around high performance networks or outcomes based reimbursements and if so is that discussions that you re having for calendar 2020 or is that sort of more of a longer term opportunity at this point john standley chief executive officer i think it s probably both in terms of the commercial marketplace it s still i d say kind of a gradual uptake in terms of narrow preferred networks there there s interest in it but it s not moving at the speed that part d has we think there s a unique opportunity for us we ve built some care models in the past we were kind of connected more at the provider level where we really drove some improved health outcomes we think there s a real opportunity for us to connect deeper at the payer level particularly in working with envisionrxoptions here there s a lot of interest that we we ve kind of been out and surveyed the market place a little bit there s a lot of interest particularly in the regional health plan space folks are really looking in terms of how they re going to compete with these bigger vertically integrated sort of healthcare models we think there s some exciting opportunities for us potentially in that space and others as we kind of dig in here with the kinds of things that we can do with the core competencies that we have so that s where we think a lot of the opportunity is there s been a lot of action over obviously in the part d space and even some in the commercial space with some of our reimbursement being tied to outcomes in terms of what we deliver on various key metrics in the pharmacy so that s kind of an ongoing trend i d say michael minchak jpmorgan analyst got it and then you ve talked about opportunities around prescription file buys can you talk about what that pipeline looks like at this point with the ongoing reimbursement pressure that you and your larger competitors have been discussing are you seeing an increase in the number of opportunities for file buys and can you talk about whether there s been any changes in terms sort of the relative historical valuations on script files matt schroeder chief financial officer yeah mike it s matt i ll jump in and tackle this one i think from the standpoint of there s always been kind of a pretty robust pipeline there s a surprising level of churn in this business when you get past kind of some of the get down into the independent level there s quite a few independence there s a lot of churn in the business and the other thing is i think you are seeing some competitors probably more on the big box and grocery level who are looking to scale back their pharmacy have looked to scale back their pharmacy offer and that s put some stuff in the pipeline as well it s competitive it s competitive on a kind of deal by deal basis it all depends on who s in the marketplace as far as valuations i think in the past we ve used a range of 10 to 20 per script and i d say that range still holds michael minchak jpmorgan analyst got it that s helpful and then if i could squeeze one more john standley chief executive officer hey mike i would just throw one more thing on to that we talk about buying files we talk about preferred networks and things i mean a big opportunity for us is really about the capacity we have in this business today i mean we have the ability to add a lot of script volume here there s a high component of fixed cost in operating our retail pharmacies so between those kinds of opportunities and again trying to build relationships with payer partners on outcomes and using that to bring more foot traffic into the stores as well we think there s a lot of value we can create here and those file buys and preferred networks have a low incremental cost to fill so we can afford to make some investments there michael minchak jpmorgan analyst got it that s helpful and if i could squeeze one more on the pbm side as we think about the hhs rebate rule on rebates at the point of sale as it relates to your pbm can you talk about the potential impact to your business if that were to go in place as proposed and if we were ultimately to see a shift away from rebates in the commercial market can you talk about how much of your profit is driven by retained rebates and sort of what the impact would be on your business going forward if rebates were to go away ben bulkley chief executive officer so right now mike this is ben we retain no rebates in our medicare medicaid lines to our commercial clients we pass all your rebates in our transparent model so the key question with the proposed ruling is one of timing given as we move into our bids coming up and having a stable set of rules our expectation is we ll be bidding off of the rules that are in place at the time and we hope to do well with that michael minchak jpmorgan analyst got it appreciate the comments operator our next question comes from the line of robert jones from goldman sachs your line is open kevin hartman goldman sachs analyst hi this is kevin on for bob this morning thanks for taking the question so first obviously reimbursement pressure seems to be having a meaningful impact on you guys and your competitors this upcoming year i was just wondering if there is any detail you can give around expectations or cadence for the retail gross margin through fiscal 20 and whether you expect we should see any improvement in margins off of the fiscal 4q levels thanks john standley chief executive officer sure i think that s a great question again i think for us when you look at just overall the cadence of reimbursement rate i think this last year and this coming year fiscal year 20 they are at reduced levels from where they were just the two years prior to that we actually saw much deeper declines and the issue for us this coming year is a little bit probably more on the purchasing side having said that we re actually not quite yet buttoned down for fiscal year 2020 we still have an open contract that we re working through so our guidance is based on the best information we have right now based on where we think rates are going to land in terms of cadence i think you re right generally the fourth quarter even into the first quarter here it takes us a little bit of time to get the generic savings through our various bids and also little bit of timing on how some loes are coming to market in the year so a little bit more pressure early and then as those savings and some of the loes kick in the back half that really pushes us along kevin hartman goldman sachs analyst awesome thanks and then one quick one on cash flow so if i look at the fiscal 20 guidance for ebitda and kind of factor out interest capex and some of the restructuring it s getting me to roughly break even for cash flow for next year so one is that like roughly correct and would you expect net working capital to be a meaningful swing factor one way or other next year john standley chief executive officer yeah first of all your math is correct you kind of walked the ebitda down to the cash interest and debt rent and capex you get to a flat cash flow i would say some of these initiatives we re focusing on could have a working capital impact and we re going to be pushing hard on those i don t want to meaningful is probably a big numbers but i think my expectation would be we d have some positive working capital benefit coming through this year kevin hartman goldman sachs analyst awesome thanks guys john standley chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from the line of william reuter from bank of america merrill lynch your line is open william reuter bank of america merrill lynch analyst good morning in your guidance you talked about reimbursement rate pressure and 20 being similar to 19 can you tell us what the reimbursement rate pressure would have been on a dollar basis in 2019 and i think there s a lot of commentary in the industry that these reimbursement rate pressures are accelerating so i guess it was a little surprising that you said it was similar so if you could comment on that as well john standley chief executive officer well i mean i think we all have different contract renewal dates and cadences we ve never i don t think it s appropriate for us to give that out because it starts to get what our actual rates are so don t think that s the right thing to do but because of the timing of renewals and we took a lot of rate declines a couple years ago when we were working through some of our merger activity so it does show up different times in different places i think i don t think we all have to be at exactly the same spot at any given moment we do still have an open contract to work through for the current year so we got to get that finalized but our comments are accurate our rate pressure is probably where it s going to be we think based on what we know so far it s going to be pretty similar for our fiscal year 20 as it was for our fiscal year 19 bryan everett chief operating officer and i think i would add is i think the commentary around the generic market between the kind of introductions that are single source and the supplier things that some of our competitors have been saying as well that s a pretty big factor on pharmacy margin for sure william reuter bank of america merrill lynch analyst that makes sense and then i don t think if i remember that you have ever quantified the new mckesson agreement in terms of the tailwind there is there anything you can provide there because i think it becomes effective in march or i guess a month ago john standley chief executive officer no it s actually is back in the fourth quarter bryan everett chief operating officer it s already effective we ve never given kind of a number it s in the guidance we don t break out all the various components of pharmacy margins william reuter bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay and then just lastly from me it would seem to me that given the transparency of envisionrx business model it would be a little better position given a lot of these i guess headlines that are coming out in the market i guess do you think that that is the case and do you think that this is going to allow you to win additional medicare part d in those 2020 negotiations for bidding ben bulkley chief executive officer yes this is ben we do we re seeing a really nice uptick in the health of our funnel we re off to a great start already this year so we re very positive on the progress we re making and clients are indicating a real hunger for this option as they consider their buying decision william reuter bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay i ll pass it to others thank you operator our next question comes from the line of ross muken from evercore your line is open suzie yoon evercore analyst hey guys this is suzie yoon on for ross i think most of my questions have been asked but you mentioned you ve initiated the search for a new ceo could you just provide us with an update on management plans and what the timeline looks like for the ceo cfo and coo hiring john standley chief executive officer well we ve got a cfo matt schroeder is here and he is our cfo so that s good news we have a coo bryan everett s here i m the guy on the bubble and i know the board is actively working on the search so did i answer that question i m not sure suzie yoon evercore analyst got you thank you john standley chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from the line of karru martinson from jefferies your line is open karru martinson jefferies analyst good morning guys in terms of tsa wind down you talked about 42 million of savings coming through this year being realized what s the cadence of those savings and what s your level of confidence on offsetting that full 96 million matt schroeder chief financial officer first of all the cadence of the savings is pretty much starting right away and going through the year i mean with the restructuring we announced last month is being in action very quickly so i would say that s pretty evenly spread through the year john standley chief executive officer i mean probably a little bit less in the first quarter and more in the back matt schroeder chief financial officer yes on the 96 million karru i think as we ve moved along here through the tsa wind down i think we ve done actually a pretty good job of not leaving stranded costs in the business for that we talked about how this 40 millions is going to almost directly offset the reduction in tsa fees that we re expecting for this year i think between the other initiatives we have out there plus kind of the rest of the run rate impact of the restructuring we ve already announced i m very confident we ll offset that 96 million karru martinson jefferies analyst okay and then in terms of the pro forma leverage here that s assuming the that 160 million ph or so comes in from walgreens as excess proceeds and those would go to the 2023 notes correct matt schroeder chief financial officer it assumes that the 160 million is a reduction in our debt i think we still have some limited excess proceeds offer we need to make on the 2023 notes i don t know if it winds up dollar for dollar but there s a little bit more we need to do there karru martinson jefferies analyst okay and then lastly you guys talked about looking at your front end and aligning it with your customer needs we ve seen some talk about looking at the card section bringing in the cbd oils and things of that nature how do you look at transforming and what parts of your business do you feel are lagging and what parts have traction with the consumer today bryan everett chief operating officer karru it s bryan i ll just kind of reiterate the overall sku optimization project to really try to identify skus that are unproductive get those out reallocate that space for more better for you cleaner products natural organic and then the own brand it s probably the one to answer the last part of the question it s probably the one where we have the most opportunity to make up ground on karru martinson jefferies analyst all right thanks very much guys operator and we have time for one more question our final question today will come from the line of bryan hunt from wells fargo securities your line is open bryan hunt wells fargo securities analyst thank you just sticking with karru s questioning have you all done any initial reset testing on the front end and what type of reactions are you getting from sales and margin improvements on those resets bryan everett chief operating officer bryan it s bryan we have experimented with a number of different we call them innovation sets both in grocery healthcare but we ve got a lot more work to do so the new wellness remodel we still believe is a very shoppable and easy to navigate experience we believe the layout in that format is still very good but when you start digging into the item selection within the departments we again think there s some opportunity to sort of edit what we have at shelf the new grocery innovation that we worked on that we talked about a little bit last quarter i think we have this in about 150 stores we re getting very good feedback from consumers about the expanded assortment of healthy offerings the easier to navigate aisles etcetera so i guess the short answer is yes we have quite a few of these different tests out there in the field and we will continue to do so john standley chief executive officer and i would just add that we re working through a process it ll go through a good part of this fiscal year that again as we think about the pharmacy side of the business and really some core customers that drive both the pharmacy and the front end and how we can better meet their needs we re also looking at what kind of disease states are we talking about we re looking a little bit more locally and regionally about how these stores should be merchandised and trying to get all those pieces of puzzle really to fit together as we go forward bryan hunt wells fargo securities analyst and when you look at all these test alerts on the pharmacy side and the additional services you may add are in the front end in terms of merchandising do you all expect to have some type of more formalized plan that can be rolled out next year or do you feel like john standley chief executive officer that s exactly right we got a ton of work going on behind the scenes here so i ve got parts out being tested and what not but it s going to come together in a more formal way for fiscal year 21 and we d be talking about it each quarter as it develops here bryan hunt wells fargo securities analyst great just a couple more questions one you look at the amazon lockers can you talk about which stores where you have amazon lockers today and maybe how the performance of those front ends may differ relative to stores that don t john standley chief executive officer bryan we have these lockers in a few stores and i would say just generally we see some traffic generated from these lockers we will be expanding this over the next few months to an additional 900 stores we re actually 900 in total so we are excited to move forward with that partnership bryan hunt wells fargo securities analyst if you look at the at the cbd opportunity i know you re rolling it out in a few states it seems like there s a lot of noise in that category in terms of product purity is there any way you can communicate to us which brand or brands you re rolling out john standley chief executive officer what i can say bryan is we have two vendors that we have been working with for several months actually and like any product we put in the store there s a pretty rigorous vetting process to make sure we have the best offering available the other comment i would make is at this point in time we are only offering the topical solutions of creams lip balms lotions we won t be carrying any of the injectables at any of our stores as part of the pilot bryan hunt wells fargo securities analyst and then my last question there s a measles scare in various parts of the country you have stores in those areas are those vaccinations that you all could provide and are you seeing any difference in performance i guess in certain parts of the country given the various scares on measles and maybe other viruses currently thank you that s it i appreciate your time john standley chief executive officer okay it s a short answer the answer is yes we do provide these vaccinations and yes we are seeing an increase in the administration of these immunizations and we have supply to do so bryan hunt wells fargo securities analyst well thank you for your time and best of luck john standley chief executive officer thank you bryan operator and we have no further questions john standley chief executive officer okay great we appreciate everybody s time today and look forward to talking to you in the future operator thanks to all of our

berlin reuters german finance minister olaf scholz has said financial leaders must use talks in washington this week to avoid any escalation in trade disputes as political risks pose the biggest threat to a slowing world economy u s president donald trump s threat this week to impose tariffs on 11 billion worth of european union products including commercial aircraft has opened a new front in his global trade war and deepened a long running transatlantic subsidy dispute surrounding boeing and airbus all parties must do their part to avoid an escalation of trade disputes scholz told reuters in an interview on wednesday ahead of the april 12 14 international monetary fund and world bank spring meetings scholz also vice chancellor in chancellor angela merkel s governing coalition said the global economy was losing steam but there was still growth in europe and germany and that political problems such as the u s trade disputes and brexit could be solved that s why the talks in washington are so important scholz said he also said the eu should help britain reach an agreement for an orderly departure from the bloc everyone in europe hopes that there will be an agreement between the government and opposition about the way to get an agreed brexit scholz said it s the task of the european union to be helpful in a process in the united kingdom like this scholz said i hope that the risk of a no deal brexit is decreasing german chancellor angela merkel had said she wanted eu leaders meeting later on wednesday to grant britain a delay in its divorce from the bloc but also to make sure that once agreement on the divorce was reached in london brexit could take place quickly fair taxation scholz also wants to use the talks in washington to achieve progress for a minimum level of corporate taxation globally for me a very important topic for the imf meeting is the fight for fair taxation scholz said we want to prevent large global corporations escaping their responsibility to pay taxes financial leaders will discuss proposals to introduce a minimum level of corporate taxation the ambitious goal is to reach an international agreement by the summer of next year scholz said the german finance minister said he did not expect the meetings in washington to discuss foreign exchange rate manipulation or germany s large current account surplus however scholz said germany would use parts of its budget surplus to boost fiscal stimulus and support corporate research and development with incentives worth 1 25 billion euros 1 41 billion annually without a time limit on euro zone reform scholz said he was very optimistic that finance ministers would agree on the structure of a new euro zone budget by summer asked about any political support or influence in merger talks between deutsche bank and commerzbank scholz played down the government s role this is a corporate decision that must be worked out by the two banks scholz said reporting by michael nienaber editing by madeline chambers by michael nienaber and christian kraemer
the international monetary fund has pointed to a slowdown in growth for 70 percent of the world economy by value in 2019 with the most significant weakening taking place in the advanced economies any recovery in 2020 is dependent on expanded production in emerging market economies the forecast was contained in the imf s world economic outlook report issued on tuesday for its spring meeting in washington this week the weo cut the forecast for global growth for 2019 by 0 2 percentage points from its prediction in january and said global growth would fall to 3 3 percent this year from 3 6 percent in 2018 commenting on the report imf chief economist gita gopinath said the downward revision reflected negative revisions for several major economies including the euro area latin america the united states the united kingdom canada and australia measures of industrial production and investment remain weak in many advanced and emerging market economies and global trade has yet to recover the imf has forecast a return to 3 6 percent global growth in 2020 but this is based on shaky foundations according to gopinath the recovery is precarious and is predicated on a rebound in emerging market and developing economies specifically she wrote it relies on an expected rebound in growth in argentina and turkey and some improvement in a set of stressed developing countries and is therefore subject to considerable uncertainty growth in the advanced economies would continue to slow despite a partial recovery in the euro area the fact that the prospect for recovery is dependent on turkey and argentina both of which have experienced major falls in value of their currencies speaks volumes about the state of the world economy while the imf says the global economy is continuing to grow at a reasonable rate and recession is not in its projections there are many downside risks as gopinath noted a deterioration in market sentiment could rapidly tighten financing conditions in an environment of large private and public sector debt in many countries including sovereign bank doom loop risks such risks arise when the debt problems of major financial institutions impact on the stability of the banking system of the country in which those institutions are based and leads to a negative feedback loop this risk is not confined to emerging markets with italy one of the g7 group of major economies a possible candidate the imf has described the situation as a delicate moment for the global economy if downside risks do not materialise and policy support is effective then global growth should rebound gopinath wrote if however any of the major risks materialise then the expected recoveries in stressed economies export dependent economies and highly indebted economies may be derailed the worsening situation in the advanced economies was highlighted in a comment by financial times economist gavin davies on monday while holding out the possibility for a recovery he noted that no one in policy circles believes that a return to the strong global expansion seen in 2017 is very likely davies pointed to three main factors in the continuing weakness in global manufacturing and merchandise trade the growth in business capital expenditure in the global economy was now effectively down to zero after reaching 6 percent in 2017 the escalation of trade tensions between the us and china and the us and europe had disrupted global supply chains and there had been a cyclical downturn in it production in emerging asia which had yet to reach bottom among the reasons for the slowdown the imf s weo report pointed to trade tensions that increasingly took a toll on business confidence it warned that a further escalation and the associated increases in policy uncertainty could further weaken growth setting out policy priorities the report said the main issue at the multilateral level is for countries to resolve trade disagreements cooperatively without raising distortionary barriers that would further destabilise a slowing global economy however events are moving in the opposite direction despite reports about what the imf called a more optimistic outlook for a settlement of the us china trade conflict the two sides have yet to reach an agreement the us is insisting that there are still major issues to be resolved including on intellectual property rights and an enforcement mechanism for any agreement the trump administration has also chosen to increase tensions with europe by moving to act on a world trade organisation report that the european aircraft manufacturer airbus had received subsidies that benefited it as against its us rival boeing the finding was brought down in last may and airbus maintains that it has taken action to comply on tuesday however trump launched a new trade offensive declaring in a tweet the world trade organisation finds that the european union subsidies to airbus had adversely impacted the united states which will now put tariffs on 11 billion of eu products the eu has taken advantage of the us on trade for many years it will soon stop the list of possible tariffs covers a range of goods from aeroplanes and helicopters to agricultural products such as wine and cheese us representative robert lighthizer said the case had been in litigation for 14 years and the time has come for action on the other side the eu is also preparing its own measures against the us for the failure by washington to end tax breaks for boeing that harm airbus the announcement of the new tariff threat came as boeing faces a deepening crisis over two crashes of its 737 max 8 plane resulting in the deaths of 346 people due to faulty software in its automatic pilot system this again underscores the direct ties between the us government and the aerospace giant the new tariff threat against europe is also related to the negotiations between the us and the eu over a trade deal last july under the threat of having a 25

with it former us trade negotiator wendy cutler told the news agency that trump had been able to use the threat of tariffs to force the eu japan and others into negotiations but pointed to the

bryden teich portfolio manager at avenue investment management focus north american equities market outlook interest rates have moved down significantly so far in 2019 a slower economic growth backdrop has pushed central banks to the sidelines around the world notably the fed ecb and bank of canada this has been a major contributor to the higher stock markets we ve seen thus far in 2019 the economic data so far this year has been soft in the u s and canada but not terrible our focus from a macro perspective is on looking out for the duration of this year and trying to determine if the economic backdrop is conducive to decent growth in 2019 and 2020 the jobs market seems to be resilient and the leading economic indicators are also still in positive territory key metrics to focus on are consumer and business confidence although they ve recently pulled back from near all time high levels they re still showing positive readings that would be conducive to a moderately expanding economy if the economy continues to expand moderately then i think we re looking at an environment where the stock market could move higher on late cycle multiple expansion this is something that we re watching for very closely positive momentum on us china trade talks and also brexit would help market sentiment through the balance of the year on the other hand retail sales have been weak in the u s and industrial production has been soft as well the jobs data each month becomes more and more important as an indicator to see if the economy is still expanding the biggest red flag is that the u s is also increasing their national debt at close to 7 per cent of gdp this year which is absolutely crazy and running an official deficit of somewhere between 4 and 5 per cent of gdp an unprecedented level given we re so late in the economic cycle this isn t sustainable over the longer term in the next fed cutting cycle there s a strong chance we see a much weaker u s dollar because the central bank will have to embark on a large scale quantitative easing program that includes outright debt monetization although the u s dollar remains strong the current situation makes us more cautious on the outlook over the next few years the yield curve is also beginning to flash a yellow sign which doesn t bode well for the medium term economic growth outlook investors should be watching closely the spread between overnight interest rates and the five and 10 year rates the interest rates market is pricing in the next move in rates as a cut by the boc and the fed this is something to watch for over the past six months we have continued our focus on adding quality and yield to our equity portfolio we want to be positioned for the market to move higher on any late cycle multiple expansion but in a way that protects our portfolio in a downside scenario we re weighted at roughly 23 per cent in high yield bonds mics and cash which gives us our insurance policy against market volatility top picks bryden teich s top picks bryden teich portfolio manager at avenue investment management shares his top picks superior plus vermilion energy and onex superior plus spb to superior is an energy and chemicals distributor that has a core part of their business in propane distribution throughout the u s northeast they have executed on a number of acquisitions over the last few years which has helped the company expand their geographical footprint and also continue to add more retail customers which provide for higher margins than their wholesale distribution segments because of the colder winter in the region they ve maintained company guidance at the high end of their expectations for 2019 the shares currently yield 6 25 per cent and have a payout ratio of less than 50 per cent we think the shares are trading at an attractive multiple and there is ample room for the company to continue to add tuck in acquisitions throughout the year vermilion energy vet to vermilion is a diversified energy producer that has assets in saskatchewan europe and parts of the u s they are one of the few canadian producers who have exposure to brent and european natural gas pricing which has
