relation to 2018 fourth quarter and year end results kinross once again delivered on its commitments in 2018 as we met our production cost and capital guidance for the seventh consecutive year our portfolio of mines produced solid results with standout performances from paracatu and bald mountain both of which delivered record annual production following successful completion of the tasiast phase one expansion the mine achieved record production in the fourth quarter with throughput and recoveries exceeding expectations kinross also generated approximately 790 million in operating cash flow and maintained its strong balance sheet with 1 9 billion in liquidity and no debt maturities until 2021 we expect to deliver another strong year in 2019 producing approximately 2 5 million gold equivalent ounces at costs similar to 2018 our development projects are proceeding well and we look forward to a number of milestones this year including the start of commissioning of the bald mountain vantage complex processing circuit and completion of the lobo marte scoping study in the first quarter the start of commissioning of the round mountain phase w processing circuit in the second quarter and the completion of the la coipa restart feasibility study and the start of stripping at fort knox gilmore in the third quarter at tasiast we continue to evaluate alternative approaches to further increase throughput and reduce capital while preserving the overall value of the project the project financing is progressing well and we are targeting completion mid year 2018

compared with net earnings of 445 4 million or 0 36 per share for full year 2017 this change was primarily a result of decreased operating earnings a reversal of impairment charges related to the cerro casale sale in 2017 and an increase in 2018 income tax expense capital expenditures capital expenditures decreased to 273 0 million for q4 2018 compared with 313 3 million for the same period last year capital expenditures for full year 2018 were 1 043 4 million compared with 897 6 million for 2017 primarily due to increased spending at round mountain bald mountain and tasiast partially offset by lower spending at paracatu and chirano capital expenditures were at the low end of the company s guidance balance sheet as of december 31 2018 kinross had cash and cash equivalents of 349 0 million compared with 1 025 8 million at december 31 2017 the decrease was primarily due to capital expenditures at the company s development projects and the acquisition of two hydroelectric power plants in brazil partially offset by net operating cash inflows the company has available credit of 1 552 9 million as of year end 2018 for total liquidity of 1 901 9 million and no scheduled debt repayments until 2021 operating results mine by mine summaries for 2018 fourth quarter and full year operating results may be found on pages 22 and 26 of this news release highlights include the following americas the americas region which represented 61 of kinross 2018 production delivered strong results during the year paracatu and bald mountain achieved record annual production while round mountain continued to perform well paracatu performed strongly in 2018 with production increasing 45 compared with full year 2017 the record annual production was mainly as a result of record recoveries in plant 2 and significant increases in tonnes of ore mined and processed production in q4 2018 was higher compared with the previous quarter mainly due to an increase in grades and higher recoveries cost of sales per ounce in 2018 was lower compared with 2017 primarily as a result of lower power costs due to the acquisition of the power plants in the third quarter and favourable foreign exchange movements higher grades also contributed to the lower cost of sales per ounce in q4 2018 versus the previous quarter at round mountain 2018 production met expectations but was lower compared with 2017 primarily due to fewer ounces recovered from the heap leach pads partially offset by the timing of ounces processed through the mill production in q4 2018 was largely consistent compared with the previous quarter full year cost of sales per ounce was higher year over year mainly due to lower heap leach grades and higher fuel and power costs cost of sales per ounce increased in q4 2018 compared with the previous quarter mainly due to higher processing costs bald mountain continued to perform well achieving record full year production in 2018 production in q4 2018 was lower compared with q3 2018 mainly as a result of timing of recoveries from the heap leach pads cost of sales per ounce for 2018 was lower than full year 2017 mainly as a result of less operating waste mined and the timing of gold equivalent ounces sold cost of sales per ounce in q4 2018 increased compared with the previous quarter mainly due to fewer ounces recovered from the heap leach pads fort knox full year production decreased year over year largely due to a decrease in grades and tonnes of ore processed in the mill and placed on the heap leach pads the pit wall failure in q1 2018 also limited access to higher grade ore and higher than average rainfall in the second half of 2018 affected geotechnical stability production in the fourth quarter was largely consistent with the third quarter of 2018 full year cost of sales per ounce was higher compared with 2017 mainly due to a decline in grades and an increase in operating waste mined cost of sales per ounce in q4 2018 was lower versus q3 2018 mainly due to lower processing costs maricunga delivered strong results during the year as production from the rinsing of heap materials placed on the pads prior to the suspension of mining activities was better than expected cost of sales per ounce for full year 2018 was higher than 2017 mainly due to timing of sales russia the region continued its strong and consistent performance as kupol and dvoinoye s combined full year production met expectations while cost of sales per ounce outperformed full year production was lower than the previous year mainly due to the expected decrease in grades and the completion of mining of the september northeast deposit at the end of 2017 production quarter over quarter was largely consistent full year cost of sales per ounce was slightly higher versus 2017 mainly due to lower grades at dvoinoye and increased maintenance costs q4 2018 cost of sales per ounce was lower quarter over quarter mainly due to less operating waste mined and lower labour costs at dvoinoye at the dvoinoye zone 1 deposit development is continuing as scheduled and production is expected to commence in mid 2019 west africa full year production at tasiast was slightly higher compared with 2017 mainly due to the completion of the phase one expansion in the third quarter the site achieved record quarterly production in q4 2018 mainly due to higher than expected throughput at the new mill and better mill grades and recoveries cost of sales per ounce for the full year was higher compared with 2017 mainly due to higher fuel and maintenance costs and an increase in operating waste mined cost of sales per ounce was lower in q4 2018 compared with q3 2018 mainly due to higher mill grades and lower operating waste mined production at chirano was slightly lower for the full year compared with 2017 mainly due to anticipated lower grades and was lower quarter over quarter primarily as a result of lower mill throughput cost of sales per ounce for full year 2018 decreased compared with 2017 mainly due to lower overhead maintenance and power costs as open pit mining was suspended in q3 2017 cost of sales per ounce was higher in q4 2018 versus q3 2018 mainly due to lower mill throughput partially offset by lower power costs and favourable foreign exchange movements organic development projects tasiast expansion update tasiast continues to perform strongly achieving record quarterly production in q4 2018 the site is currently exceeding throughput and recovery expectations the phase one expansion has been completed successfully and the new sag mill is performing very well in addition continuous improvement initiatives have been undertaken which are expected to result in meaningful cost and operational improvements the company expects tasiast to continue to deliver strong operational performance in 2019 the phase two expansion continues to be a viable option as the company completes its evaluation of alternative approaches to further increase throughput at tasiast the evaluation is seeking ways to reduce capital expenditures while preserving the overall value proposition and incorporates strong phase one performance results including throughput averaging above nameplate capacity phase two expansion considerations include among other matters results from the company s evaluation of alternative throughput approaches acceptable project financing terms capital priorities across the company s portfolio and the ongoing discussions with the government of mauritania these discussions with the government have focused on matters that arise occasionally and are generally common to the mining sector these matters include tax issues expatriate work permits and increasing opportunities for local suppliers in accordance with kinross policy and applicable laws in addition the parties have engaged in an ongoing dialogue regarding the company s exemption from importation duties on fuel under the tasiast mining convention further the company continues to seek from the government an exploitation license for tasiast sud the government has not expressed an intention to re open the tasiast mining convention and in any event kinross remains protected by its rights under the mining convention which includes international arbitration provisions the existing tasiast operation is also covered under the company s political risk insurance policy with the multilateral investment guarantee agency miga a member of the world bank group kinross continues to advance discussions to obtain the approximately 300 million in project financing for tasiast in addition to the previously signed mandate letters with export development canada edc and the international finance corporation ifc which indicated their interest in the financing subject to completing due diligence two commercial banks have also expressed interest in the financing and are now engaged in the due diligence process the financing is progressing and completion is targeted for mid 2019 round mountain phase w the round mountain phase w project continues to progress on schedule and on budget with pre stripping advancing well initial low grade phase w ore has been encountered and is being placed on the existing heap leach pads construction of the new heap leach pad is now approximately 80 complete while construction of the vertical carbon in column vcic plant is approximately 50 complete with commissioning for both expected to start in q2 2019 construction of mine infrastructure such as the truck shop warehouse wash bay and fuel island are all proceeding as planned and are approximately 35 complete fort knox gilmore project the fort knox gilmore project is progressing well on schedule and on budget with initial ore expected in early 2020 construction of the heap leach has begun and will continue during the 2019 and 2020 construction seasons expansion of the dewatering system will continue throughout the year in anticipation of stripping that is expected to commence in q3 2019 bald mountain vantage complex the bald mountain vantage complex project is proceeding well with construction of the heap leach approximately 85 complete and the vcic approximately 30 complete some challenges due to weather and a tight labour market have been encountered but commissioning of the heap leach and processing facilities remain on track to begin in late q1 2019 support infrastructure including the truck shop warehouse and wash bay is approximately 25 complete stacking of economic but previously leached ore on the new heap leach pad is underway with approximately 50 of the material moved onto a segregated portion mining activities at the vantage complex have commenced and initial ore is now being mined and stockpiled in preparation for placement on the new heap chile projects the feasibility study for the la coipa restart project and the scoping study for the lobo marte project are both proceeding well and are expected to conclude in the third quarter of 2019 and first quarter of 2019 respectively permitting is in place for the la coipa restart project and permitting strategy planning has begun at lobo marte outlook the following section of the news release represents forward looking information and users are cautioned that actual results may vary we refer to the risks and assumptions contained in the cautionary statement on forward looking information on page 37 of this news release in 2019 kinross expects to produce 2 5 million au eq oz 5 from its operations in line with 2018 production production is expected to be lower in the first quarter of 2019 compared with the rest of the year mainly as a result of the expected bald mountain vantage complex project ramp up and lower production from fort knox as per the operation s mining and milling strategy production cost of sales is expected to be 730 per au eq oz 5 for 2019 which is in line with full year 2018 cost of sales the company expects all in sustaining cost to be 995 5 per ounce sold on both a gold equivalent and by product basis for 2019 which is largely in line with full year

at kupol depth extension at the central zone the northeast extension and at the kupol hanging wall target areas see appendix a figure 1 during the early part of the year a review of the 2017 interpreted mineralized wireframes identified a potential down plunge extension where the premolar fault separates the northern end of the north upper domain from the southern end of the north extension domain follow up drilling resulted in the confirmation of mineralization within the down plunged zone the company will continue to focus on infill and depth extension in 2019 see appendix a figure 2 the kupol deeps an area stretching from big bend to the southern limit of north upper see appendix a figure 3 drilling encountered a series of good intercepts that generated most of the inferred resource additions at kupol mineralization though narrow is open at depth for which the company will continue to drill test in 2019 the northeast deeps is the direct extension of the kupol main vein outside the kupol mining lease drilling in 2018 intersected narrow quartz carbonate veinlets and breccia fill on the main structure with some high grades results from 2018 drilling indicate that the hanging wall can be traced along the length of the kupol main vein however drilling was widely spaced along the strike and it was challenging to trace the narrow but high grade veins over appreciable strike length the company plans to drill from the underground through current kupol workings to better target the high grade veins in 2019 during the latter part of 2018 drilling provided critical stratigraphic information which resulted in a new interpretation of the entire kupol far hanging wall east wedge vein now seen to consist of a 0 5 km trend directly east of kupol some of the holes confirmed northward continuation of the favourable moroshka andesite with altered zones around narrow low grade quartz veins at this stage this interpretation is mostly based on a few holes that

of non gaap financial measures the company has included certain non gaap financial measures in this document these measures are not defined under ifrs and should not be considered in isolation the company believes that these measures together with measures determined in accordance with ifrs provide investors with an improved ability to evaluate the underlying performance of the company the inclusion of these measures is meant to provide additional information and should not be used as a substitute for performance measures prepared in accordance with ifrs these measures are not necessarily standard and therefore may not be comparable to other issuers adjusted net earnings attributable to common shareholders and adjusted net earnings per share are non gaap measures which determine the performance of the company excluding certain impacts which the company believes are not reflective of the company s underlying performance for the reporting period such as the impact of foreign exchange gains and losses reassessment of prior year taxes and or taxes otherwise not related to the current period impairment charges reversals gains and losses and other one time costs related to acquisitions dispositions and other transactions and non hedge derivative gains and losses although some of the items are recurring the company believes that they are not reflective of the underlying operating performance of its current business and are not necessarily indicative of future operating results management believes that these measures which are used internally to assess performance and in planning and forecasting future operating results provide investors with the ability to better evaluate underlying performance particularly since the excluded items are typically not included in public guidance however adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share measures are not necessarily indicative of net earnings and earnings per share measures as determined

adjusted operating cash flow adjusted operating cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations excluding certain impacts which the company believes are not reflective of the company s regular operating cash flow and excluding changes in working capital working capital can be volatile due to numerous factors including the timing of tax payments and in the case of kupol a build up of inventory due to transportation logistics the company uses adjusted operating cash flow internally as a measure of the underlying operating cash flow performance and future operating cash flow

cost of sales per ounce sold on a by product basis is a non gaap measure which calculates the company s non gold production as a credit against its per ounce production costs rather than converting its non gold production into gold equivalent ounces and crediting it to total production as is the case in co product accounting management believes that this measure provides investors with the ability to better evaluate kinross production cost of sales per ounce on a comparable basis with other major gold producers who routinely calculate their cost of sales per ounce using by product

733 637 723 653 in june 2013 the world gold council wgc published its guidelines for reporting all in sustaining costs and all in costs the wgc is a market development organization for the gold industry and is an association whose membership comprises leading gold mining companies including kinross although the wgc is not a mining industry regulatory organization it worked closely with its member companies to develop these non gaap measures adoption of the all in sustaining cost and all in cost metrics is voluntary and not necessarily standard and therefore these measures presented by the company may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers the company believes that the all in sustaining cost and all in cost measures complement existing measures reported by kinross all in sustaining cost includes both operating and capital costs required to sustain gold production on an ongoing basis the value of silver sold is deducted from the total production cost of sales as it is considered residual production sustaining operating costs represent expenditures incurred at current operations that are considered necessary to maintain current production sustaining capital represents capital expenditures at existing operations comprising mine development costs and ongoing replacement of mine equipment and other capital facilities and does not include capital expenditures for major growth projects or enhancement capital for significant infrastructure improvements at existing operations all in cost is comprised of all in sustaining cost as well as operating

interview by peter brimelow milton friedman soothsayer boom bust inflation deflation milton friedman peers into the future making predictions on price levels in the united states stagnation in japan and the new currency in europe a freewheeling discussion with peter brimelow brimelow deflation talk is fashionable friedman i think the chances of a 1930s style deflation are trivial you can only have that kind of deflation if you have a bad monetary policy deflation is the easiest thing in the world to avoid you just print more money brimelow you re not worried about involuntary deflation through collapsing financial institutions friedman oh you can have recessions you can have economic crises and financial institutions failing but that will not produce deflation in the sense of falling prices as in the thirties in 1953 i gave a talk in stockholm under the title of why the american economy is depression proof i ve been right for forty five years why should i change my story now and the reason i said it then is the same reason i say it now the great depression need not have occurred if the monetary authorities had behaved differently brimelow but price levels fell through the last part of the nineteenth century friedman you can have mild deflation but it needn t be depression from 1879 to 1896 prices in the united states fell by an average of 3 percent a year from 1896 to 1914 they rose by an average of 3 percent a year the economic rate of growth was identical in the two periods so it s pretty clear that deflation doesn t mean depression brimelow okay you can have mild deflation without depression and even mild deflation does mean different investment strategies it means lower interest rates and higher bond prices my editor at forbes has us on the line saying u s bonds are a good buy in 1953 i gave a talk under the title of why the american economy is depression proof i ve been right for forty five years why should i change my story now friedman oh well at the moment i feel that they re probably a pretty good buy but not for the long term at the moment we have a rate of inflation of about 2 to 2 1 2 percent maybe 1 to 1 1 2 percent allowing for overstatement because there s no doubt official statistics overstate the rate of inflation they re not properly allowing for qualitative improvements we ve had very good monetary policy ever since alan greenspan has been chairman the best of any period since the federal reserve was established in 1913 but greenspan is not going to stay chairman forever we re getting euphoria about how inflation is dead yes the pipeline is set for the next year or two we re not going to have significant inflation in the next year or two but longer term inflation is headed up and not down money supply has been going up at 3 or 4 percent a year recently at about 7 percent and that was already showing up in wages now i think developments in east asia will slow things but i would not be prepared to say that for the next ten years the consensus estimates of 2 to 2 1 2 percent inflation will work out sometime within the next ten to twelve years we ll have a period of much higher inflation brimelow you re absolutely confident that we re not going to see a secular decline in prices for a long period of time we can t go back to the situation that obtained in the late nineteenth century friedman we could but i don t think we will because of political opposition given that we know how to prevent it and given our past history particularly the great depression now if there s any country in which the deflation scenario is possible it s japan right now brimelow do you see that spilling over friedman of course but it s not a major spillover and i don t think it ll happen in japan i don t understand the way in which the japanese central bank has been working it should be printing more money and sooner or later it seems to me it s going to do so you see the problem is that central bankers are hipped on the idea that they should worry about interest rates japa nese central bankers say we ve done all we could look how low interest rates are but they have another alternative they don t have to care about interest rates they can just go and buy up government securities if they drive the interest rate to zero what difference does it make the effect would be to put more money in circulation and to offset this extraordinary situation in which they had a speculative bubble they broke it by cutting money supply and they ve been suffering ever since because they can t get any upward momentum brimelow is that what will spark the next u s recession a trading partner s troubles friedman no i believe the next problem in the united states will be an inflationary surge in the money supply what always happens under those circumstances is that when the fed starts raising the interest rate it tends to overdo it the market will overreact and that s where you re going to get your recession brimelow what do you think about the stock market friedman well i think the stock market is overvalued but it s not setting up for a major crash brimelow when we last spoke you predicted that the european monetary union would collapse and it did britain and italy came out friedman yes it collapsed i ve also been predicting that the euro would never happen i m still not sure i m wrong the costs have been enormous to preserve the link between the franc and the deutsche mark the french had to adopt tight monetary and fiscal policy they got double digit unemployment and recession britain and italy floated and have prospered brimelow why are the europeans doing this friedman for strictly noble political purposes mitterrand and kohl believed that they were the last leaders of their countries to experience world war ii they were determined to set up a system in which world war ii could not happen again and they were willing to pay an enormous economic price i ve been predicting the euro would never happen i m still not sure i m wrong brimelow what do you think will happen now friedman i m baffled i really don t know jerry jordan of the cleveland has made a very good point suppose the euro is in existence with a central bank overseeing it what assets is it going to deal with if the u s central bank wants to increase the money supply it buys u s government bonds if it wants to decrease the money supply it sells u s bonds on the balance sheet of the european central bank to begin with the assets will be francs and deutsche marks and so on but if it wants to increase money supply what does it buy german bonds italian bonds french bonds brimelow because to the extent that it does anything it s going to affect the economy of the various countries differently friedman exactly if you had first a political unification of europe and the separate national bonds were converted into a european union issue it d be no problem or if the european bank was going to start out by deflating it could sell its own securities and then it would have something to deal with but over time it s going to be expanding the money to keep prices stable with output growing it has to increase the money flow all right how it makes a big difference to the french or the italians or the germans whose bonds are used they re going at political unification backward i am still not willing to bet my life that the euro will come into existence i think there s still a substantial chance that between now and then the whole thing will break down brimelow but the will of europe s political elite to do this is phenomenal friedman phenomenal the people are opposed to it and who is being stupid in all of this in my opinion is the business community in europe it s not going to benefit from the euro it s going to be harmed by it brimelow why friedman because the euro will lead to a less prosperous europe for example spain is hit by something it can t adjust by having its exchange rate fall it s going to adjust by rules by regulations by more control brimelow will the euro be an inflationary or deflationary factor in the world economy friedman neither inflationary nor deflationary if there are floating exchange rates and most exchange rates float but who knows what s going to happen if they go to the euro there could be a real donnybrook in europe brimelow enough to impact the world friedman oh yes i don t think the nation state is dead all attempts to depart from the nation state have so far been complete disasters brimelow isn t there increasing central bank intervention in exchange rates more dirty floats friedman oh there ve always been dirty floats the only ones that are not dirty floats are hong kong at the moment argentina maybe lithuania estonia the thais had pegged the baht against the u s dollar when the dollar appreciated that was a real problem for them but every pegged exchange rate system tends to go the same way if there is central bank intervention it gets out of alignment brimelow where does the wall street journal s editorial page campaign for fixed exchange rates fit into this friedman you got me i think that s just an aberration my god how the hell can they stick with that they ve just got an idée fixe about it like they ve got on immigration it s just obvious that you can t have free immigration and a welfare state the debate about floating exchange rates has been won by the floaters other than mundell who is a nonfloater among major american economists brimelow bartley says he thinks the nation state is dead that we re moving to a world driven by markets free movement of labor and capital i m not sure what he thinks the political institutions will be your view friedman no i don t think the nation state is dead and all attempts to depart from the nation state in the direction of the united nations and a united states of europe have so far been complete disasters it s kind of hard i think to get the american public to go that direction very far they re not very happy with the united nations there are beginning to be some rumbles about opposition to the imf brimelow a lot of opposition to nafta came from fear of loss of sovereignty friedman i thought nafta was a terrible treaty except that it was better than nothing i d rather have unilateral free trade in the united states other examples are the imf and the world bank we would never do with our own money what the imf and the world bank have done look what s happening now with iraq the united states wants to hide behind the united nations our iraq policy has been stupid from the beginning we ought to declare defeat give up say we re not going to be a policeman for the europeans call it isolationist if you will but i don t see any other way out brimelow talking of isolationism congress recently refused to renew fast track on the political right there s clearly increasing interest in protectionism for example voiced by pat buchanan are you concerned friedman buchanan s not a fool but on economics he s terrible well historically the american right has always been protectionist mckinley the 1896 election i don t think it s much of an economic threat given the size of the united states the amount of internal trade and the ability to get around protectionism via the internet via various other means i don t think protectionism is a real threat brimelow see you in 2002 friedman the odds are against it but i ll be delighted reprinted from forbes december 29 1997 forbes inc 1997 used with permission available from the hoover press

discussion of equinix s results and future outlook along with certain supplemental financial information and other data interested parties may access this information through the equinix investor relations website at www equinix com investors additional resources about equinix equinix inc nasdaq eqix connects the world s leading businesses to their customers employees and partners inside the most interconnected data centers in 52 markets across five continents equinix is where companies come together to realize new opportunities and accelerate their business it and cloud strategies non gaap financial measures equinix provides all information required in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap but it believes that evaluating its ongoing operating results may be difficult if limited to reviewing only gaap financial measures accordingly equinix uses non gaap financial measures to evaluate its operations equinix provides normalized and constant currency growth rates which are calculated to adjust for acquisitions dispositions integration costs changes in accounting principles and foreign currency equinix presents adjusted ebitda which is a non gaap financial measure adjusted ebitda represents income or loss from operations excluding depreciation amortization accretion stock based compensation expense restructuring charges impairment charges acquisition costs and gain or loss on asset sales in presenting non gaap financial measures such as adjusted ebitda cash cost of revenues cash gross margins cash operating expenses also known as cash selling general and administrative expenses or cash sg a adjusted ebitda margins free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow equinix excludes certain items that it believes are not good indicators of equinix s current or future operating performance these items are depreciation amortization accretion of asset retirement obligations and accrued restructuring charges stock based compensation restructuring charges impairment charges acquisition costs and gain or loss on asset sales equinix excludes these items in order for its lenders investors and the industry analysts who review and report on equinix to better evaluate equinix s operating performance and cash spending levels relative to its industry sector and competitors equinix excludes depreciation expense as these charges primarily relate to the initial construction costs of an ibx data center and do not reflect its current or future cash spending levels to support its business its ibx data centers are long lived assets and have an economic life greater than 10 years the construction costs of an ibx data center do not recur with respect to such data center although equinix may incur initial construction costs in future periods with respect to additional ibx data centers and future capital expenditures remain minor relative to the initial investment this is a trend it expects to continue in addition depreciation is also based on the estimated useful lives of the ibx data centers these estimates could vary from actual performance of the asset are based on historic costs incurred to build out our ibx data centers and are not indicative of current or expected future capital expenditures therefore equinix excludes depreciation from its operating results when evaluating its operations in addition in presenting the non gaap financial measures equinix also excludes amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets amortization expense is significantly affected by the timing and magnitude of acquisitions and these charges may vary in amount from period to period we exclude amortization expense to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our prior periods equinix excludes accretion expense both as it relates to its asset retirement obligations as well as its accrued restructuring charges as these expenses represent costs which equinix also believes are not meaningful in evaluating equinix s current operations equinix excludes stock based compensation expense as it can vary significantly from period to period based on share price and the timing size and nature of equity awards as such equinix and many investors and analysts exclude stock based compensation expense to compare its operating results with those of other companies equinix excludes restructuring charges from its non gaap financial measures the restructuring charges relate to equinix s decision to exit leases for excess space adjacent to several of its ibx data centers which it did not intend to build out or its decision to reverse such restructuring charges equinix also excludes impairment charges related to certain long lived assets the impairment charges are related to expense recognized whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets are not recoverable equinix also excludes gain or loss on asset sales as it represents profit or loss that is not meaningful in evaluating the current or future operating performance finally equinix excludes acquisition costs from its non gaap financial measures to allow more comparable comparisons of the financial results to the historical operations the acquisition costs relate to costs equinix incurs in connection with business combinations such charges generally are not relevant to assessing the long term performance of equinix in addition the frequency and amount of such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the acquisitions management believes items such as restructuring charges impairment charges acquisition costs and gain or loss on asset sales are non core transactions however these types of costs may occur in future periods equinix also presents funds from operations ffo and adjusted funds from operations affo which are non gaap financial measures commonly used in the reit industry ffo is calculated in accordance with the definition established by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit ffo represents net income or loss excluding gain or loss from the disposition of real estate assets depreciation and amortization on real estate assets and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures and non controlling interests share of these items affo represents ffo excluding depreciation and amortization expense on non real estate assets accretion stock based compensation restructuring charges impairment charges acquisition costs an installation revenue adjustment a straight line rent expense adjustment a contract cost adjustment amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums gain or loss on debt extinguishment an income tax expense adjustment recurring capital expenditures net income or loss from discontinued operations net of tax and adjustments from ffo to affo for unconsolidated joint ventures and non controlling interests share of these items equinix excludes depreciation expense amortization expense accretion stock based compensation restructuring charges impairment charges and acquisition costs for the same reasons that they are excluded from the other non gaap financial measures mentioned above equinix includes an adjustment for revenues from installation fees since installation fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the period of contract term although the fees are generally paid in a lump sum upon installation equinix includes an adjustment for straight line rent expense on its operating leases since the total minimum lease payments are recognized ratably over the lease term although the lease payments generally increase over the lease term equinix also includes an adjustment to contract costs incurred to obtain contracts since contract costs are capitalized and amortized over the estimated period of benefit on a straight line basis although costs of obtaining contracts are generally incurred and paid during the period of obtaining the contracts the adjustments for installation revenues straight line rent expense and contract costs are intended to isolate the cash activity included within the straight lined or amortized results in the consolidated statement of operations equinix excludes the amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums as these expenses relate to the initial costs incurred in connection with its debt financings that have no current or future cash obligations equinix excludes gain or loss on debt extinguishment since it represents a cost that is not a good indicator of equinix s current or future operating performance equinix includes an income tax expense adjustment which represents the non cash tax impact due to changes in valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions that do not relate to the current period s operations equinix excludes recurring capital expenditures which represent expenditures to extend the useful life of its ibx data centers or other assets that are required to support current revenues equinix also excludes net income or loss from discontinued operations net of tax which represents results that are not a good indicator of our current or future operating performance equinix presents constant currency results of operations which is a non gaap financial measure and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to gaap results of operations however equinix has presented this non gaap financial measure to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate its operating results without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates thereby facilitating period to period comparisons of equinix s business performance to present this information equinix s current and comparative prior period revenues and certain operating expenses from entities with functional currencies other than the u s dollar are converted into u s dollars at a consistent exchange rate for purposes of each result being compared non gaap financial measures are not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap non gaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation but should be considered together with the most directly comparable gaap financial measures and the reconciliation of the non gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures equinix presents such non gaap financial measures to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate its operating results in a manner that focuses on what management believes to be its core ongoing business operations management believes that the inclusion of these non gaap financial measures provides consistency and comparability with past reports and provides a better understanding of the overall performance of the business and its ability to perform in subsequent periods equinix believes that if it did not provide such non gaap financial information investors would not have all the necessary data to analyze equinix effectively investors should note that the non gaap financial measures used by equinix may not be the same non gaap financial measures and may not be calculated in the same manner as those of other companies investors should therefore exercise caution when comparing non gaap financial measures used by us to similarly titled non gaap financial measures of other companies equinix does not provide forward looking guidance for certain financial data such as depreciation amortization accretion stock based compensation net income or loss from operations cash generated from operating activities and cash used in investing activities and as a result is not able to provide a reconciliation of gaap to non gaap financial measures for forward looking data without unreasonable effort the impact of such adjustments could be significant equinix intends to calculate the various non gaap financial measures in future periods consistent with how they were calculated for the periods presented within this press release forward looking statements this press release contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties actual results may differ materially from expectations discussed in such forward looking statements factors that might cause such differences include but are not limited to the challenges of acquiring operating and constructing ibx data centers and developing deploying and delivering equinix products and solutions unanticipated costs or difficulties relating to the integration of companies we have acquired or will acquire into equinix a failure to receive significant revenues from customers in recently built out or acquired data centers failure to complete any financing arrangements contemplated from time to time competition from existing and new competitors the ability to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds to repay new or outstanding indebtedness the loss or decline in business from our key customers risks related to our taxation as a reit and other risks described from time to

adjusted ebitda and ebitda we use the terms adjusted ebitda and ebitda throughout this earnings release adjusted ebitda and ebitda as the company defines them are non gaap measures we define consolidated adjusted ebitda as net income attributable to hyatt hotels corporation plus its pro rata share of unconsolidated hospitality ventures adjusted ebitda based on its ownership percentage of each venture adjusted to exclude the following items interest expense provision for income taxes depreciation and amortization amortization of management and franchise agreement assets constituting payments to customers contra revenue revenues for the reimbursement of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties equity earnings losses from unconsolidated hospitality ventures stock based compensation expense gains losses on sales of real estate asset impairments and other income loss net effective january 1 2018 we made two modifications to our definition of adjusted ebitda with the implementation of asu 2014 09 revenue from contracts with customers our definition has been updated to exclude contra revenue which was previously recognized as amortization expense as this is strictly a matter of financial presentation we have excluded contra revenue in order to be consistent with our prior treatment and to reflect the way in which we manage our business we have also excluded revenues for the reimbursement of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties these revenues and costs previously netted to zero within adjusted ebitda under asu 2014 09 the recognition of certain revenue differs from the recognition of related costs creating timing differences that would otherwise impact adjusted ebitda we have not changed our management of these revenues or expenses nor do we consider these timing differences to be reflective of our core operations these changes reflect how our management evaluates each segment s performance and also facilitate comparison with our competitors we have applied this change to 2017 historical results to allow for comparability between the periods presented we calculate consolidated adjusted ebitda by adding the adjusted ebitda of each of our reportable segments and eliminations to corporate and other adjusted ebitda our board of directors and executive management team focus on adjusted ebitda as a key performance and compensation measure both on a segment and on a consolidated basis adjusted ebitda assists us in comparing our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis because it removes from our operating results the impact of items that do not reflect our core operations both on a segment and on a consolidated basis our president and chief executive officer who is our chief operating decision maker also evaluates the performance of each of our reportable segments and determines how to allocate resources to those segments in significant part by assessing the adjusted ebitda of each segment in addition the compensation committee of our board of directors determines the annual variable compensation for certain members of our management based in part on consolidated adjusted ebitda segment adjusted ebitda or some combination of both we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to investors because it provides investors the same information that the company uses internally for purposes of assessing operating performance and making compensation decisions adjusted ebitda and ebitda are not substitutes for net income attributable to hyatt hotels corporation net income or any other measure prescribed by gaap there are limitations to using non gaap measures such as adjusted ebitda and ebitda although we believe that adjusted ebitda can make an evaluation of our operating performance more consistent because it removes items that do not reflect our core operations other companies in our industry may define adjusted ebitda differently than we do as a result it may be difficult to use adjusted ebitda or similarly named non gaap measures that other companies may use to compare the performance of those companies to our performance because of these limitations adjusted ebitda should not be considered as a measure of the income generated by our business our management compensates for these limitations by reference to its gaap results and using adjusted ebitda supplementally adjusted ebitda margin we define adjusted ebitda margin as adjusted ebitda divided by total revenues excluding contra revenue and revenues for the reimbursement of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties adjusted revenues we believe adjusted ebitda margin is useful to investors because it provides investors the same information that the company uses internally for purposes of assessing operating performance adjusted net income adjusted net income as we define it is a non gaap measure we define adjusted net income as net income attributable to hyatt hotels corporation excluding special items which are those items deemed not to be reflective of ongoing operations we consider adjusted net income to be an indicator of operating performance because excluding special items allows for period over period comparisons of our ongoing operations adjusted net income is not a substitute for net income attributable to hyatt hotels corporation net income or any other measure prescribed by gaap there are limitations to using non gaap measures such as adjusted net income although we believe that adjusted net income can make an evaluation of our operating performance more consistent because it removes special items that are deemed not to be reflective of ongoing operations other companies in our industry may define adjusted net income differently than we do as a result it may be difficult to use adjusted net income or similarly named non gaap measures that other companies may use to compare the performance of those companies to our performance because of these limitations adjusted net income should not be considered as a measure of the income generated by our business our management compensates for these limitations by reference to its gaap results and using adjusted net income supplementally adjusted selling general and administrative sg a expenses adjusted sg a expenses as we define it is a non gaap measure adjusted selling general and administrative expenses exclude the impact of deferred compensation plans funded through rabbi trusts and stock based compensation expense adjusted sg a expenses assist us in comparing our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis because it removes from our operating results the impact of items that do not reflect our core operations both on a segment and consolidated basis comparable owned and leased hotels operating margin we define comparable owned and leased hotels operating margin as the difference between comparable owned and leased hotels revenues and comparable owned and leased hotels expenses comparable owned and leased hotels revenues is calculated by removing non comparable hotels revenues from owned and leased hotels revenues as reported in our condensed consolidated statements of income comparable owned and leased hotels expenses is calculated by removing both non comparable owned and leased hotels expenses and the impact of expenses funded through rabbi trusts from owned and leased hotels expenses as reported in our condensed consolidated statements of income we believe comparable owned and leased hotels operating margin is useful to investors because it provides investors the same information that the company uses internally for purposes of assessing operating performance comparable hotels comparable system wide hotels represents all properties we manage or franchise including owned and leased properties and that are operated for the entirety of the periods being compared and that have not sustained substantial damage business interruption or undergone large scale renovations during the periods being compared or for which comparable results are not available we may use variations of comparable system wide hotels to specifically refer to comparable system wide americas full service or select service hotels for those properties that we manage or franchise within the americas management and franchising segment comparable system wide aspac full service or select service hotels for those properties that we manage or franchise within the aspac management and franchising segment or comparable system wide eame sw asia full service or select

and that are operated and consolidated for the entirety of the periods being compared and have not sustained substantial damage business interruption or undergone large scale renovations during the periods being compared or for which comparable results are not available comparable system wide hotels and comparable owned and leased hotels are commonly used as a basis of measurement in our industry non comparable system wide hotels or non comparable owned and leased hotels represent all hotels that do not meet the respective definition of comparable as defined above constant dollar currency we report the results of our operations both on an as reported basis as well as on a constant dollar basis constant dollar currency which is a non gaap measure excludes the effects of movements in foreign currency exchange rates between comparative periods we believe constant dollar analysis provides valuable information regarding our results as it removes currency fluctuations from our operating results we calculate constant dollar currency by restating prior period local currency financial results at the current period s exchange rates these restated amounts are then compared to our current period reported amounts to provide operationally driven variances in our results revenue per available room revpar revpar is the product of the average daily rate adr and the average daily occupancy percentage revpar does not include non room revenues which consist of ancillary revenues generated by a hotel property such as food and beverage parking and other guest service revenues our management uses revpar to identify trend information with respect to room revenues from comparable properties and to evaluate hotel performance on a regional and segment basis revpar is a commonly used performance measure in our industry revpar changes that are driven predominantly by changes in occupancy have different implications for overall revenue levels and incremental profitability than do changes that are driven predominantly by changes in average room rates for example increases in occupancy at a hotel would lead to increases in room revenues and additional variable operating costs including housekeeping services utilities and room amenity costs and could also result in increased ancillary revenues including food and beverage in contrast changes in average room rates typically have a greater impact on margins and profitability as average room rate changes result in minimal impacts to variable operating costs average daily rate adr adr represents

unless otherwise stated business overview corby is a leading canadian manufacturer marketer and importer of spirits and wines corby s national leadership is sustained by a diverse brand portfolio that allows the company to drive profitable organic growth with strong consistent cash flows corby is a publicly traded company with its shares listed on the toronto stock exchange under the symbols csw a voting class a common shares and csw b non voting class b common shares corby s voting class a common shares are majority owned by hiram walker sons limited hwsl a private company located in windsor ontario hwsl is a wholly owned subsidiary of international spirits and wine company pernod ricard s a pr a french public limited company which is headquartered in paris france therefore throughout the remainder of this md a corby refers to hwsl as its parent and to pr as its ultimate parent affiliated companies are those that are also subsidiaries of pr the company derives its revenues from the sale of its owned brands case goods as well as earning commission income from the representation of selected non owned brands in canada commissions the company also supplements these primary sources of revenue with other ancillary activities incidental to its core business such as logistics fees and from time to time bulk whisky sales to rebalance its maturation inventories revenue from corby s owned brands predominantly consists of sales made to each of the provincial liquor boards lbs in canada and also includes sales to international markets corby s portfolio of owned brands includes some of the most renowned brands in canada including j p wiser s canadian whisky lamb s rum polar ice vodka and mcguinness liqueurs in addition to the recently acquired ungava gin chic choc spiced rum cabot trail maple cream liqueur coureur des bois in quebec collectively the ungava spirit brands and the foreign affair wine brands including temptress enchanted amarosé and the conspiracy brands

whiskies jameson irish whiskey beefeater gin malibu rum kahlúa liqueur mumm champagne and jacob s creek wyndham estate stoneleigh campo viejo graffigna and kenwood wines in addition to representing pr s brands in canada corby also provides representation for certain selected unrelated third party brands agency brands when they fit within the company s strategic direction and thus complement corby s existing brand portfolio pr produces the majority of corby s owned brands under a distillate agreement and a co pack agreement each expiring september 30 2026 at hwsl s production facility in windsor ontario under an administrative services agreement which also expires september 30 2026 corby manages pr s business interests in canada including hwsl s production facility corby sources more than 90 of its spirits production requirements from hwsl at its production facility in windsor ontario corby s wholly owned subsidiary ungava spirits co ltd ungava spirits produces the ungava spirits brands and operates the cowansville quebec production facility corby s wholly owned subsidiary the foreign affair winery ltd produces the foreign affair wines and operates the winery and vineyard based in ontario s niagara region the foreign affair winery the company s remaining production requirements have been outsourced to various third party vendors including a third party manufacturer in the united kingdom uk the uk site blends and bottles lamb s products destined for sale in countries located outside north america in most provinces corby s route to market in canada entails shipping its products to government controlled lbs the lbs then sell directly or control the sale of beverage alcohol products to end consumers exceptions to this model include alberta where the retail sector is privatized in this province corby ships products to a bonded warehouse that is managed by a government appointed service provider who is responsible for warehousing and distribution into the retail channel other provinces have aspects of both government controlled and private retailing including british columbia saskatchewan and quebec corby s shipment patterns to the lbs will not always exactly match short term consumer purchase patterns however given the importance of monitoring consumer consumption trends over the long term the company stays abreast of consumer purchase patterns in canada through its member affiliation with the association of canadian distillers acd which tabulates and disseminates consumer purchase information it receives from the lbs to its industry members corby refers to this data throughout this md a as retail sales which are measured in volume measured in nine litre case equivalents current retail value information as discussed in this md a is based on available pricing information as provided by the acd and the lbs in addition to a focus on efforts to open new international markets corby s international business is concentrated in the united states us and uk and the company has a different route to market for each for the us market corby manufactures its products in canada and ships to third party us distributors the market in the us operates a three tier distribution system which often requires a much longer and larger inventory pipeline than in other markets resulting in a disconnect between quarterly shipment performance as reported in the financial statements and the true underlying performance of the brands at retail level during the same quarter for the uk market corby entered into a distribution agreement with a related party for the distribution of lamb s rum more information is provided in the related party transactions section of this md a and a co packing agreement for the production of the brand was entered into with angus dundee distillers plc a third party manufacturer each of which is effective as of july 1 2016 for other international markets corby manufactures its products in canada and ships to third party distributors corby s operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations sales are typically strong in the first and second quarters while third quarter sales usually decline after the end of the retail holiday season fourth quarter sales typically increase again with the onset of warmer weather as consumers tend to increase their purchasing levels during the summer season in addition retail sales comparisons can be affected by timing of key holidays and lb reporting calendars strategies and outlook corby s business strategies are designed to maximize sustainable long term value growth and thus deliver solid profit while continuing to produce strong and consistent cash flows from operating activities the company s portfolio of owned and represented brands provides an excellent platform from which to achieve its current and long term objectives management believes that having a focused brand prioritization strategy will permit corby to capture market share in the segments and markets that are expected to deliver the most growth in value over the long term therefore the company s strategy is to focus its investments on and leverage the long term growth potential of its key brands as a result corby will continue to invest behind those brands to promote its premium offerings where it makes the most sense and drives the most value for corby shareholders brand prioritization requires an evaluation of each brand s potential to deliver upon this strategy and facilitates corby s marketing and sales teams focus and resource allocation over the long term management believes that effective execution of this strategy will result in value creation for corby shareholders pursuing new growth opportunities outside of canada is also a key strategic priority our primary goal is to leverage our canadian whisky and gin expertise and expand our business into markets where we believe there is growth potential in both volume and margin of primary importance to the successful implementation of our brand strategies is an effective route to market strategy corby is committed to investing in its trade marketing expertise and ensuring that its commercial resources are specialized to meet the differing needs of its customers and the selling channels they inhabit in all areas of the business management believes setting clear strategies optimizing organization structure and increasing efficiencies is key to corby s overall success in addition management is convinced that both innovation and acquisitions are essential to seizing new profit and growth opportunities successful innovation can be delivered through a structured and efficient process as well as consistent investment in consumer insight and research and development corby benefits from having access to leading edge practices at pr s north american hub which is located in windsor ontario where most of its products are manufactured corby assesses potential acquisition opportunities against specific criteria including its core competencies and strategic priorities finally the company is a strong advocate of social responsibility especially with respect to its sales and promotional activities corby will continue to promote the responsible consumption of its products in its activities as an example corby has an agreement in place to continue its successful partnership

periods beginning on or after january 1 2018 and was therefore applied for the first time by the company for the interim period beginning july 1 2018 the company adopted ifrs 15 using the full retrospective approach with restatement of prior year comparative figures after completing the analysis of significant customer contracts the company determined that the implementation of ifrs 15 did not result in a significant impact to the company s financial position and performance the application of ifrs 15 has required that certain advertising and promotional expenditures previously reported in marketing sales and administration when paid directly to customers be classified as a reduction to revenue for the year ended june 30 2018 the implementation of ifrs 15 resulted in a reduction to revenue from case goods sales of 0 9 million with a corresponding reduction to marketing sales and administration there was no impact to net earnings the company s balance sheet or statement of cash

term of their respective agreements iii other services other services include revenue from ancillary activities including logistics fees and bulk whisky sales logistics fees are recognized as services are rendered bulk whisky sales are recognized when control of the goods has been transferred to the customer ii financial instruments the iasb has issued a new standard ifrs 9 financial instruments ifrs 9 which will ultimately replace ias 39 financial instruments recognition and measurement ias 39 the replacement of ias 39 is a multi phase project with the objective of improving and simplifying the reporting for financial instruments and the issuance of ifrs 9 is part of the first phase of this project ifrs 9 uses a single approach to determine whether a financial asset or liability is measured at amortized cost or fair value replacing the multiple rules in ias 39 for financial assets the approach in ifrs 9 is based on how an entity manages its financial instruments in the context of its business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets ifrs 9 requires a single impairment method to be used replacing multiple impairment methods in ias 39 for financial liabilities measured at fair value fair value changes due to changes in an entity s own credit risk are presented in other comprehensive income this standard is effective for annual periods

annual and interim filings foreign affair winery was excluded from the company s conclusions over disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting for the 365 day allowable period subsequent to the acquisition to allow for the assessment of the design effectiveness of foreign affair winery s disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting the company has completed its assessment of foreign affair winery s control environment and incorporated it in the company s assessment of the design effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting except for the preceding changes there were no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the company s most recent interim period that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company s internal controls over financial reporting risks risk management the company is exposed to a number of risks in the normal course of its business that have the potential to affect its operating and financial performance industry and regulatory the beverage alcohol industry in canada is subject to government policy extensive regulatory requirements and significant rates of taxation at both the federal and provincial levels as a result changes in the government policy regulatory and or taxation environments within the beverage alcohol industry may affect corby s business operations causing changes in market dynamics or changes in consumer consumption patterns in addition the company s provincial lb customers have the ability to mandate changes that can lead to increased costs as well as other factors that may impact financial results additionally as the company becomes more reliant on international product sales in the us uk and other countries exposure to changes in the laws and regulations including on matters such as regulatory requirements import duties and taxation in those countries could also adversely affect the operations financial performance or reputation of the company the company continuously monitors the potential risk associated with any proposed changes to its government policy regulatory and taxation environments and as an industry leader actively participates in trade association discussions relating to new developments consumer consumption patterns beverage alcohol companies are susceptible to risks relating to changes in consumer consumption patterns consumer consumption patterns are affected by many external influences not the least of which is economic outlook and overall consumer confidence in the stability of the economy as a whole additionally the legalization of recreational cannabis in canada could have the potential to impact consumer consumption patterns with respect to beverage alcohol products corby offers a diverse portfolio of products across all major spirits categories and at various price points corby continues to identify and offer new innovations in order to address consumer desires distribution supply chain interruption the company is susceptible to risks relating to distributor and supply chain interruptions distribution in canada is largely accomplished through the government owned provincial lbs and therefore an interruption e g a labour strike for any length of time or a change in business model may have a significant impact on the company s ability to sell its products in a particular province and or market international sales are subject to the variations in distribution systems within each country where the products are sold supply chain interruptions including a manufacturing or inventory disruption could impact product quality and availability the company adheres to a comprehensive suite of quality programmes and proactively manages production and supply chains to mitigate any potential risk to consumer safety or corby s reputation and profitability inherent to producing maturing products there is a potential for shortages or surpluses in future years if demand and supply are materially different from long term forecasts additionally the loss through contamination fire or other natural disaster of the stock of maturing products may result in significant reduction in supply and as a result corby may not be able to meet customer demands the company monitors category trends and regularly reviews maturing inventory levels environmental compliance environmental liabilities may potentially arise when companies are in the business of manufacturing products and thus required to handle potentially hazardous materials as corby largely outsources its production including all of its storage and handling of maturing alcohol the risk of environmental liabilities is considered minimal corby currently has no significant recorded or unrecorded environmental liabilities industry consolidation in recent years the global beverage alcohol industry has continued to experience consolidation industry consolidation can have varying degrees of impact and in some cases may even create exceptional opportunities either way management believes that the company is well positioned to deal with this or other changes to the competitive landscape in canada and other markets in which it carries on business corby s ability to properly complete acquisitions and subsequently integrate them may affect its results corby monitors growth opportunities that may present themselves to corby including by way of acquisitions while we believe that an acquisition may create the opportunity to realize certain benefits achieving these benefits will depend in part on successfully consolidating functions and integrating operations procedures and personnel in an efficient manner as well as our ability to realize any anticipated growth opportunities or costs savings from combining the target s assets and operations with our existing brands and operations integration efforts following any acquisition including the recent acquisitions of the ungava spirits brands and foreign affair winery may require the dedication of substantial management effort time and resources which may divert management s focus and resources from other strategic opportunities and from operational matters during this process in addition corby may be required to assume greater than expected liabilities due to liabilities that are undisclosed at the time of completion of an acquisition a failure to realize in whole or in part the anticipated benefits of an acquisition may have a negative impact on the results or financial position of corby competition the canadian and international beverage alcohol industry is extremely competitive competitors may take actions to establish and sustain a competitive advantage through advertising and promotion and pricing strategies in an effort to maintain market share which may negatively affect our sales revenues and profitability corby constantly monitors the market and adjusts its own advertising promotion and pricing strategies as appropriate competitors may also affect corby s ability to attract and retain high quality employees the company s long heritage attests to corby s strong foundation and successful execution of its strategies its role as a leading canadian beverage alcohol company helps facilitate recruitment efforts credit risk credit risk arises from deposits in cash management pools held with pr via corby s participation in the mirror netting service agreement as previously described in the related party transactions section of this md a as well as credit exposure to customers including outstanding accounts receivable the maximum exposure to credit risk is equal to the carrying value of the company s financial assets the objective of managing counter party credit risk is to prevent losses in financial assets the company assesses the credit quality of its counter parties taking into account their financial position past experience and other factors as the large majority of corby s accounts receivable balances are collectible from government controlled lbs management believes the company s credit risk relating to accounts receivable is at an acceptably low level exposure to interest rate fluctuations the company does not have any short or long term debt facilities interest rate risk exists as corby earns market rates of interest on its deposits in cash management pools an active risk management programme does not exist as management believes that changes in interest rates would not have a material impact on corby s financial position over the long term exposure to commodity price fluctuations commodity risk exists as the manufacture of corby s products requires the procurement of several known commodities such as grains sugar and natural gas the company strives to partially mitigate this risk through the use of longer term procurement contracts where possible in addition subject to competitive conditions the company may pass on commodity price changes to consumers through pricing over the long term foreign currency exchange risk the company has exposure to foreign currency risk as it conducts business in multiple foreign currencies however its exposure is primarily limited to the us dollar usd and uk pound sterling gbp corby does not utilize derivative instruments to manage this risk subject to competitive conditions changes in foreign currency rates may be passed on to consumers through pricing over the long term usd exposure the company s demand for usd has traditionally outpaced its supply due to usd sourcing of production inputs and advertising promotion expenses exceeding that of the company s usd sales therefore decreases in the value of the canadian dollar cad relative to the usd will have an unfavourable impact on the company s earnings gbp exposure the company s exposure to fluctuations in the value of the gbp relative to the cad was reduced as both sales and cost of production are denominated in gbp while corby s exposure has been minimized increases in the value of the cad relative to the gbp will have an unfavourable impact on the company s earnings third party service providers hwsl which corby manages on behalf of pr provides more than 90 of the company s production requirements among other services including administration and information technology however the company is reliant upon certain third party service providers in respect of certain of its operations it is possible that negative events affecting these third party service providers could in turn negatively impact the company while the company has no direct control over how such third parties are managed it has entered into contractual arrangements to formalize these relationships in order to minimize operating risks the company actively monitors and manages its relationships with its third party service providers brand reputation and trademark protection the company promotes nationally branded non proprietary products as well as proprietary products damage to the reputation of any of these brands or to the reputation of any supplier or manufacturer of these brands could negatively impact consumer opinion of the company or the related products which could have an adverse impact on the financial performance of the company the company strives to mitigate such risks by selecting only those products from suppliers that strategically complement corby s existing brand portfolio and by actively monitoring brand advertising and promotion activities additionally although the company registers trademarks as applicable it cannot be certain that trademark registrations will be issued with respect to all the company s applications also while corby constantly watches for and responds to competitive threats as necessary the company cannot predict challenges to or prevent a competitor from challenging the validity of any existing or future trademark issued or licensed to corby information technology and cyber security the company uses technology supplied by third parties both related and non related to support operations and invests in information technology to improve route to market reporting analysis and marketing initiatives issues with availability reliability and security of systems and technology could adversely impact the company s ability to compete resulting in corruption or loss of data regulatory related issues litigation or brand reputation damage with the fast paced changing nature of the technology environment including digital marketing the company works with these third parties to maintain policies processes and procedures to help secure and protect these information systems as well as consumer corporate and employee data valuation of goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets account for a significant amount of the company s total assets goodwill and intangible assets are subject to impairment tests that involve the determination of fair value inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates including but not limited to projected future sales earnings and capital investment discount rates and terminal growth rates these judgments and estimates may change in the future due to uncertain competitive market and general economic conditions or as the company makes changes in its business strategies given the current state of the economy certain of the aforementioned factors affecting the determination of fair value may be impacted and as a result the company s financial results may be adversely affected the following table summarizes corby s goodwill and intangible assets and details the amounts associated with each brand or basket of brands and market as at december 31 2018 carrying values as at december 31 2018 associated brand associated market goodwill intangibles total various pr brands canada 15 9 15 9 lamb s rum united kingdom 1 1 3 11 8 13 1 ungava brands 2 canada 5 1 3 2 8 3 foreign affair winery brands canada 0 4 2 5 2 9 other domestic brands canada 1 9 1 9 8 7 33 4 42 1 1 the international business for lamb s rum is primarily focused in the uk however the trademarks and licences purchased relate to all international markets outside of canada as corby previously owned the canadian rights 2 the ungava brands include trademarks related to ungava premium canadian gin chic choc spiced rum and cabot trail maple based liqueurs therefore economic factors such as consumer consumption patterns specific to these brands and markets are primary drivers of the risk associated with their respective goodwill and intangible assets valuations employee future benefits the company has certain obligations under its registered and non registered defined benefit pension plans and other post retirement benefit plan there is no assurance that the company s benefit plans will be able to earn the assumed rate of return new regulations and market driven changes may result in changes in the discount rates and other variables which would result in the company being required to make contributions in the future that differ significantly from estimates an extended period of depressed capital markets and low interest rates could require the company to make contributions to these plans in excess of those currently contemplated which in turn could have an adverse impact on the financial performance of the company somewhat mitigating the impact of a potential market decline is the fact that the company monitors its pension plan assets closely and follows strict guidelines to ensure that pension fund investment portfolios are diversified in line

financial statements have been prepared in accordance with international accounting standard 34 interim financial reporting ias 34 as issued by the international accounting standards board iasb these interim condensed consolidated financial statements follow the same accounting policies as the most recent annual consolidated financial statements except for changes in accounting policies and methods described below these interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the company s 2018 annual financial statements these interim condensed consolidated

financial income basis of measurement these interim condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost model except for certain categories of assets and liabilities which are measured in accordance with other methods provided for by ifrs as described in the most recent annual consolidated financial statements except for recently adopted policies and methods described below historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for assets use of estimates and judgements the preparation of these interim condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with ifrs requires management to make certain judgements estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the interim condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period these estimates are made on the assumption the company will continue as a going concern and are based on information available at the time of preparation estimates may be revised where the circumstance on which they were based changes or where new information becomes available future outcomes can differ from these estimates judgment is commonly used in determining whether a balance or transaction should be recognized in the interim condensed consolidated financial statements and estimates and assumptions are more commonly used in determining the measurement of recognized transactions and balances however judgment and estimates are often interrelated estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant estimates are made on the assumption the company will continue as a going concern and are based on information available at the time of preparation estimates may be revised where the circumstance on which they were based changes or where new information becomes available future outcomes can differ from these estimates estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected management s most critical estimates in determining the value of assets and liabilities and the most critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have a significant risk of causing material adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next year have been described in note 2 of the company s most recent annual consolidated financial statements seasonality the interim condensed consolidated financial statements should not be taken as indicative of the performance to be expected for the full fiscal year due to the seasonal nature of the spirits business corby s operations are typically subject to seasonal fluctuations in that the retail holiday season generally results in an increase in consumer purchases over the course of october november and december further the summer months traditionally result in higher consumer purchases of spirits as compared to the winter and spring months as a result the company s first and second quarter of each fiscal year tend to reflect the impact of seasonal fluctuations in that more shipments are typically made during those quarters ii adoption of new and revised standards and interpretations recent accounting pronouncements a number of new standards amendments to standards and interpretations were effective for corby on july 1 2018 and accordingly have been applied in preparing these interim condensed consolidated financial statements a revenue in may 2014 the international accounting standards board iasb issued ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers ifrs 15 which provides a comprehensive framework for the recognition measurement and disclosure of revenue from contracts with customers ifrs 15 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after january 1 2018 and was therefore applied for the first time by the company for the interim period beginning july 1 2018 the company adopted ifrs 15 using the full retrospective approach with restatement of prior year comparative figures after completing the analysis of significant customer contracts the company determined that the implementation of ifrs 15 did not result in a significant impact to the company s financial position and performance the application of ifrs 15 has required that certain advertising and promotional expenditures previously reported in marketing sales and administration when paid directly to customers be classified as a reduction to revenue for the year ended june 30 2018 the implementation of ifrs 15 resulted in a reduction to revenue from case goods sales of 871 with a corresponding reduction to marketing sales and administration there was no impact to net earnings the company s balance sheet or statement of cash flows the following chart summarizes the impact of ifrs 15 on the company s interim condensed consolidated statement of earnings for the three and six month periods ending december 31 2017 three months ended six months ended dec 31 dec 31 statement of earnings impacts 2017 2017 revenue 176 512 marketing sales administration 176 512 earnings from operations net earnings the company s accounting policies for revenues have been updated to reflect the more extensive requirements under ifrs 15 and are outlined below the company derives its revenue from case goods sales commissions and other services the company recognizes revenue when control of the goods or services sold has been transferred to the customer revenue is measured at the amount of consideration to which the company expects to be entitled after deducting trade discounts volume rebates sales related taxes and duties and costs of services directly provided by customers i case goods sales corby s case goods are primarily sold to provincial liquor boards and international customers transfer of control over case goods is achieved when products are shipped from the company s various distribution sites and accepted by the customer for sales to consumers through the company s winery retail store the transfer of control is deemed to occur when the product is purchased by the consumer case goods sales are recorded net of trade discounts volume rebates sales related taxes and duties and costs of services provided directly by customers which include distribution listing costs for new products promotional activities at point of sale and other advertising and promotional services ii commissions when the company acts in the capacity of an agent rather than as the principal in a transaction revenue is recognized in the amount of the commission to which the company is contractually entitled in exchange for representation services performed commissions are reported net of amortization of long term representation rights the long term representation rights represent the cost of the company s exclusive right to represent pr s brands in canada and are amortized on a straight line basis over the term of their respective agreements iii other services other services include revenue from ancillary activities including logistics fees and bulk whisky sales logistics fees are recognized as services are rendered bulk whisky sales are recognized when control of the goods has been transferred to the customer b financial instruments the iasb has issued a new standard ifrs 9 financial instruments ifrs 9 which will ultimately replace ias 39 financial instruments recognition and measurement ias 39 the replacement of ias 39 is a multi phase project with the objective of improving and simplifying the reporting for financial instruments and the issuance of ifrs 9 is part of the first phase of this project ifrs 9 uses a single approach to determine whether a financial asset or liability is measured at amortized cost or fair value replacing the multiple rules in ias 39 for financial assets the approach in ifrs 9 is based on how an entity manages its financial instruments in the context of its business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets ifrs 9 requires a single impairment method to be used replacing multiple impairment methods in ias 39 for financial liabilities measured at fair value fair value changes due to changes in an entity s own credit risk are presented in other comprehensive income this standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after january 1 2018 and must be applied retrospectively for corby this standard became effective july 1 2018 and has been applied retrospectively to all periods presented the adoption of ifrs 9 did not have a significant impact on the company s interim condensed consolidated financial statements financial assets and liabilities have been classified and measured in accordance with ifrs 9 as a result of the application of ifrs 9 and classifications there has been no change to the carrying value of financial assets and liabilities changes to the classification of corby s financial assets and liabilities under ifrs 9 are as follows financial asset liability category under ias 39 category under ifrs 9 deposits in cash management pools loans and receivables amortized cost accounts receivable loans and receivables amortized cost accounts payable and accrued liabilities

638 oz total cash cost per ounce of 448 oz q3 2018 549 oz decreased by 18 the significant increase in production was due to the higher head grade milled 24 and slightly higher throughput total cash cost per ounce decreased on the back of the higher grade and production as well as slightly lower strip ratio operating profit for the quarter was 55 7 million compared to 32 0 million in the previous quarter reflecting the higher gold produced lower operating cost and higher average gold price received profit from mining activity for the quarter of 68 3 million was 50 higher than the previous

265 602 4 303 469 extracted from the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended 31 december 2017 these results are presented as the fourth quarter ended 31 december 2018 they have been prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards as issued by the iasb ifrs on a basis that is consistent with the accounting policies applied by the group in its audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 december 2017 and which formed the basis of the 2017 annual report the company has adopted ifrs 9 financial instruments and ifrs 15 revenue from customers in the twelve month period ending 31 december 2018 following the standards becoming effective for periods commencing on or after 1 january 2018 ifrs 9 financial instruments addresses the classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities and replaces the guidance in ias 39 that relates to the classification and measurement of financial instruments ifrs 9 retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three primary measurement categories for financial assets amortised cost fair value through other comprehensive income oci and fair value through profit or loss the basis of classification depends on the entity s business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset there is now a new expected credit loss model that replaces the incurred loss impairment model used in ias 39 the adoption of ifrs 9 did not result in any material change to the consolidated results of the group from the beginning of the earliest period presented following an assessment of the consolidated financial assets no changes to classification of those financial assets was required the group has applied the expected credit loss impairment model to its financial assets focused in particular on its long term loans to its asset leasing joint ventures which hold mining equipment and no material credit losses are considered to apply the group s vat receivables detailed below are excluded from the scope of ifrs 9 ifrs 15 introduced a single framework for revenue recognition and clarify principles of revenue recognition this standard modifies the determination of when to recognise revenue and how much revenue to recognise the core principle is that an entity recognises revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods and services to the customer of an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the adoption of ifrs 15 did not result in any material change to the group s revenue recognition from the beginning of the earliest period presented following analysis of the gold sales contracts held by its mining operations the company enters into a contract for the sale of gold at each of its mining operations the group s performance obligation under each of the contracts is to supply such gold to the customer subject to minimum quality specifications with the consideration for such gold sales determined by the market spot price for each ounce of gold at the point of sale and gold content as the sales from gold contracts are subject to customer survey adjustment sales are initially recorded based on the results of tests on the material prior to shipment to determine the gold content and specification with such estimates subsequently adjusted to reflect the final gold content determined by the customer shortly after period end revenue is recorded to the extent that it is highly probable that there will be no subsequent reversal of such revenue due to gold content or quality specifications historical adjustments of this nature have been insignificant the performance obligations are considered to be satisfied and control of the gold transferred as the gold leaves the gold room upon collection by the customer with title possession and significant risks and rewards transferred at this point with revenue recorded accordingly this announcement has been prepared in accordance with the measurement and recognition principles of ifrs these results do not include all the notes of the type normally included in an annual financial statement accordingly this announcement is to be read in conjunction with the annual report for the year 31 december 2017 and any public announcements made b
what has been will be again what has been done will be done again there is nothing new under the sun ecclesiastes 1 9 the year 33 ad was marked by two disturbances throughout the roman empire the first was the crucifixion of jesus christ who was tried before pontius pilot and then crucified to give rise to a new world religion the other monumental event was the great financial panic of the same year that shook the roman empire to its core my concern here is of the latter event and its lessons for today s financial system like all great financial crises and panics there were events preceding the financial calamity that went unnoticed until they erupted into a contagion that shook the very foundations of the financial system our story begins in 31 ad with the arrest and execution of lucius aelius sejanus a former prefect of the praetorian guard then consul of rome and confident of the emperor tiberius sejanus was well connected with the financial elite in rome and the banking houses along the via sacra the wall street of its day sejanus was involved in a plot to become emperor and tiberius s successor unfortunately for sejanus the plot was discovered by the emperor which lead not only to his arrest and execution but that of his followers and supporters as well the political intrigue of 31 ad set the stage for the economic meltdown that followed sejanus followers were hunted down tried executed and their lands confiscated becoming the property of the roman treasury this led to a series of events leading to a collapse in real estate prices a contraction of the money supply and a severe recession throughout the empire agriculture and land were by far the most important sector of the roman economy next to trade the value of land and the cost of lending it soon became the epicenter of the crisis that followed the practice of usury had long plagued rome resulting in high interest rates and harsh enforcement of contractual terms julius caesar attempted to remedy the problem by passing a law requiring that creditors had to invest a certain portion of their capital in italian land in order to lend at interest the law fell into disuse over the following years after caesar s death but remained on the books forgotten until it was revived in 33 ad in an attempt to support the italian agricultural interest then in decline a habit of governments throughout the centuries and to our present day with confiscation of sejanus and his followers the senate with the assent of the emperor tiberius ordered one third of every senator s fortune be invested in lands within italy in an attempt to prop up falling prices failure to comply invited prosecution penalties even death senators were given 18 months to comply with the new law time elapsed and in 33 ad panic developed as the rich senators scrambled to find capital to buy land they began to call in all private loans and deposits with their bankers the arch of titus on the via sacra the wall street of ancient rome digital image courtesy of the getty s open content program what followed was a credit crisis creditors called in their loans in order to buy land and comply with the new laws a glut of land sales led to sale at auction at depressed prices instead of inflating asset values a deflationary force fell upon the empire those who were convicted of violating the law saw their property seized resulting in substantial amounts of coin flowing into the imperial treasury taking money out of circulation and contracting the money supply to make matters worse as so often happens in times of financial panic the roman senate doubled down on its resolution and passed a law requiring creditors to invest two thirds of their capital in italian land and that all debtors pay back the amount of their loans this was a massive deleveraging of the economy an ancient version of the savings and loan crisis in the u s during late 80s and early 90s resulting in the failure of 1 043 out of the 3 234 savings and loan associations between 1986 1995 the resolution as so many well meaning laws do had the opposite effect creditors began demanding that all loans be paid back in their entirety this only further accelerated the crisis as debtors began to sell off their lands in order to raise funds for repayment of their outstanding debt this flooded property onto the market at depressed prices instead of propping up prices the legislation drove prices down further and contracted the money supply with a scarcity of credit those who did manage to secure it turned to money lenders who charged exorbitant interest rates while there were good intentions the senate resolution ended up turning a smoldering flame into a full fledged crisis the senate resolution was intended to prop up land values but instead led to forced sales that brought more land onto the market further depressing prices like all deflationary periods creditors who did have capital held on to it figuring that land prices would continue to fall further with better deals at hand the new legislation resulted in collapsed land prices and tight unavailable credit that drove up interest rates the crisis spread beyond the via sacra and throughout the empire like today money and banking were connected throughout the roman world the firm of seuthes and son of alexandria in present day egypt faced difficulties when three richly laden treasure ships vanished in a red sea storm the loss resulted in a drop in the value of ostrich feathers and ivory associated with the firms ventures in the ethiopian caravan trade this started a string of events throughout the banking industry not long after the difficulties of seuthes and son the banking house of malchus company located in tyre in present day lebanon with factories in antioch and ephesus became bankrupt as a result of a strike initiated by phoenician workmen and the embezzlements of a trusted manager it was also discovered that the banking house of quintus maximus lucius vibo had large loans outstanding to both banking houses of seuthes and malchus as rumors spread throughout the financial system depositors feared for their money and began a run on the banks as distrust spread among investors this was no different than the collapse of lehman brothers that led to a domino of falling investment firms from aig to merrill lynch in 2008 the interconnectedness of loans between banking houses like 2008 spread throughout the empire on the via sacra even larger banking firms found themselves in trouble the banking house of the brothers pettius was also involved with maximus and vibo the firm was considered to be of high quality as they were well capitalized unfortunately for the brothers pettius their other securities were loans placed with the noblemen of belgae in north gaul parts of present day france belgium germany and italy the emerging markets of its day an outbreak of hostilities forced the government to decree a temporary suspension of processes for debt this left the house of pettius with inadequate resources maximus and vibo were the first to close their doors followed by the brothers petti the closure of these banking firms gave rise to a panic among the citizens as rumors floated to who was next due to the interconnected credits between firms many more banks were affected the folks at gavekal research are fond of using the dynamite fishing analogy a big explosion kills all marine life within a certain radius initially the small fish rise to the surface the bigger fish take longer to appear it is only later that the dead whale rises to top the dead whale in this case was the banking house of balbus ollius the triggering event was one of the richest men in rome publius spinther a wealthy nobleman who notified his bankers at balbus ollius that he wished to withdraw 30 000 000 sesterces he had on deposit with the bank in order to meet his land investment requirements the bank was unable to return his deposit and two days later closed their doors the bankruptcy of balbus ollius like lehman brothers centuries later triggered a run on the major banking houses and spread throughout the empire after balbus olius closed their doors a few days later the corinthian bank of leucippus became insolvent it didn t stop there as rumors swirled saying that a strong banking house in carthage was on the verge of closing along with two banks in lyons and others in byzantium the surviving banks along the via sacra announced they must have timely notice before paying their depositors one bank after another closed in succession legal interest rates were set at zero by anyone flush with cash and ready to lend it the praetor s court was filled with throngs of creditors demanding the auctioning of debtors assets from homes slaves warehouse stock furniture jewelry or anything of value that could be sold and liquidated valuable items were sold for a mere trifle triggered by the panic leaving many men of fortune reduced to beggary portrait of roman emperor tiberius digital image courtesy of the getty s open content program the financial panic engulfed most of the empire threatening to bring to a halt all commerce and industry the roman forum and senate were surrounded by rich and poor alike a mix of all classes of society looking for hope resolution and an end to the financial nightmare the praetor gracchus who headed the bankruptcy court was at his wits end trying to resolve impoverished debtors and desperate creditors alike out of frustration with no resolution at hand gracchus dispatched in haste a messenger to the emperor tiberius ensconced in his villa at capri somewhat oblivious to the crowds and the financial panic for four days the crowds and banking houses along the via sacra held their breath finally the messenger arrived the emperor tiberius solved the problem the solution was the first instance of quantitative easing for that we turn to the historian cornelius tacitus who wrote the book the annals the reigns of tiberius claudius and nero from which the following is excerpted the destruction of the family fortune began to hurl down rank and reputation but then tiberius brought aid by distributing a hundred million sesterces among the banks and by also providing opportunities for interest free loans over a three year period if the borrower gave the people security in land for double the amount borrowed credit was restored by these measures and gradually private lenders were also found to solve the crisis tiberius created large amounts of loans for bankers at a zero percent interest rate against good collateral rates were kept at zero percent for three years in our most recent crisis rates were kept at zero percent for seven years following a similar pattern to the roman emperor the u s federal reserved and the european central bank ecb kept interest rates at zero expanded their balance sheets through quantitative easing qe in an effort to recapitalize the banking system and to get the credit systems operating again there are general similarities between the crisis of 33 ad 2008 and 2012 in europe tiberius used the roman treasury to inject capital into a financial system on the verge of bankruptcy it was no different in 2008 with the introduction of tarp troubled asset relief program with the purpose of providing liquidity at a time like 33 ad when there was inherent difficulty in the pricing of assets whether it was mortgages or italian land for purposes of collateralization tiberius stabilized the financial system as did our central bank emperors like ben bernanke and qe or mario draghi s famous pledge to do whatever it takes to stabilize the european debt crisis the governments in the u s and in europe curbed the panic of the day by stepping in and backstopping the financial system with government bailouts and guarantees albeit today s financial system is much more sophisticated and complicated but the principals remain the same both periods in history were turbulent and it took several attempts before the politicians caught on to the gravity of the situation and proposed solutions that arrested the crisis and restored confidence the crisis of 2007 2009 is behind us and a new one may lie directly in front of us a problem with easy money is that it leads to higher levels of risk taking it also creates speculation whether it s hedge funds using leverage to turn nickels into dollars or if it s the general public chasing yields in bond funds or etfs where risk is high liquidity is low and the general public is ignorant and unaware of what they own like ancient rome our financial world is interconnected what happens elsewhere can boomerang back here whether it be italian debt here come the romans again emerging market debt or our own u s corporate debt our financial systems are linked through securitization the dispersion of debt and an international payment system the last crisis has come and gone and the next crisis may be in its formative stages central are starting to think how the next one will unfold and what the appropriate response will be recently the regional fed bank of san francisco offered us some clues a possible solution is actual negative interest rates not just zero rates the argument being that negative rates may have allowed inflation to rise much faster toward the fed s two percent inflation target as seen in the frbsf economic letter from february 2019 the new study makes the case that setting a negative rate of 0 25 percent would have been the best rate to speed the economic recovery pushing savers out of safe haven cash to either spend money or invest rather than suffer the consequences of cash remaining idle and unproductive this approach has not been used before but at least our bankers are now thinking of possible solutions ahead of time unlike 2008 the fed funds rate is at 2 5 percent a far cry from the five percent rate preceding the last crisis their balance sheets are loaded with trillions of dollars of government debt and mortgages how will they pay for the reliquification of the financial system and government fiscal policy used to stimulate the economy once again we can turn to tiberius and the romans after the panic subsided historian and author tacitus tells us in his book book the annals the reigns of tiberius claudius and nero that the emperor went after his enemies and those who didn t conform to the senatorial decree those who failed to comply were tried executed and their property confiscated for the good of the state the following is excerpted from the annals the richest man in the spanish provinces sextus marius was denounced for having incestuous relations with his daughter and he was thrown down from the tarpeian rock and to leave no doubt that it was really the extent of the man s wealth that had brought about his downfall tiberius set aside his gold and silver mines for himself although they were state confiscations it is no surprise as the next presidential election cycle begins we hear calls for raising marginal tax rates to 70 percent raising the estate tax an additional two to three percent tax on wealth trillion dollar carbon taxes and a raise of payroll taxes by an additional 2 5 percent with no limits as to taxation of salaries the last crisis has ended the next one may be in its formative stages the government and treasury will need money and the treasury will need to be replenished history marches forward but the problems remain the same debt and credit there is nothing new under the sun

slide 3 matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer advertisement advertisement thanks kevin and good morning 2018 has been a transformational year for colfax during which we reshaped our company and established an even stronger foundation for our future first we finished the year with strong financial results including earnings growth of 33 placing us well ahead of the commitment we made in december of 2017 esab achieved strong and accelerating sales growth across all regions including strong contributions from new products and the team has done a great job of protecting margins in a year of notable cost escalation our howden business recovered from the market challenges of late 2017 and the team has gotten the business firmly back on a path to mid teen segment margins they ve successfully grown sales in the faster growing industrial applications which are now half of the business and howden exits 2018 with strong momentum on both order growth and margins and is well placed for a strong performance in 2019 we ve successfully driven restructuring actions within both of our businesses and delivered 37 million of restructuring cost savings our progress improving the vitality of both businesses shows the power of cbs and supports our margin and growth improvement we completed the monetization of our fluid handling business at an attractive multiple of over 13 times ebitda and completed four new bolt on acquisitions that strengthen and diversify our esab and howden businesses advertisement advertisement we also announced that colfax has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire djo a leading global orthopedic solutions company this acquisition is consistent with our strategy to create a higher margin faster growing and less cyclical company to support our deleveraging plans and future growth investments we re exploring strategic options for our air and gas handling business including a potential sale we believe this will be a very attractive asset to potential acquirers given all the progress made to strengthen and diversify the business moving to slide 4 you can see the highlights from our fourth quarter results our operating performance was in line with expectations and tax benefits contributed to outperformance fabrication technology achieved strong sales growth from continued healthy market demand as well as new product launches and pricing actions completed throughout the year air and gas handling drove another quarter of double digit order growth with industrial remaining very strong aftermarket accelerating and most end use markets moving in a positive direction we increased this business margins through restructuring actions and a deeper application of our business system to improve operational execution this month we successfully completed the djo acquisition financing that started in the fourth quarter djo is a global leader in the attractive growing orthopedic solutions market and we re excited about the potential to apply our business system to further improve the business growth and profitability on slide 5 you can see esab continued growth and continued growth trajectory this was the eighth quarter in a row of core growth at esab and we continue to show double digit growth both overall and core while healthy margins around the world have been a positive factor in our growth we also launched 11 new products in 2018 increased our automation backlog and funnel and added some great acquisitions sandvik and gce that are performing well i was in europe recently with the gce team for our standard 100 day review process we already have a fast start there thoughtfully integrating our businesses in the welding market and identifying some exciting gas control growth plans in med tech and life sciences advertisement advertisement during the quarter we had some translational currency headwinds from the strengthening usd predominantly in our argentinian brazilian and russian businesses on slide 6 you can see esab s year to date and current quarter year over year adjusted operating profit performance the performance was in line with what i communicated on our outlook call in december margins of 11 6 excluding the october 2018 gce acquisition finished the year in line with 2017 now as i ve talked about on several calls now we had multiple sources of cost escalation during 2018 year to date pricing actions have delivered nearly 5 points of price to offset material and other inflation pressures and as these price actions are only covering inflation the business margin rates are being compressed by about 50 basis points both year to date and in the fourth quarter absent this pressure we would ve had another year of solid margin expansion in this business when we exclude the gce acquisition from q4 underlying adjusted operating margins were 11 2 this is a solid step forward from q3 and our team continued to execute price and productivity actions in q4 to enter 2019 firmly on the right side of the 2018 price cost improvement curve esab s margins are expected to take a step forward in 2019 as additional price and productivity actions flow through and the business has a clear path back to greater than 12 operating margins in the first half of 2019 the healthy margin expansion in our 2019 guidance is consistent with the our path to mid teens for this business advertisement advertisement slide 7 shows our continued progress reshaping air and gas handling business for less cyclical more profitable growth in the fourth quarter the business had 13 core order growth plus another couple of points from the recent aci and ach acquisitions we continue to achieve strong growth in our strategic industrial applications as core industrial orders grew 18 in the quarter oil and gas orders grew sequentially and the profitability of new orders continues to improve mining orders grew organically 141 as we secured a large order in the quarter at good margin levels finally our power markets remained stable and orders as expected stepped up sequentially in the fourth quarter on slide 8 the air and gas handling segment core sales grew 11 in the quarter supported by strong growth in industrial applications and as expected howden performed strongly on margins in the fourth quarter which improved 230 basis points sequentially and 440 basis points year over year to 12 1 this improvement came from price productivity restructuring and strategic choices that we ve made in oil and gas to focus on higher margin projects backlog ended the year a bit stronger than expected and both backlog size and margin levels support the guidance provided on our december outlook call advertisement advertisement on slide 9 i want to share with you how the colfax business system helped us to drive margin improvement in howden lead process improvement is often thought of as synonymous with manufacturing but cbs is a holistic business system that helps us to continuously improve across all business activities policy deployment is the core tool in the cbs tool kit and arguably our most powerful tool its purpose is to drive breakthrough change within our businesses to advance our strategies a great example of the impact of policy deployment can be found in the improvement in howden project management during 2018 in 2017 the howden leadership team had identified the opportunity to drive improvements in project execution on large newbuild projects which involve complex engineering solutions and teams around the world using policy deployment the howden team reengineered their end to end project management processes and built a stronger foundation for project execution this resulted in 2018 improvements in milestone delivery higher margins and better working capital these changes are now sustained standard work in the business this is a great example of how our teams use cbs to deliver improved service to customers and improve financial results on slide 10 we provide an update on our strategic initiatives the company recently completed the financing to support the acquisition of djo and refinance existing bank loans chris and his teams did a great job of getting this completed quickly and at attractive terms the djo acquisition is progressing as expected we completed regulatory filings and continue to target a q1 close our experienced integration team is fully engaged and we re all working closely with the djo team to ensure a smooth transition i was with the senior djo team in dallas recently for their initial cbs training and both sides are excited about the opportunities ahead the review of our air and gas handling strategic options is well under way goldman sachs and barclays are leading the efforts and we re moving with speed advertisement advertisement before i hand over to chris i want to comment on our strategic progress we ve strengthened our esab and howden businesses getting them on to solid path to growth and mid teens segment margins the recent djo new platform acquisition is entirely consistent with our strategic commitment to diversify and strengthen our portfolio we also see exciting opportunities to further expand in med tech in summary we made a lot of strategic and operational progress in 2018 and i expect a very successful year for colfax in 2019 now i d like to hand it over to chris who will discuss the financial results christopher hix senior vice president finance chief financial officer thank you matt on slide 11 you can see company sales grew 13 in the third quarter to 985 million reflecting a 11 organic growth and 7 from acquisitions mostly gce that was acquired in october of 2018 but also sandvik that was acquired earlier in the year we also faced a 5 currency translation headwind in the quarter from a stronger us dollar mostly compared with the argentine peso brazilian real and the russian ruble advertisement advertisement we grew gross profit by 36 million in the quarter and gross margin by 20 basis points due to continued growth at our fabtech business and very strong air and gas handling operating performance as matt mentioned earlier some of our margin progress has been obscured by the effect of using price to effectively offset inflation which grossed up esab s revenue and cost of goods sold and compressed its reported operating margins by 50 basis points and 20 basis points for colfax overall despite year over year fx translation pressure of nearly 5 million operating profit increased 23 million or 27 million excluding 4 million of one time transaction costs and inventory step up charges from the recent gce acquisition adjusted margins increased 150 basis points to 9 4 or 180 basis points to 9 7 before one time transaction costs and inventory step up charges during the quarter we sold an old esab facility as part of an ongoing colfaxwide program that has included six facilities over the past four years for total cumulative proceeds of about 43 million applying cbs drives productivity improvements that frees up capacity and enables footprint rationalization and higher efficiencies the net benefit of 11 million we recognized in the quarter from the facility sale was offset by non routine charges resulting from argentina hyperinflation receivable reserves for distributor and the impact of strengthening inventory standard work and processes below the line continued focus from our tax team contributed to this quarter s results as we drove the rate down to 17 overall q4 operating performance was in line with our expectations and a lower than projected tax rate contributed to the 53 increase in eps in the quarter slide 12 shows our progress on cash flow performance fourth quarter operating cash flow was 126 million versus 104 million last year with the improvement coming mostly from higher profitability this higher cash flow was delivered despite the significant growth at esab that required working capital investment the 7 million year over year increase in full year operating cash flow to 226 million does not tell the whole story the prior year results included 69 million of cash flow generated in the fluid handling business that we divested in december 2017 so the real improvement was 76 million on a consistent basis and we expect to make another healthy step forward in 2019 i ll finish my remarks on slide 13 by reaffirming the outlook we provided in december we started the new year with january results that were consistent with our expectations for the full year we continue to expect our fabrication technology business to grow high single digits including a full year contribution from the gce business we are forecasting stable material costs and the price increases over the past several quarters are expected to lap core growth is forecasted to be mid single digits about half price and half volume with operating margins exceeding 12 on the strength of restructuring and pricing actions including the rollover benefit from initiatives completed in 2018 and further productivity savings our air and gas handling business is expected to grow orders this year mid to high single digits led by continued growth in industrial applications and strengthening mining markets we continue to expect core growth to be flat plus or minus with continued margin growth from restructuring improved customer project execution and aftermarket initiatives after the djo acquisition is completed we will provide an update for our expectations for this year we continue to expect a strong year of profit growth in our existing businesses with adjusted operating profit growth of 20 or more that concludes our prepared remarks please open up the call for questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from mike halloran of baird your line is now open mike halloran robert w baird co analyst hey good morning everyone matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer how are you doing ph mike mike halloran robert w baird co analyst could you just talk a little bit about the underlying trends you re seeing on the fab tech side it certainly sounds like some consistency still despite all the headline noise globally but maybe a few more thoughts on the trajectory through the quarter into the first quarter so far any regional variances anything by product category that s interesting or showing particular strength or particular weakness as you look to the quarter matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yeah sure mike so obviously the back half last year was good and strong but that s kind of half and half growth between price and volume growth and some of the strongest parts down the stretch last year where north america as well as growth in automation in the business as we roll over into this year you can see in our guidance that we are still forecasting to have healthy growth in the business but lower than that double digit second half more of a mid single digits year this year and we re still seeing growth broad based growth but we do see expect to see the north america growth come down a little from from that higher spot that it went to last year and different places in the world a little to and fro here in the different emerging markets in the world mike halloran robert w baird co analyst out of curiosity are you seeing actual weakness on that growth are you just more or less referring to normal sequential patterns from what we re seeing here cumulatively and comparisons getting a little harder driving the deceleration matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yeah we re seeing we re seeing what we expect to see here in the fourth quarter in terms of some tougher comps and kind of a normal sequential patterns consistent with the guidance that we ve given mike halloran robert w baird co analyst okay sounds good there and then just a question on the price cost side as you work through the year fabtech same ph maybe just talk about the price cost curve in the fourth quarter and how you expect the cadence through the year with the moving parts with your pricing gains as well as the commodity swings we ve seen matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yeah sure well as i said in my remarks we passed through almost 100 million of price last year that 5 a little over 100 million that 5 number and that was throughout the year we cleared the air kind of on the right side of the equation there versus steel but definitely down the stretch in the air ph there were broader set of inflationary pressures that had us having to continue to drive price there in the third quarter and the fourth quarter even beyond just the steel impact and so as we roll over into the first half of this year we expect to be able to see nice sequential margin improvement in the business as those price actions continue to flow through and the productivity actions continue to flows through we see the steel environment has stabilized and so that provides an opportunity to limit the price actions to the other inflationary pressures in the business and to use some of the muscle that was created last year to get some net price in some of the key parts of the product line where there is a value based opportunity to drive net price improvement in the business mike halloran robert w baird co analyst appreciate the color matt thanks matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer thanks operator thank you our next question comes from jeff hammond of keybanc capital markets your line is now open jeff hammond keybanc capital markets analyst hi good morning gentlemen matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer good morning jeff christopher hix senior vice president finance chief financial officer hi jeff jeff hammond keybanc capital markets analyst so just to follow on on that the price cost like the 50 basis point headwind is that how do you see that kind of shaping up in 1q and kind of the cadence through the year just is all the gce acquisition noise kind of behind you matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yeah so the kind of mathematical price pressure of passing through price was kind of increased throughout last year but was consistent through most of last year and so i think we ll start to lap that we ll have a little bit of it in the first quarter as we move through the price absent more steel we will start to lap that mathematical impact of the price cost i think in terms of the earnings impact of the price cost we re entering q1 on the right side of that and expect to not have a price cost earnings drag and as we move through the year to have a little bit of benefit there and then gce certainly the biggest effect from the gce acquisition was in the fourth quarter based on when it came in and some of the early things that we do in acquisitions and we will have still a little bit of a drag from some of those early charges and things in the first and second quarter here but it will be much smaller than the fourth quarter jeff hammond keybanc capital markets analyst okay great and then matt you said you re moving with speed in air and gas process can you just talk about interest levels at this point and what you think best guess on timing is matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yeah we are really not going to comment on the specifics of the process we ve done all the right things to move into that process with speed and excellence and we ve got the business on a good healthy improving path and so we feel confident in our ability to drive to good outcome there but we re going to share information at the point that we think is appropriate to share it jeff hammond keybanc capital markets analyst okay and then just one housekeeping how should we think about tax rate for 19 with and without djo christopher hix senior vice president finance chief financial officer i ll speak to the tax rate without djo and then of course we will provide a bigger update once we ve closed the djo acquisition and we ll come back to the folks with a different sort of outlook without djo we re continuing to believe that the go forward sustainable tax rate for 2019 will be in the low sort of low 20s if you look back over time you can see that we ve driven the rate from that kind of low 30s high 20s down into the low 20s and we ve also taken advantage of other initiatives to drive the rate tactically down below 20 but on a sustainable basis right now we believe low 20s is the way to think about it jeff hammond keybanc capital markets analyst okay perfect thanks chris operator thank you our next question comes from andy kaplowitz of citi your line is now open brad citi research analyst good morning guys it s brad speaking ph on for andy matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer hi good morning brad citi research analyst so in fabtech you noted the new product has a contributed growth there and you ve obviously been very focused on reinvigorating the product portfolio there over the past couple of years can you give us some color maybe on how much the new products contributed to growth in 2019 ph and how you re thinking about new products as a contributor to growth in 19 and beyond matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yeah we definitely have made a lot of progress on that business on vitality and the amount of revenue coming from new products and that s helping our growth it s helping our brand and it is at this point broad based across the portfolio a few years back it was more concentrated on our equipment product line and we ve now got it more broad based across the portfolio our view is that the path to strong growth performance over time in that industry is that fresh products new products can get you a couple of points of growth that you wouldn t have if you didn t have fresh and newer products and so that s kind of how we view the path to consistently drive an industry plus growth is to have those good fresh and new products obviously the revenue contribution from them is larger than that but in terms of how much it differentiates your growth in any given point in time we think it s in that kind of a range brad citi research analyst okay that s great and then maybe just shifting to air and gas handling you had nice year over year growth in general industrial orders in the business really every quarter this year and we know that s been a big focus area for you can you talk about your visibility to sustaining continued momentum in general industrial growth within air and gas handling matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yes we have sustained the momentum there for quite some time now and we still have healthy funnels and ongoing initiatives across a broad set of industrial segments so we think the market environment supports ongoing industrial growth we see the momentum of our initiatives supporting continued growth there there s no question that like the rest of the business there is parts of it that are more project based and in a given point in time you might have a little more or a little less based on kind of which projects are coming when but between the broad based nature of the growth there and the external environment as well as our initiative based momentum we see the potential to continue that industrial growth in the business brad citi research analyst okay thanks guys i will get back in queue operator thank you our next question comes from joe giordano of cowen your line is now open joseph giordano cowen and company analyst hi guys good morning christopher hix senior vice president finance chief financial officer good morning joe matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer good morning joseph giordano cowen and company analyst so on your oil and gas orders i know the last couple of quarters matt you mentioned that there s been a lot of business out there and you ve kind of made a conscious decision to not pursue it because of the margins inherent there so you re seeing a little bit of sequential expansion in the order book there has the market strengthened there has there been any change or is it kind of an opportunistic project win how would you categorize that kind of progress matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer we see the oil and gas market has been gradually moving in a positive direction overall but if i start from our aftermarket presence in that market which is more with refineries than anything else that s been on a good improving path there and both the ongoing aftermarket and even some of the retrofit kind of projects there have been coming through and then second the part that we re strategically focused on now and going forward in terms of some of the kind of small to medium sized project based new project based opportunity there there are healthy funnels there s been some decent project flow it s still as it s been in the past few years it still continues to be real kind of start stop versus kind of a strong increasing trend but it s moving in the right direction and the funnels continue to build there in that business joseph giordano cowen and company analyst okay and then maybe last for me i feel like there s a lot of investor talk about djo and just familiarity with you guys in that type of business can you maybe discuss at a high level i know you re not going into detail yet but how does that business like what s the management structure how does that roll up to you can you talk about your how your past experiences with similar businesses give you comfort that in how you guys can run that business effectively matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yes sure i would say strategically we see that as a great add to our company that really moves us forward in a terrific way and that we ll be able to apply our compounding strategy into as it comes in brady shirley will lead the business he s got over 20 years in that orthopedic solutions industry he has been in the business for about four years led the implant business for a few years and did a great job getting that on a strong growth path and then he has led the overall business and he ll come in and the team will come in it will be a separate platform reporting into me and having the appropriate connections to our different functional pieces and being supported as they bring cbs into the business we ve already done as i said in my comments we ve already done the first round of cbs training with the leadership team and with some of the key folks in the operational team there and so we feel very good about that we get a ton of experience with that team which is very very important but we ve also got a fair amount of med tech experience in my leadership team and in our boardroom that helps us to have a perspective to bring to the table there as well joseph giordano cowen and company analyst thanks guys operator thank you our next question comes from nathan jones of stifel your line is now open nathan jones stifel nicolaus analyst good morning everyone matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer hey nathan christopher hix senior vice president finance chief financial officer good morning nathan nathan jones stifel nicolaus analyst just back to the air gas orders for a minute looks like you had a really good quarter in the mining business there can you talk about the sustainability of those kind of orders where there s some large project orders in that segment during the fourth quarter that maybe won t repeat matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yeah so first of all the broad view of mining is quite positive the all indications are that the industry is headed into a good healthy multi year period of investment that has started and is very much expected to continue and all the external indicators suggest that as well as our customer funnels and our customer dialog there s no question that that business as it s a smaller part of our overall revenue and that the projects can come in lumps it is a business that quarter to quarter can have a degree of lumpiness to it and that enormous growth rate in the fourth quarter is due to a larger project that came in now that large project to the mining business was a significant outlier at the howden level it s not maybe half of the growth that we had or something like that so even without that large project we were in a pretty healthy growth range there in howden and the last thing i should say about mining is that the large project in mining tend to be direct with the mine or if they are through other parties there is a very strong direct link with the mine and based on that we ve been able to on the recent project as well as others over time been able to value sell and get margins for those large projects to make them attractive recently and on a go forward basis nathan jones stifel nicolaus analyst okay so it sounds like there was some large project in there but the anticipation is that there may be more coming in the future and we also locked them from a margin perspective matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yeah that s correct we expect multiple years of growth in any given quarter or year there could be some one off impacts nathan jones stifel nicolaus analyst okay fair enough on fabtech you guys have had this mid teens margin target out there i think 12 months ago it was three to four years and we re 12 months further along now so we have had some fairly significant changes 50 basis points of margin drag from price cost with the big steel inflation is that target still in that timeframe two to three years from now you should be at that 15 target are there things that have happened that changed the outlook on that business at least from a timing perspective or any color you can give us on when you would anticipate being able to get to that mid teens target now matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yeah sure so we still remain very committed to that target and don t see it as some theoretical future target versus one that we ll be closing in on here in the next couple of years if you look at our last handful of years we ve shown 50 plus basis points of improvement a year and last year the underlying improvement was there it just got consumed by this pass through if you look at our guidance we ve guided to more than 50 basis points of improvement for 2019 which would get us well into the 12s and so whether the path from 19 forward is a couple of years to get to 2015 ph or something slightly different than that i think that s something we ll continue to communicate very transparently especially as we get into our investor day later this year but we see good opportunity to keep expanding margins there between some net price continue to drive productivity some ongoing strategic structural moves in the supply chain in the business the positive impact of the innovation that we ve done in the business there and then getting some leverage from growth as we get and stay in more of a volume growth environment here for a bit getting some leverage out of that growth we still see a clear path to that 15 operating margins nathan jones stifel nicolaus analyst thanks one just one quick one for chris on the cash flow you talked about 69 million from fluid handling last year that wasn t in the cash flow numbers this year do you have a number handy on what the acquisitions that you ve made this year contributed to that cash flow christopher hix senior vice president finance chief financial officer nathan i don t have those numbers at hand you can see that the acquisitions weren t significant in the overall scheme of colfax but each of those should have brought contributing cash flow to the company but i don t have that number at hand nathan jones stifel nicolaus analyst okay fair enough i ll pass it on thanks very much operator thank you our next question comes from julian mitchell of barclays your line is now open julian mitchell barclays analyst hi good morning maybe just another question on the free cash flow conversion to adjusted net income was i think in the 50s percentage wise in 2018 so very low level you talked on the last call about maybe some restructuring charges falling in 19 that helps the conversion step up now that the full 2018 numbers are out there maybe help us a little bit more with the bridge on how the free cash flow steps up and what kind of conversion rate we should expect this year and also then when you are thinking about pro forma colfax ex air and gas including djo what level of free cash conversion should investors expect at that point christopher hix senior vice president finance chief financial officer so let me give you a couple of points of reference there and then again i think what i ll suggest is that we ll come back to you after we close the djo acquisition and we ll talk more about that particular business and any expectations it has on our 2019 performance which should be very additive from a cash flow perspective what we ve commented on is going from 2018 to 2019 we do expect to have significantly lower restructuring spending so year over year that s a 20 million to 30 million benefit and then we ve also talked about lower pension funding as well by 20 million to 30 million so those are two pieces in and of themselves that should be additive to free cash flows as you pivot it from 2018 to 2019 although i m not prepared to go into detail on the djo until we actually close in on the business and therefore can speak to the timing specific timing within the year of its contributions it does have a very attractive free cash flow generation and it comes with the nols that we should not really be a us taxpayer in 2019 and for several years beyond so those are a couple of pieces there that should help us to continue to drive free cash flow conversion higher and get us to significant growth in operating cash flows julian mitchell barclays analyst got it so the free cash flow this year in 19 ex djo we should expect that to be closer to what 80 plus is that a right sort of level christopher hix senior vice president finance chief financial officer yeah i think that for us it s probably healthy to think about that number and as before djo and all the financing impacts and everything on a legacy basis i think we re just over 150 million and our expectation is we can take that up closer to 200 million plus or minus julian mitchell barclays analyst thank you very much and then my follow up second question would really be around you ve mentioned productivity as a profit driver several times in both businesses maybe just help us understand what was the total productivity savings tailwind to your ebit in 2018 and what do you think that will be in 2019 and any color on the fabtech specifically in that regard christopher hix senior vice president finance chief financial officer okay so productivity for us is a combination of the ongoing day to day actions that we drive with continuous improvement in cbs and then i would contrast that with restructuring actions that we ve taken which are more episodic and more structural in nature we ve identified for next year is 2019 i should say this year is the 20 million of benefits from restructuring in the fabrication technology business and 25 million in the air and gas handling business so we do have the structural improvements that will continue into 2019 for these businesses but then in all of our businesses we drive the day to day productivity with an objective that we at least cover inflation or drive beyond inflation and that comes from just hundreds or thousands of actions going on across the business and as we continuously improve the operations julian mitchell barclays analyst thanks and what was the realized restructuring benefit in 2018 matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer about 40 37 million i think julian mitchell barclays analyst great thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from walter liptak of seaport global your line is now open walter liptak seaport global analyst hi thanks good morning matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer hey walt good morning walter liptak seaport global analyst just wanted to ask you a couple of follow ons on the fabtech business and just to clarifying things the restructuring benefits are those done in 2019 or is that what i heard you say or is there some more restructuring benefits that come through in 2020 that help you get to that 15 margin goal christopher hix senior vice president finance chief financial officer beyond 2019 yes so we shared that 2019 i think there is a little bit of ongoing restructuring opportunity in that business part of it is just the legacy supply chain that we ve got and the opportunity to keep making that more strategic but also as we bring in new acquisitions as we have sometimes those bring some new opportunities and we drive the synergy opportunities there and so our view is that that business likely we will have continue to have a little bit of ongoing restructuring on into 20 and even 21 that is just smaller but just the appropriate ongoing strategic step to be doing in that business walter liptak seaport global analyst okay and then just sticking with fabtech the eu exposure for you guys considering auto in industrial i wonder if you can talk about maybe a mid single digit growth number and first half growth assumptions versus second half or should we just think about mid single digits for the full year matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yes to your question about europe i mean there s no question the last few years europe has hung around been a little in the positive from a volume standpoint higher on a revenue standpoint at times but it s not been it s been different countries and different quarters and depending on what s going on in the different industries over there and other things and we expect europe to stay in that range of being a little bit in the positive from a volume standpoint a little higher than that from a revenue standpoint given some of the price and certainly some markets like auto in germany feeling a little bit of pressure but some markets like some of the oil and gas stuff starting to wake up a little bit more and so there is an offsetting effect there as far as the growth through the year we definitely as we said the second half of last year was quite strong there and part of that was a very strong price impact on top of the volume and there was some real strength in our automation business there down the stretch of last year in terms of specific projects flowing through and so as we roll over into 18 that mid single digits is a good indicator from a core growth standpoint as to how we expect to grow the business and certainly the extra growth from automation and some of the price impacts will subside a little bit as we move into the first and second quarter but we still should be solidly in that mid single digit range walter liptak seaport global analyst okay great and then just a last one on corporate expense without djo what are you thinking about for that and should we expect extra expenses related to transactions et cetera christopher hix senior vice president finance chief financial officer so we would expect corporate expenses to be roughly in line with 2018 levels as you go into 2019 there ll be some puts and takes as you suggest as we re integrating djo and some of the cost related to the potential divestiture of the howden business and so forth but largely i d say largely in line walter liptak seaport global analyst okay great thank you operator thank you our next question comes from seth weber of rbc capital markets your line is now open seth weber rbc capital markets analyst hi good morning guys i actually wanted to also ask about the i wanted to ask about the automation business specifically you kind of just touched on it but as it sounds like you may be decelerating here or the comps are maybe just getting harder i mean can you just comment is that do you feel like customers are more reluctant to do bigger ticket projects as this or make bigger ticket investments at this point or is it just you feel like you saw some big growth there and comps are just more difficult and that s why you don t think automation momentum will continue next year thanks matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yeah i want to be clear we still see healthy growth in automation based on the drive to productivity the need for productivity solutions in the industry and we see a healthy funnel there and a healthy backlog it s really more that it is there is a little more project based nature to that business and so in some quarters it s a bigger contributor than others and down the stretch last year we got some extra boost there and we expect it to continue to to contribute to growth nicely here in 2019 as well we re just don t necessarily seeing that extra boost as we enter the year seth weber rbc capital markets analyst okay so you don t feel like customer tone toward bigger ticket capex has changed is what i m trying to figure out matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer no we have not seen any meaningful change in customer tone to bigger ticket capex at this point seth weber rbc capital markets analyst okay thanks and then i just wanted to clarify the puts and takes around this facility sale i think you said 11 million benefit and was that essentially fully offset by these non routine items and can you just give us some granularity on what i think there were three buckets there can you give us any numbers around those three buckets christopher hix senior vice president finance chief financial officer sure yes the 11 million net benefit that we referred to was completely offset by the items that we mentioned the largest of which was a bit over a half came from the some of the work that we ve done on inventory as you can see we ve been continuing to drive working capital turns up and installing cbs at greater levels throughout the organization and as you dig deeper and deeper you find things that you want to make hard decisions on and reduce muda ph and drive efficiency and that certainly drove us to make some decisions in the quarter and move on and clean up some things from a process perspective i d say the other pieces are roughly half and half between a distributor large distributor that we had in emerging market region that we felt it was prudent to take a reserve against some of the receivables as we work through financial issues with that distributor and continue to keep the momentum that we have in the marketplace there and then lastly the hyperinflation that we ve had with argentina that has largely wrapped up now and behind us so those are the principal pieces seth weber rbc capital markets analyst okay very helpful thank you very much guys matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer thanks operator thank you our next question comes from andrew obin of bank of america merrill lynch your line is now open andrew obin bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey good morning guys matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer hey andrew christopher hix senior vice president finance chief financial officer hi andrew andrew obin bank of america merrill lynch analyst just a question on pricing for fabtech how should we think about it for 19 would you have to give any of it back with commodity prices heading down matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yeah andrew certainly what has happened in this market in the past is that when commodity prices go down some of that is passed through automatically contractually and the rest tends to pass through over a little bit of time and historically the producers have been able to hold on a little bit of that just like on the way up you have to play a little catch up on the way down maybe you get a little bit of the benefit but it doesn t sustain and so we re not planning on any significant margin contribution from steel dropping we are counting on some net price just from using that muscle that we ve got to continue to drive thoughtful value based price improvements in the business andrew obin bank of america merrill lynch analyst and just a follow up question you guys have unique insights into emerging markets just because you have more exposure than others could you give us some more detailed view on sort of china russia brazil would greatly be appreciated thank you matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yes sure so let me start with china which is we certainly have seen the some of the industrial slowing that s been talked about quite a bit but both of our businesses actually are kind of balanced across stuff that is kind of pure industrial and things that are little more infrastructure related and whether it s direct infrastructure like investments in rail or tunnel by the government or kind of indirect infrastructure spending where the government is driving environmental programs that then require companies to invest and so what we re seeing is a little bit of a shift to infrastructure as a driver more than just industrial growth as a driver but still the growth holding up ok in china and even industrial growth is going to be at a lower level over there but all indications are that there will still be a pretty decent amount of industrial growth if we move to russia that s an area where we ve had a lot of success over time in our businesses we ve got very strong positions there is no question that that s a country that last year things got challenging with the sanctions environment over there and that affected the russian market and continues to have an impact on the russian market i think we felt a lot of that last year and so that s going to continue this year and we think at some point turn in the right direction but that s a market that we see kind of going sideways at this point in time and then brazil we re feeling quite good about it we think the election over there and some of the trends that the local belief is that as we work through 2019 here that brazil is going to move in a good healthy positive direction and we ll see what the timing of that is and we re doing some good proactive things in the country to make sure that we re set up to take advantage of that andrew obin bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks so much operator thank you our next question comes from matt trusz of g research your line is now open matt trusz g research analyst good morning thank you for taking my question matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer hi matt matt trusz g research analyst so follow up question on fabtech when we think about the equipment versus consumables mix which has continued to grind higher for about two years now i m wondering how do you interpret this is it reflecting you think increased equipment market share the benefit of accelerated depreciation and changing customer behavior or is there something else going on or just natural mix of ph demand thanks matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer for us if i just think about the equipment versus consumables growth rates i would say the consumer growth rates have tended to be a little higher based on the price that s being passed through the volume growth in consumables is probably the same or lower than the equipment but the price impact is the most there on the equipment side the automation growth comes on that side and certainly is pulling the growth up there and leading to more growth and more of a piece on equipment and then certainly some of the acquisitions that we ve done we ve acquired more business on the equipment front than we have on the consumables front and so that s had an impact on our business as well matt trusz g research analyst thank you and then just on air gas did the structural changes you re making as you pivot to general industrial open up any path to maybe exceeding mid high teens ebit or i guess mid teens ebit especially given what s some peers achieve or do you view that more as the tools to achieve that initial mid teens target thank you matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yes surely clearly with both of our businesses our view has been for a number of years that we have a strategic goal of getting to that mid teens target and we ve got execution plans for how to get there and we re executing them and i think that s the case in both businesses that we ve got credible execution plans to how to get the rest of the way from where we are now to mid teens we have also in both businesses been strategically thinking about and working on ok once you get there how do you go forward and certainly the structural improvements to the air and gas handling business with the industrial acquisition adds we brought there and as well as some of the stuff we ve done organically create a more credible path to get not only to that 15 but to be thinking about how to get beyond that but we re going to focus on getting there first and meanwhile we ll work on the plans for how we get further operator thank you and at this time there are no further questions i would like to hand the call back over to kevin johnson for any closing remarks kevin

slide 3 matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer thanks kevin and good morning 2018 has been a transformational year for colfax during which we reshaped our company and established an even stronger foundation for our future first we finished the year with strong financial results including earnings growth of 33 placing us well ahead of the commitment we made in december of 2017 esab achieved strong and accelerating sales growth across all regions including strong contributions from new products and the team has done a great job of protecting margins in a year of notable cost escalation our howden business recovered from the market challenges of late 2017 and the team has gotten the business firmly back on a path to mid teen segment margins they ve successfully grown sales in the faster growing industrial applications which are now half of the business and howden exits 2018 with strong momentum on both order growth and margins and is well placed for a strong performance in 2019 we ve successfully driven restructuring actions within both of our businesses and delivered 37 million of restructuring cost savings our progress improving the vitality of both businesses shows the power of cbs and supports our margin and growth improvement we completed the monetization of our fluid handling business at an attractive multiple of over 13 times ebitda and completed four new bolt on acquisitions that strengthen and diversify our esab and howden businesses we also announced that colfax has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire djo a leading global orthopedic solutions company this acquisition is consistent with our strategy to create a higher margin faster growing and less cyclical company to support our deleveraging plans and future growth investments we re exploring strategic options for our air and gas handling business including a potential sale we believe this will be a very attractive asset to potential acquirers given all the progress made to strengthen and diversify the business moving to slide 4 you can see the highlights from our fourth quarter results our operating performance was in line with expectations and tax benefits contributed to outperformance fabrication technology achieved strong sales growth from continued healthy market demand as well as new product launches and pricing actions completed throughout the year air and gas handling drove another quarter of double digit order growth with industrial remaining very strong aftermarket accelerating and most end use markets moving in a positive direction we increased this business margins through restructuring actions and a deeper application of our business system to improve operational execution this month we successfully completed the djo acquisition financing that started in the fourth quarter djo is a global leader in the attractive growing orthopedic solutions market and we re excited about the potential to apply our business system to further improve the business growth and profitability on slide 5 you can see esab continued growth and continued growth trajectory this was the eighth quarter in a row of core growth at esab and we continue to show double digit growth both overall and core while healthy margins around the world have been a positive factor in our growth we also launched 11 new products in 2018 increased our automation backlog and funnel and added some great acquisitions sandvik and gce that are performing well i was in europe recently with the gce team for our standard 100 day review process we already have a fast start there thoughtfully integrating our businesses in the welding market and identifying some exciting gas control growth plans in med tech and life sciences during the quarter we had some translational currency headwinds from the strengthening usd predominantly in our argentinian brazilian and russian businesses on slide 6 you can see esab s year to date and current quarter year over year adjusted operating profit performance the performance was in line with what i communicated on our outlook call in december margins of 11 6 excluding the october 2018 gce acquisition finished the year in line with 2017 now as i ve talked about on several calls now we had multiple sources of cost escalation during 2018 year to date pricing actions have delivered nearly 5 points of price to offset material and other inflation pressures and as these price actions are only covering inflation the business margin rates are being compressed by about 50 basis points both year to date and in the fourth quarter absent this pressure we would ve had another year of solid margin expansion in this business when we exclude the gce acquisition from q4 underlying adjusted operating margins were 11 2 this is a solid step forward from q3 and our team continued to execute price and productivity actions in q4 to enter 2019 firmly on the right side of the 2018 price cost improvement curve esab s margins are expected to take a step forward in 2019 as additional price and productivity actions flow through and the business has a clear path back to greater than 12 operating margins in the first half of 2019 the healthy margin expansion in our 2019 guidance is consistent with the our path to mid teens for this business slide 7 shows our continued progress reshaping air and gas handling business for less cyclical more profitable growth in the fourth quarter the business had 13 core order growth plus another couple of points from the recent aci and ach acquisitions we continue to achieve strong growth in our strategic industrial applications as core industrial orders grew 18 in the quarter oil and gas orders grew sequentially and the profitability of new orders continues to improve mining orders grew organically 141 as we secured a large order in the quarter at good margin levels finally our power markets remained stable and orders as expected stepped up sequentially in the fourth quarter on slide 8 the air and gas handling segment core sales grew 11 in the quarter supported by strong growth in industrial applications and as expected howden performed strongly on margins in the fourth quarter which improved 230 basis points sequentially and 440 basis points year over year to 12 1 this improvement came from price productivity restructuring and strategic choices that we ve made in oil and gas to focus on higher margin projects backlog ended the year a bit stronger than expected and both backlog size and margin levels support the guidance provided on our december outlook call on slide 9 i want to share with you how the colfax business system helped us to drive margin improvement in howden lead process improvement is often thought of as synonymous with manufacturing but cbs is a holistic business system that helps us to continuously improve across all business activities policy deployment is the core tool in the cbs tool kit and arguably our most powerful tool its purpose is to drive breakthrough change within our businesses to advance our strategies a great example of the impact of policy deployment can be found in the improvement in howden project management during 2018 in 2017 the howden leadership team had identified the opportunity to drive improvements in project execution on large newbuild projects which involve complex engineering solutions and teams around the world using policy deployment the howden team reengineered their end to end project management processes and built a stronger foundation for project execution this resulted in 2018 improvements in milestone delivery higher margins and better working capital these changes are now sustained standard work in the business this is a great example of how our teams use cbs to deliver improved service to customers and improve financial results on slide 10 we provide an update on our strategic initiatives the company recently completed the financing to support the acquisition of djo and refinance existing bank loans chris and his teams did a great job of getting this completed quickly and at attractive terms the djo acquisition is progressing as expected we completed regulatory filings and continue to target a q1 close our experienced integration team is fully engaged and we re all working closely with the djo team to ensure a smooth transition i was with the senior djo team in dallas recently for their initial cbs training and both sides are excited about the opportunities ahead the review of our air and gas handling strategic options is well under way goldman sachs and barclays are leading the efforts and we re moving with speed before i hand over to chris i want to comment on our strategic progress we ve strengthened our esab and howden businesses getting them on to solid path to growth and mid teens segment margins the recent djo new platform acquisition is entirely consistent with our strategic commitment to diversify and strengthen our portfolio we also see exciting opportunities to further expand in med tech in summary we made a lot of strategic and operational progress in 2018 and i expect a very successful year for colfax in 2019 now i d like to hand it over to chris who will discuss the financial results christopher hix senior vice president finance chief financial officer thank you matt on slide 11 you can see company sales grew 13 in the third quarter to 985 million reflecting a 11 organic growth and 7 from acquisitions mostly gce that was acquired in october of 2018 but also sandvik that was acquired earlier in the year we also faced a 5 currency translation headwind in the quarter from a stronger us dollar mostly compared with the argentine peso brazilian real and the russian ruble we grew gross profit by 36 million in the quarter and gross margin by 20 basis points due to continued growth at our fabtech business and very strong air and gas handling operating performance as matt mentioned earlier some of our margin progress has been obscured by the effect of using price to effectively offset inflation which grossed up esab s revenue and cost of goods sold and compressed its reported operating margins by 50 basis points and 20 basis points for colfax overall despite year over year fx translation pressure of nearly 5 million operating profit increased 23 million or 27 million excluding 4 million of one time transaction costs and inventory step up charges from the recent gce acquisition adjusted margins increased 150 basis points to 9 4 or 180 basis points to 9 7 before one time transaction costs and inventory step up charges during the quarter we sold an old esab facility as part of an ongoing colfaxwide program that has included six facilities over the past four years for total cumulative proceeds of about 43 million applying cbs drives productivity improvements that frees up capacity and enables footprint rationalization and higher efficiencies the net benefit of 11 million we recognized in the quarter from the facility sale was offset by non routine charges resulting from argentina hyperinflation receivable reserves for distributor and the impact of strengthening inventory standard work and processes below the line continued focus from our tax team contributed to this quarter s results as we drove the rate down to 17 overall q4 operating performance was in line with our expectations and a lower than projected tax rate contributed to the 53 increase in eps in the quarter slide 12 shows our progress on cash flow performance fourth quarter operating cash flow was 126 million versus 104 million last year with the improvement coming mostly from higher profitability this higher cash flow was delivered despite the significant growth at esab that required working capital investment the 7 million year over year increase in full year operating cash flow to 226 million does not tell the whole story the prior year results included 69 million of cash flow generated in the fluid handling business that we divested in december 2017 so the real improvement was 76 million on a consistent basis and we expect to make another healthy step forward in 2019 i ll finish my remarks on slide 13 by reaffirming the outlook we provided in december we started the new year with january results that were consistent with our expectations for the full year we continue to expect our fabrication technology business to grow high single digits including a full year contribution from the gce business we are forecasting stable material costs and the price increases over the past several quarters are expected to lap core growth is forecasted to be mid single digits about half price and half volume with operating margins exceeding 12 on the strength of restructuring and pricing actions including the rollover benefit from initiatives completed in 2018 and further productivity savings our air and gas handling business is expected to grow orders this year mid to high single digits led by continued growth in industrial applications and strengthening mining markets we continue to expect core growth to be flat plus or minus with continued margin growth from restructuring improved customer project execution and aftermarket initiatives after the djo acquisition is completed we will provide an update for our expectations for this year we continue to expect a strong year of profit growth in our existing businesses with adjusted operating profit growth of 20 or more that concludes our prepared remarks please open up the call for questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from mike halloran of baird your line is now open mike halloran robert w baird co analyst hey good morning everyone matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer how are you doing ph mike mike halloran robert w baird co analyst could you just talk a little bit about the underlying trends you re seeing on the fab tech side it certainly sounds like some consistency still despite all the headline noise globally but maybe a few more thoughts on the trajectory through the quarter into the first quarter so far any regional variances anything by product category that s interesting or showing particular strength or particular weakness as you look to the quarter matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yeah sure mike so obviously the back half last year was good and strong but that s kind of half and half growth between price and volume growth and some of the strongest parts down the stretch last year where north america as well as growth in automation in the business as we roll over into this year you can see in our guidance that we are still forecasting to have healthy growth in the business but lower than that double digit second half more of a mid single digits year this year and we re still seeing growth broad based growth but we do see expect to see the north america growth come down a little from from that higher spot that it went to last year and different places in the world a little to and fro here in the different emerging markets in the world mike halloran robert w baird co analyst out of curiosity are you seeing actual weakness on that growth are you just more or less referring to normal sequential patterns from what we re seeing here cumulatively and comparisons getting a little harder driving the deceleration matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yeah we re seeing we re seeing what we expect to see here in the fourth quarter in terms of some tougher comps and kind of a normal sequential patterns consistent with the guidance that we ve given mike halloran robert w baird co analyst okay sounds good there and then just a question on the price cost side as you work through the year fabtech same ph maybe just talk about the price cost curve in the fourth quarter and how you expect the cadence through the year with the moving parts with your pricing gains as well as the commodity swings we ve seen matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yeah sure well as i said in my remarks we passed through almost 100 million of price last year that 5 a little over 100 million that 5 number and that was throughout the year we cleared the air kind of on the right side of the equation there versus steel but definitely down the stretch in the air ph there were broader set of inflationary pressures that had us having to continue to drive price there in the third quarter and the fourth quarter even beyond just the steel impact and so as we roll over into the first half of this year we expect to be able to see nice sequential margin improvement in the business as those price actions continue to flow through and the productivity actions continue to flows through we see the steel environment has stabilized and so that provides an opportunity to limit the price actions to the other inflationary pressures in the business and to use some of the muscle that was created last year to get some net price in some of the key parts of the product line where there is a value based opportunity to drive net price improvement in the business mike halloran robert w baird co analyst appreciate the color matt thanks matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer thanks operator thank you our next question comes from jeff hammond of keybanc capital markets your line is now open jeff hammond keybanc capital markets analyst hi good morning gentlemen matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer good morning jeff christopher hix senior vice president finance chief financial officer hi jeff jeff hammond keybanc capital markets analyst so just to follow on on that the price cost like the 50 basis point headwind is that how do you see that kind of shaping up in 1q and kind of the cadence through the year just is all the gce acquisition noise kind of behind you matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yeah so the kind of mathematical price pressure of passing through price was kind of increased throughout last year but was consistent through most of last year and so i think we ll start to lap that we ll have a little bit of it in the first quarter as we move through the price absent more steel we will start to lap that mathematical impact of the price cost i think in terms of the earnings impact of the price cost we re entering q1 on the right side of that and expect to not have a price cost earnings drag and as we move through the year to have a little bit of benefit there and then gce certainly the biggest effect from the gce acquisition was in the fourth quarter based on when it came in and some of the early things that we do in acquisitions and we will have still a little bit of a drag from some of those early charges and things in the first and second quarter here but it will be much smaller than the fourth quarter jeff hammond keybanc capital markets analyst okay great and then matt you said you re moving with speed in air and gas process can you just talk about interest levels at this point and what you think best guess on timing is matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yeah we are really not going to comment on the specifics of the process we ve done all the right things to move into that process with speed and excellence and we ve got the business on a good healthy improving path and so we feel confident in our ability to drive to good outcome there but we re going to share information at the point that we think is appropriate to share it jeff hammond keybanc capital markets analyst okay and then just one housekeeping how should we think about tax rate for 19 with and without djo christopher hix senior vice president finance chief financial officer i ll speak to the tax rate without djo and then of course we will provide a bigger update once we ve closed the djo acquisition and we ll come back to the folks with a different sort of outlook without djo we re continuing to believe that the go forward sustainable tax rate for 2019 will be in the low sort of low 20s if you look back over time you can see that we ve driven the rate from that kind of low 30s high 20s down into the low 20s and we ve also taken advantage of other initiatives to drive the rate tactically down below 20 but on a sustainable basis right now we believe low 20s is the way to think about it jeff hammond keybanc capital markets analyst okay perfect thanks chris operator thank you our next question comes from andy kaplowitz of citi your line is now open brad citi research analyst good morning guys it s brad speaking ph on for andy matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer hi good morning brad citi research analyst so in fabtech you noted the new product has a contributed growth there and you ve obviously been very focused on reinvigorating the product portfolio there over the past couple of years can you give us some color maybe on how much the new products contributed to growth in 2019 ph and how you re thinking about new products as a contributor to growth in 19 and beyond matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yeah we definitely have made a lot of progress on that business on vitality and the amount of revenue coming from new products and that s helping our growth it s helping our brand and it is at this point broad based across the portfolio a few years back it was more concentrated on our equipment product line and we ve now got it more broad based across the portfolio our view is that the path to strong growth performance over time in that industry is that fresh products new products can get you a couple of points of growth that you wouldn t have if you didn t have fresh and newer products and so that s kind of how we view the path to consistently drive an industry plus growth is to have those good fresh and new products obviously the revenue contribution from them is larger than that but in terms of how much it differentiates your growth in any given point in time we think it s in that kind of a range brad citi research analyst okay that s great and then maybe just shifting to air and gas handling you had nice year over year growth in general industrial orders in the business really every quarter this year and we know that s been a big focus area for you can you talk about your visibility to sustaining continued momentum in general industrial growth within air and gas handling matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yes we have sustained the momentum there for quite some time now and we still have healthy funnels and ongoing initiatives across a broad set of industrial segments so we think the market environment supports ongoing industrial growth we see the momentum of our initiatives supporting continued growth there there s no question that like the rest of the business there is parts of it that are more project based and in a given point in time you might have a little more or a little less based on kind of which projects are coming when but between the broad based nature of the growth there and the external environment as well as our initiative based momentum we see the potential to continue that industrial growth in the business brad citi research analyst okay thanks guys i will get back in queue operator thank you our next question comes from joe giordano of cowen your line is now open joseph giordano cowen and company analyst hi guys good morning christopher hix senior vice president finance chief financial officer good morning joe matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer good morning joseph giordano cowen and company analyst so on your oil and gas orders i know the last couple of quarters matt you mentioned that there s been a lot of business out there and you ve kind of made a conscious decision to not pursue it because of the margins inherent there so you re seeing a little bit of sequential expansion in the order book there has the market strengthened there has there been any change or is it kind of an opportunistic project win how would you categorize that kind of progress matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer we see the oil and gas market has been gradually moving in a positive direction overall but if i start from our aftermarket presence in that market which is more with refineries than anything else that s been on a good improving path there and both the ongoing aftermarket and even some of the retrofit kind of projects there have been coming through and then second the part that we re strategically focused on now and going forward in terms of some of the kind of small to medium sized project based new project based opportunity there there are healthy funnels there s been some decent project flow it s still as it s been in the past few years it still continues to be real kind of start stop versus kind of a strong increasing trend but it s moving in the right direction and the funnels continue to build there in that business joseph giordano cowen and company analyst okay and then maybe last for me i feel like there s a lot of investor talk about djo and just familiarity with you guys in that type of business can you maybe discuss at a high level i know you re not going into detail yet but how does that business like what s the management structure how does that roll up to you can you talk about your how your past experiences with similar businesses give you comfort that in how you guys can run that business effectively matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yes sure i would say strategically we see that as a great add to our company that really moves us forward in a terrific way and that we ll be able to apply our compounding strategy into as it comes in brady shirley will lead the business he s got over 20 years in that orthopedic solutions industry he has been in the business for about four years led the implant business for a few years and did a great job getting that on a strong growth path and then he has led the overall business and he ll come in and the team will come in it will be a separate platform reporting into me and having the appropriate connections to our different functional pieces and being supported as they bring cbs into the business we ve already done as i said in my comments we ve already done the first round of cbs training with the leadership team and with some of the key folks in the operational team there and so we feel very good about that we get a ton of experience with that team which is very very important but we ve also got a fair amount of med tech experience in my leadership team and in our boardroom that helps us to have a perspective to bring to the table there as well joseph giordano cowen and company analyst thanks guys operator thank you our next question comes from nathan jones of stifel your line is now open nathan jones stifel nicolaus analyst good morning everyone matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer hey nathan christopher hix senior vice president finance chief financial officer good morning nathan nathan jones stifel nicolaus analyst just back to the air gas orders for a minute looks like you had a really good quarter in the mining business there can you talk about the sustainability of those kind of orders where there s some large project orders in that segment during the fourth quarter that maybe won t repeat matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yeah so first of all the broad view of mining is quite positive the all indications are that the industry is headed into a good healthy multi year period of investment that has started and is very much expected to continue and all the external indicators suggest that as well as our customer funnels and our customer dialog there s no question that that business as it s a smaller part of our overall revenue and that the projects can come in lumps it is a business that quarter to quarter can have a degree of lumpiness to it and that enormous growth rate in the fourth quarter is due to a larger project that came in now that large project to the mining business was a significant outlier at the howden level it s not maybe half of the growth that we had or something like that so even without that large project we were in a pretty healthy growth range there in howden and the last thing i should say about mining is that the large project in mining tend to be direct with the mine or if they are through other parties there is a very strong direct link with the mine and based on that we ve been able to on the recent project as well as others over time been able to value sell and get margins for those large projects to make them attractive recently and on a go forward basis nathan jones stifel nicolaus analyst okay so it sounds like there was some large project in there but the anticipation is that there may be more coming in the future and we also locked them from a margin perspective matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yeah that s correct we expect multiple years of growth in any given quarter or year there could be some one off impacts nathan jones stifel nicolaus analyst okay fair enough on fabtech you guys have had this mid teens margin target out there i think 12 months ago it was three to four years and we re 12 months further along now so we have had some fairly significant changes 50 basis points of margin drag from price cost with the big steel inflation is that target still in that timeframe two to three years from now you should be at that 15 target are there things that have happened that changed the outlook on that business at least from a timing perspective or any color you can give us on when you would anticipate being able to get to that mid teens target now matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yeah sure so we still remain very committed to that target and don t see it as some theoretical future target versus one that we ll be closing in on here in the next couple of years if you look at our last handful of years we ve shown 50 plus basis points of improvement a year and last year the underlying improvement was there it just got consumed by this pass through if you look at our guidance we ve guided to more than 50 basis points of improvement for 2019 which would get us well into the 12s and so whether the path from 19 forward is a couple of years to get to 2015 ph or something slightly different than that i think that s something we ll continue to communicate very transparently especially as we get into our investor day later this year but we see good opportunity to keep expanding margins there between some net price continue to drive productivity some ongoing strategic structural moves in the supply chain in the business the positive impact of the innovation that we ve done in the business there and then getting some leverage from growth as we get and stay in more of a volume growth environment here for a bit getting some leverage out of that growth we still see a clear path to that 15 operating margins nathan jones stifel nicolaus analyst thanks one just one quick one for chris on the cash flow you talked about 69 million from fluid handling last year that wasn t in the cash flow numbers this year do you have a number handy on what the acquisitions that you ve made this year contributed to that cash flow christopher hix senior vice president finance chief financial officer nathan i don t have those numbers at hand you can see that the acquisitions weren t significant in the overall scheme of colfax but each of those should have brought contributing cash flow to the company but i don t have that number at hand nathan jones stifel nicolaus analyst okay fair enough i ll pass it on thanks very much operator thank you our next question comes from julian mitchell of barclays your line is now open julian mitchell barclays analyst hi good morning maybe just another question on the free cash flow conversion to adjusted net income was i think in the 50s percentage wise in 2018 so very low level you talked on the last call about maybe some restructuring charges falling in 19 that helps the conversion step up now that the full 2018 numbers are out there maybe help us a little bit more with the bridge on how the free cash flow steps up and what kind of conversion rate we should expect this year and also then when you are thinking about pro forma colfax ex air and gas including djo what level of free cash conversion should investors expect at that point christopher hix senior vice president finance chief financial officer so let me give you a couple of points of reference there and then again i think what i ll suggest is that we ll come back to you after we close the djo acquisition and we ll talk more about that particular business and any expectations it has on our 2019 performance which should be very additive from a cash flow perspective what we ve commented on is going from 2018 to 2019 we do expect to have significantly lower restructuring spending so year over year that s a 20 million to 30 million benefit and then we ve also talked about lower pension funding as well by 20 million to 30 million so those are two pieces in and of themselves that should be additive to free cash flows as you pivot it from 2018 to 2019 although i m not prepared to go into detail on the djo until we actually close in on the business and therefore can speak to the timing specific timing within the year of its contributions it does have a very attractive free cash flow generation and it comes with the nols that we should not really be a us taxpayer in 2019 and for several years beyond so those are a couple of pieces there that should help us to continue to drive free cash flow conversion higher and get us to significant growth in operating cash flows julian mitchell barclays analyst got it so the free cash flow this year in 19 ex djo we should expect that to be closer to what 80 plus is that a right sort of level christopher hix senior vice president finance chief financial officer yeah i think that for us it s probably healthy to think about that number and as before djo and all the financing impacts and everything on a legacy basis i think we re just over 150 million and our expectation is we can take that up closer to 200 million plus or minus julian mitchell barclays analyst thank you very much and then my follow up second question would really be around you ve mentioned productivity as a profit driver several times in both businesses maybe just help us understand what was the total productivity savings tailwind to your ebit in 2018 and what do you think that will be in 2019 and any color on the fabtech specifically in that regard christopher hix senior vice president finance chief financial officer okay so productivity for us is a combination of the ongoing day to day actions that we drive with continuous improvement in cbs and then i would contrast that with restructuring actions that we ve taken which are more episodic and more structural in nature we ve identified for next year is 2019 i should say this year is the 20 million of benefits from restructuring in the fabrication technology business and 25 million in the air and gas handling business so we do have the structural improvements that will continue into 2019 for these businesses but then in all of our businesses we drive the day to day productivity with an objective that we at least cover inflation or drive beyond inflation and that comes from just hundreds or thousands of actions going on across the business and as we continuously improve the operations julian mitchell barclays analyst thanks and what was the realized restructuring benefit in 2018 matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer about 40 37 million i think julian mitchell barclays analyst great thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from walter liptak of seaport global your line is now open walter liptak seaport global analyst hi thanks good morning matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer hey walt good morning walter liptak seaport global analyst just wanted to ask you a couple of follow ons on the fabtech business and just to clarifying things the restructuring benefits are those done in 2019 or is that what i heard you say or is there some more restructuring benefits that come through in 2020 that help you get to that 15 margin goal christopher hix senior vice president finance chief financial officer beyond 2019 yes so we shared that 2019 i think there is a little bit of ongoing restructuring opportunity in that business part of it is just the legacy supply chain that we ve got and the opportunity to keep making that more strategic but also as we bring in new acquisitions as we have sometimes those bring some new opportunities and we drive the synergy opportunities there and so our view is that that business likely we will have continue to have a little bit of ongoing restructuring on into 20 and even 21 that is just smaller but just the appropriate ongoing strategic step to be doing in that business walter liptak seaport global analyst okay and then just sticking with fabtech the eu exposure for you guys considering auto in industrial i wonder if you can talk about maybe a mid single digit growth number and first half growth assumptions versus second half or should we just think about mid single digits for the full year matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yes to your question about europe i mean there s no question the last few years europe has hung around been a little in the positive from a volume standpoint higher on a revenue standpoint at times but it s not been it s been different countries and different quarters and depending on what s going on in the different industries over there and other things and we expect europe to stay in that range of being a little bit in the positive from a volume standpoint a little higher than that from a revenue standpoint given some of the price and certainly some markets like auto in germany feeling a little bit of pressure but some markets like some of the oil and gas stuff starting to wake up a little bit more and so there is an offsetting effect there as far as the growth through the year we definitely as we said the second half of last year was quite strong there and part of that was a very strong price impact on top of the volume and there was some real strength in our automation business there down the stretch of last year in terms of specific projects flowing through and so as we roll over into 18 that mid single digits is a good indicator from a core growth standpoint as to how we expect to grow the business and certainly the extra growth from automation and some of the price impacts will subside a little bit as we move into the first and second quarter but we still should be solidly in that mid single digit range walter liptak seaport global analyst okay great and then just a last one on corporate expense without djo what are you thinking about for that and should we expect extra expenses related to transactions et cetera christopher hix senior vice president finance chief financial officer so we would expect corporate expenses to be roughly in line with 2018 levels as you go into 2019 there ll be some puts and takes as you suggest as we re integrating djo and some of the cost related to the potential divestiture of the howden business and so forth but largely i d say largely in line walter liptak seaport global analyst okay great thank you operator thank you our next question comes from seth weber of rbc capital markets your line is now open seth weber rbc capital markets analyst hi good morning guys i actually wanted to also ask about the i wanted to ask about the automation business specifically you kind of just touched on it but as it sounds like you may be decelerating here or the comps are maybe just getting harder i mean can you just comment is that do you feel like customers are more reluctant to do bigger ticket projects as this or make bigger ticket investments at this point or is it just you feel like you saw some big growth there and comps are just more difficult and that s why you don t think automation momentum will continue next year thanks matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yeah i want to be clear we still see healthy growth in automation based on the drive to productivity the need for productivity solutions in the industry and we see a healthy funnel there and a healthy backlog it s really more that it is there is a little more project based nature to that business and so in some quarters it s a bigger contributor than others and down the stretch last year we got some extra boost there and we expect it to continue to to contribute to growth nicely here in 2019 as well we re just don t necessarily seeing that extra boost as we enter the year seth weber rbc capital markets analyst okay so you don t feel like customer tone toward bigger ticket capex has changed is what i m trying to figure out matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer no we have not seen any meaningful change in customer tone to bigger ticket capex at this point seth weber rbc capital markets analyst okay thanks and then i just wanted to clarify the puts and takes around this facility sale i think you said 11 million benefit and was that essentially fully offset by these non routine items and can you just give us some granularity on what i think there were three buckets there can you give us any numbers around those three buckets christopher hix senior vice president finance chief financial officer sure yes the 11 million net benefit that we referred to was completely offset by the items that we mentioned the largest of which was a bit over a half came from the some of the work that we ve done on inventory as you can see we ve been continuing to drive working capital turns up and installing cbs at greater levels throughout the organization and as you dig deeper and deeper you find things that you want to make hard decisions on and reduce muda ph and drive efficiency and that certainly drove us to make some decisions in the quarter and move on and clean up some things from a process perspective i d say the other pieces are roughly half and half between a distributor large distributor that we had in emerging market region that we felt it was prudent to take a reserve against some of the receivables as we work through financial issues with that distributor and continue to keep the momentum that we have in the marketplace there and then lastly the hyperinflation that we ve had with argentina that has largely wrapped up now and behind us so those are the principal pieces seth weber rbc capital markets analyst okay very helpful thank you very much guys matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer thanks operator thank you our next question comes from andrew obin of bank of america merrill lynch your line is now open andrew obin bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey good morning guys matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer hey andrew christopher hix senior vice president finance chief financial officer hi andrew andrew obin bank of america merrill lynch analyst just a question on pricing for fabtech how should we think about it for 19 would you have to give any of it back with commodity prices heading down matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yeah andrew certainly what has happened in this market in the past is that when commodity prices go down some of that is passed through automatically contractually and the rest tends to pass through over a little bit of time and historically the producers have been able to hold on a little bit of that just like on the way up you have to play a little catch up on the way down maybe you get a little bit of the benefit but it doesn t sustain and so we re not planning on any significant margin contribution from steel dropping we are counting on some net price just from using that muscle that we ve got to continue to drive thoughtful value based price improvements in the business andrew obin bank of america merrill lynch analyst and just a follow up question you guys have unique insights into emerging markets just because you have more exposure than others could you give us some more detailed view on sort of china russia brazil would greatly be appreciated thank you matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yes sure so let me start with china which is we certainly have seen the some of the industrial slowing that s been talked about quite a bit but both of our businesses actually are kind of balanced across stuff that is kind of pure industrial and things that are little more infrastructure related and whether it s direct infrastructure like investments in rail or tunnel by the government or kind of indirect infrastructure spending where the government is driving environmental programs that then require companies to invest and so what we re seeing is a little bit of a shift to infrastructure as a driver more than just industrial growth as a driver but still the growth holding up ok in china and even industrial growth is going to be at a lower level over there but all indications are that there will still be a pretty decent amount of industrial growth if we move to russia that s an area where we ve had a lot of success over time in our businesses we ve got very strong positions there is no question that that s a country that last year things got challenging with the sanctions environment over there and that affected the russian market and continues to have an impact on the russian market i think we felt a lot of that last year and so that s going to continue this year and we think at some point turn in the right direction but that s a market that we see kind of going sideways at this point in time and then brazil we re feeling quite good about it we think the election over there and some of the trends that the local belief is that as we work through 2019 here that brazil is going to move in a good healthy positive direction and we ll see what the timing of that is and we re doing some good proactive things in the country to make sure that we re set up to take advantage of that andrew obin bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks so much operator thank you our next question comes from matt trusz of g research your line is now open matt trusz g research analyst good morning thank you for taking my question matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer hi matt matt trusz g research analyst so follow up question on fabtech when we think about the equipment versus consumables mix which has continued to grind higher for about two years now i m wondering how do you interpret this is it reflecting you think increased equipment market share the benefit of accelerated depreciation and changing customer behavior or is there something else going on or just natural mix of ph demand thanks matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer for us if i just think about the equipment versus consumables growth rates i would say the consumer growth rates have tended to be a little higher based on the price that s being passed through the volume growth in consumables is probably the same or lower than the equipment but the price impact is the most there on the equipment side the automation growth comes on that side and certainly is pulling the growth up there and leading to more growth and more of a piece on equipment and then certainly some of the acquisitions that we ve done we ve acquired more business on the equipment front than we have on the consumables front and so that s had an impact on our business as well matt trusz g research analyst thank you and then just on air gas did the structural changes you re making as you pivot to general industrial open up any path to maybe exceeding mid high teens ebit or i guess mid teens ebit especially given what s some peers achieve or do you view that more as the tools to achieve that initial mid teens target thank you matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yes surely clearly with both of our businesses our view has been for a number of years that we have a strategic goal of getting to that mid teens target and we ve got execution plans for how to get there and we re executing them and i think that s the case in both businesses that we ve got credible execution plans to how to get the rest of the way from where we are now to mid teens we have also in both businesses been strategically thinking about and working on ok once you get there how do you go forward and certainly the structural improvements to the air and gas handling business with the industrial acquisition adds we brought there and as well as some of the stuff we ve done organically create a more credible path to get not only to that 15 but to be thinking about how to get beyond that but we re going to focus on getting there first and meanwhile we ll work on the plans for how we get further operator thank you and at this time there are no further questions i would like to hand the call back over to kevin johnson for any closing remarks kevin johnson vice president of finance thanks haley thanks everyone for joining us today look forward to speaking to you on the next call operator ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today s conference

the fourth quarter of 2018 was 18 0 million as compared to 38 9 million from the same period last year an incremental 10 0 million of export tax expense an added 5 9 million of stumpage expense and a commodity heavy sales mix more than offset improvements in specialty product price realizations in addition lower commodity lumber pricing drove a negative lumber and log inventory revaluation of 1 9 million as compared to a positive adjustment of 2 5 million in the same period last year operating income prior to restructuring items and other income decreased to 7 7 million from 30 3 million in the same period last year last year we proactively increased western red cedar wrc pricing and shipments in advance of the application of lumber duties and us countervailing lumber duty application was limited to three days in the quarter in contrast the fourth quarter of 2018 saw a return to a more normal seasonal wrc sales cycle and the full application of lumber duties canadian to united states dollar usd exchange rate volatility leading into year end resulted in an unrealized mark to market expense of 2 2 million from outstanding foreign currency forward contracts as compared to a 0 7 million unrealized gain in the fourth quarter of 2017 sales lumber revenue was 230 9 million an increase of 11 from same period last year we grew shipments by 9 and increased realized lumber pricing despite a weaker sales mix and a steep decline in commodity lumber prices specialty lumber sales pricing was supported by a 26 increase in high value wrc timbers to mitigate declining commodity lumber prices we significantly increased direct lumber sales into china as noted above we returned to a more normal seasonal wrc sales cycle which contributed to an 11 decrease in wrc shipments specialty lumber represented 49 of total fourth quarter shipments as compared to 55 in the same period last year fourth quarter log revenue was 36 2 million a 36 decrease from the same period last year improved log pricing was more than offset by a weaker log sales mix log shipments decreased by 25 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 as we temporarily suspended our export log sales program to direct additional logs to our mills the only export log shipment in the period originated from a short term first nation timber purchase agreement managed by western by products revenue was 17 7 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 as compared to 19 2 million in the same period in 2017 pricing remained comparatively flat on lower shipments due to reduced chip volumes purchased for resale operations lumber production was 200 million board feet a 9 increase over the fourth quarter of 2017 despite storm related power outages and capital projects which interrupted production in late december we grew lumber production by leveraging the benefit of our mill capital investments well positioned opening log inventory and the redirection of export logs we significantly increased year over year production at our duke point facility through improved operating efficiencies and higher operating hours in addition we grew finished lumber production from the upgraded planer recent investments in our chemainus timber deck drove a 14 increase in high value wrc timber production over the same period last year fourth quarter manufacturing costs were 3 higher than the same period last year due to increased secondary processing and storm and capital related downtime our natural gas pricing was higher due to a temporary supply disruption log production was 1 135 000 cubic metres an increase of 3 from the fourth quarter of last year we took advantage of improved harvest conditions to make up ground from fire related curtailments in the third quarter increasing closing log inventory by 6 compared to the end of 2017 excluding stumpage expense our harvest costs were consistent with the fourth quarter of 2017 stumpage expense increased by 75 as a result of provincial rate equation updates the ongoing influence of coastal log exports and higher market log pricing despite weaker lumber markets saw log purchases were 212 000 cubic metres a 38 decrease from the same quarter last year increased demand from export markets and pulp manufacturers reduced log supply to domestic sawmills and drove log prices higher freight expense increased 1 4 million as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 higher freight expense was attributable to increased in market sales to china consistent with our strategy increased freight costs arising from a 9 increase in lumber shipments were largely offset by savings from lower log shipments fourth quarter adjusted ebitda and operating income included 10 1 million of countervailing duty cvd and anti dumping duty ad as compared to 0 1 million in the same quarter last year cvd was not in effect until december 28 2017 duty expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 was offset by a 3 5 million export tax recovery due to differences in preliminary and revised duty rates selling and administration expense fourth quarter selling and administration expense was 7 6 million in 2018 as compared to 7 4 million in the same period last year a decline in our common share price over the quarter resulted in a 0 7 million mark to market recovery related to share based compensation plans we incurred comparatively greater expense related to foundational system and process improvements in support of our growth strategy net income net income for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 5 3 million as compared to 19 0 million for the same period of 2017 operating margins and net income were reduced by higher export duty and stumpage expenses arlington operation update in the fourth quarter of 2018 we invested 4 5 million in arlington infrastructure and equipment upgrades approximately 24 of all us bound shipments were distributed through the facility in the fourth quarter of 2018 with infrastructure upgrades and equipment installation nearing completion we expect to commission secondary processing late in the first quarter of 2019 and continue to increase the portion of us bound shipments distributed through arlington sale of ownership interest in port alberni forest operations on december 14 2018 western announced it had reached an agreement whereby the huu ay aht first nations will acquire a 7 interest from western in a newly formed limited partnership for 7 2 million subject to closing adjustments the transaction the assets of the limited partnership will consist of port alberni forest operation including tfl 44 and certain other associated assets and liabilities the company will continue to source fibre from the limited partnership assets to support its bc manufacturing facilities the completion of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is scheduled to close late in the first quarter of 2019 as part of the agreement western may sell huu ay aht first nations an incremental interest in the limited partnership subject to further negotiation columbia vista asset acquisition on february 1 2019 we completed the asset acquisition of columbia vista corporation s operations in vancouver washington this acquisition is consistent with our strategy of pursuing margin focused business opportunities that complement our position in selected markets bringing western and columbia vista together provides us the opportunity to expand our douglas fir specialty product offerings particularly in japan which will support our bc based hemlock programs the combination of columbia vista and western makes us more meaningful to our selected customers and creates a stronger company for all our employees summary of 2018 annual results we delivered an annual adjusted ebitda of 143 5 million in 2018 and adjusted ebitda margin of 12 0 despite facing the significant headwinds of an incremental 27 2 million in export duty expense and additional stumpage expense of 30 6 million both of which more than doubled from last year operating income prior to restructuring items and other income decreased by 12 from 2017 to 103 4 million sales lumber revenue increased by 11 in 2018 to 952 9 million as we grew sales volumes and improved price realizations average lumber price realizations were 6 higher compared to 2017 despite proportionately higher commodity sales commodity lumber increased to 50 of total lumber shipments in 2018 from 45 in 2017 conversely wrc lumber shipments declined to 23 from 28 in the prior year due in part to a more normal seasonal wrc sales cycle in the fourth quarter of 2018 we grew shipments to china to capitalize on strong market demand and pricing while at the same time partially mitigating the impact of us duties log revenue was 160 0 million in 2018 a decrease of 54 8 million from 2017 due to a 9 decrease in log shipments lower log revenue was the result of the temporary suspension of our export log sales program in 2018 to supply our coastal sawmills and capitalize on increased demand for commodity lumber by product revenue increased to 83 8 million in 2018 from 70 4 million in 2017 chip price realizations increased 23 more than offsetting a 7 reduction in sales volumes lower shipments were driven by reduced chip volumes purchased for resale operations lumber production was 864 million board feet a 9 increase over 2017 in addition we produced 14 million board feet equivalent of custom cut production for a third party in the first quarter of 2018 which was not reflected in our lumber production volume higher opening log inventory and increased mill operating hours improved total production in addition we directed export logs into our manufacturing operations to leverage our flexible operating platform and capitalize on strong commodity markets in the first half of 2018 operating costs were driven lower year over year through a heavier mix of commodity lumber and incremental benefits realized from our strategic capital initiatives the recapitalization of our duke point sawmill and improved opening log inventory facilitated a 30 increase in total operating hours as compared to 2017 the ramp up of our rebuilt duke point planer operation has supported the reduction of secondary remanufactured lumber processed via higher cost third party facilities while growing our production of finished lumber products the cost benefits of these operating improvements were partly offset by a 25 increase in primary production volumes at third party custom cut facilities year over year we leveraged these facilities in order to supply our customers needs optimize sawmill cut schedules and grow overall production log production for 2018 was 4 328 000 cubic metres 8 higher than 2017 despite the impact of the worst coastal fire season on record log costs were 7 higher due to increased stumpage a higher percentage of grapple yarding and the mix of operations offset by our margin improvement initiatives and reduced helicopter logging we supplemented our internal log supply with saw log purchases of 979 000 cubic metres a 15 decrease from 2017 the temporary suspension of our export log program limited our ability to successfully procure logs from government auctioned standing timber sales increased pricing for purchased logs was driven by strong demand freight expense decreased by 12 6 million in 2018 to 90 6 million the temporary suspension of our export log sales program more than offset the impact of a 5 increase in lumber shipments over 2017 selling and administration expense selling and administration expenses were 32 0 million as compared to 32 8 million in 2017 mark to market recovery related to share based compensation plans more than offset increased it costs related to foundational system and process improvements in support of our growth strategy finance costs finance costs were 2 7 million in 2018 compared to 2 5 million in 2017 on august 8 2018 we announced the execution of a new 250 million syndicated credit facility the facility which matures on august 1 2022 includes an accordion feature to access an additional 100 million of debt as part of this refinancing we recognized the remaining deferred financing costs of the previous credit facilities the company had drawings of 7 0 million on the credit facility as at december 31 2018 net income net income was 69 2 million as compared to 74 4 million in 2017 reduced operating margins were offset by reduced operating restructuring items and lower income tax expense operating restructuring items we incurred 4 8 million of operating restructuring costs in 2018 including 2 2 million relating to the indefinite curtailment of our somass sawmill 1 5 million in severance and related expenses attributable to ongoing business optimization initiatives and 0 6 million incurred to retrain employees affected by the closure of the englewood train operation operating restructuring costs were 14 4 million in 2017 due primarily to the indefinite curtailment of our somass sawmill and closure of the englewood train our somass sawmill remains indefinitely curtailed as a result of a fibre supply deficit arising from years of tenure takebacks and government land use decisions and rising costs associated with the us softwood lumber dispute we are evaluating options to create a sustainable long term solution for the site and we are considering the input of government first nations and other stakeholders income taxes we used the majority of our remaining non capital loss carryforwards during the second quarter of 2018 which will result in cash taxes payable for the tax year ending december 31 2018 accordingly current income tax expense of 14 3 million and deferred income tax expense of 11 3 million respectively were recognized in net income in 2018 total income tax expense decreased by 1 3 million from the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of lower operating earnings deferred income tax recovery of 0 2 million was recognized through other comprehensive income as a result of actuarial losses arising from our legacy defined benefit pension plans in 2017 we recognized deferred income tax recovery of 0 7 million through other comprehensive income as a result of actuarial losses arising from these pension plans at december 31 2018 the company and its subsidiaries had unused non capital loss carry forwards totaling approximately 2 0 million in canada and 2 1 million in the us which can be used to reduce taxable income in addition the company has unused capital losses carried forward of approximately 93 7 million in canada which are available indefinitely in may 2018 the company received correspondence from the canada revenue agency cra regarding certain restructuring transactions occurring in 2004 and 2007 to 2011 and the general anti avoidance rule management believes the cra s position is without merit management is prepared to defend its position if a notice of reassessment is issued and as such the company has not recognized any income tax provision as at december 31 2018 relating to this matter strategy and outlook western s long term business objective is to create superior value for shareholders by building a margin focused log and lumber business of scale to compete successfully in global softwood markets we believe this will be achieved by maximizing the sustainable utilization of our forest tenures operating safe efficient low cost manufacturing facilities and augmenting our sales of targeted high value specialty products for selected global customers with a lumber wholesale program we seek to manage our business with a focus on operating cash flow and maximizing value through the production and sales cycle we routinely evaluate our performance using the measure return on capital employed sales marketing strategy update we are progressing with the execution of our sales and marketing strategy that focuses on the production and sale of targeted high margin products of scale to selected customers we supplement our key product offerings with purchased lumber to deliver the suite of products our customers require to accelerate and lead our sales and marketing initiatives we made the following executive management additions in the fourth quarter of 2018 bruce alexander joined western as the senior vice president sales marketing and manufacturing mr alexander is an experienced executive and brings over 30 years of sales manufacturing and management experience in the forest products and manufacturing industries including on the coast of bc mr alexander will be responsible for positioning western as the leading global supplier of specialty building materials common leadership of sales marketing and manufacturing business units will drive alignment between these functions and is expected to optimize the production of targeted products of scale and grow our selected customer base worldwide don mcgregor joined western as vice president wholesale lumber mr mcgregor brings almost 30 years of lumber marketing experience including more than 20 years as president of vanport canada a leading wholesale lumber company mr mcgregor is responsible for leading wholesale lumber operations and in building relationships with global suppliers broadening the scope of our specialty product offerings through the existing industry leading product portfolio and complementary supply from new supply relationships mr mcgregor will expand product offerings to deliver greater value to our selected customers market outlook despite the recent volatility in commodity lumber pricing our long term view of market fundamentals remains unchanged in north america rising lumber consumption will continue to be driven by increased new home construction and a robust repair and renovation sector we expect lumber demand in china to continue to grow due to a government commitment to housing while in japan lumber consumption is expected to remain relatively stable over the next few years the supply of commodity lumber exceeded demand in north america in the second half of 2018 as new home construction stalled benchmark kd spf 2x4 pricing fell more than 49 from the peak in may 2018 which led to numerous mill production curtailments demand in china for commodity lumber has remained relatively strong despite declining prices we successfully grew china lumber shipments by 12 in 2018 lumber shipments to japan declined by 19 in 2018 mainly due to limited douglas fir log availability looking ahead we anticipate north american demand and pricing for commodity lumber to improve as we enter the spring building season however we do not expect pricing to repeat last year s record performance as idled commodity lumber capacity is likely to respond to improved demand moderating any pricing response lumber pricing in china has reset and is expected to remain flat through the first quarter of 2019 as that market enters the seasonal holiday slowdown we will continue to monitor these prices and make adjustments in our operating plans accordingly in the first half of 2019 we expect wrc pricing trends to be product specific we anticipate prices to remain stable for wrc timbers and wide width wrc products in contrast we expect the narrow width wrc lumber market to remain weak due to substitution from low priced imported lumber and an abundant supply of narrow width us cedar lumber production we anticipate pricing in high value wrc export markets to weaken to mitigate the impact of lower wrc pricing we will endeavor to manage our product mix our japan product mix is expected to improve with the inclusion of douglas fir sales from our columbia vista division we expect demand in japan to be relatively stable for the first half of 2019 as builders look to complete projects ahead of an expected increase in the japanese consumption tax the recent closure of a japanese fir sawmill is expected to support fir pricing demand for hemlock products is expected to remain pressured due to domestic product substitution we expect further decreases in domestic saw log prices in response to declining lumber markets through the first quarter of 2019 strategic capital program update we continue to implement a strategic capital program that is designed to position western as the only company capable of sustainably consuming the complete profile of the coastal forest and competitively manufacturing a diverse product mix for global markets our strategic capital program is focused on the installation of technology that will deliver top quartile performance and improve our ability to manufacture targeted products that yield the best margin in addition to investments in our manufacturing assets we also allocate capital to strategic high return projects involving our information systems timberlands assets and forest inventories in the fourth quarter of 2018 we continued to make advancements with the latest phase of the duke point planer rebuild and progressed on a number of small high return capital projects focused on debottlenecking our manufacturing operations we completed our acquisition of columbia vista corporation in vancouver washington on february 1 2019 for us 30 5 million subject to post closing working capital adjustments the assets acquired include a sawmill operation and separate remanufacturing site with 18 dry kilns and planer facilities scheduled for the first half of 2019 are the completion of a series of high return low cost strategic capital projects at our duke point saltair and cowichan bay operations along with the modernization of our forklift fleet as we implement a centralized fleet management program we will continue to upgrade our processing equipment at arlington and expect the facility to begin commissioning in the first quarter of 2019 softwood lumber dispute and us market update western s results for 2018 include 43 0 million of export duty expense comprised of cvd and ad expense at february 1 2019 western had 64 9 million of cash on deposit with the us department of treasury in respect of these softwood lumber duties the us application of duties continues a long standing pattern of us protectionist action against canadian lumber producers we disagree with the us trade determination and the inclusion of specialty lumber products particularly western red cedar and yellow cedar products in this commodity lumber focused dispute as duties paid are determined on the value of lumber exported and as our shipments to the us market are predominantly high value appearance grade lumber we are disproportionately impacted by these duties we have filed a chapter 19 north american free trade agreement separate like product challenge on which a ruling is not expected until late 2019 us market sales represent less than 25 of western s total revenue in 2018 continued strong demand and a lack of supply has supported improvements in our specialty lumber product pricing partly offsetting the impact of duties our acquisition of a distribution and processing centre in arlington washington and the assets of columbia vista corporation in vancouver washington are expected to partially mitigate the damaging effects of duties on our products destined for the us market while increasing us market sales we intend to leverage our flexible operating platform to continue to overcome any challenges that arise from this trade dispute forward looking statements and information this press release

statements are based only on information currently available to us and refer only as of the date hereof except as required by law we undertake no obligation to update forward looking statements reference is made in this press release to adjusted ebitda which is defined as operating income prior to operating restructuring items and other income plus amortization of property plant equipment and intangible assets impairment adjustments and changes in fair value of biological assets adjusted ebitda margin is ebitda presented as a proportion of revenue western uses adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin as benchmark measurements of our own operating results and as benchmarks relative to our competitors we consider adjusted ebitda to be a meaningful supplement to operating income as a performance measure primarily because amortization expense impairment adjustments and changes in the fair value of biological assets are non cash costs and vary widely from company to company in a manner that we consider largely independent of the underlying cost efficiency of their operating facilities further the inclusion of operating restructuring items which are unpredictable in nature and timing may make comparisons of our operating results between periods more difficult we also believe adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are commonly used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties to evaluate our financial performance adjusted ebitda does not represent cash generated from operations as defined by international financial reporting standards ifrs and it is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs furthermore adjusted ebitda does not reflect the impact of a number of items that affect our net income adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are not measures of financial performance under ifrs and should not be considered as alternatives to measure performance under ifrs moreover because all companies do not calculate adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin in the same manner these measures as calculated by western may differ from similar measures as calculated by other companies a reconciliation between the company s net income as reported in accordance with ifrs and adjusted ebitda is included in the company s management s discussion analysis for the year ended december 31 2018 which is available under the company s profile on sedar at www sedar com also in this press release management uses key performance indicators such as net debt net debt to capitalization and current assets to current liabilities net debt is defined as long term debt less cash and cash equivalents net debt to capitalization is a ratio defined as net debt divided by capitalization with capitalization being the sum of net debt and shareholder s equity current assets to current liabilities is defined as total current assets divided by total current liabilities these key performance indicators are non gaap financial measures that do not have a standardized meaning and may not be comparable to similar measures used by other issuers they are not recognized by ifrs however they are meaningful in that they indicate the company s ability to meet their obligations on an ongoing basis and indicate whether the company is more or less leveraged than the prior year western is an integrated forest products company building a margin focused log and lumber business to compete successfully in global softwood markets with operations and employees located primarily on the coast of british columbia and washington state western is a premier supplier of high value specialty forest products to worldwide markets western has a lumber capacity in excess of 1 1 billion board feet from eight sawmills and

australia s central bank last week joined its much larger counterparts in the united states and europe in signalling an abrupt about face on monetary policy after spending months foreshadowing an increase in official interest rates from their current record low of 1 5 percent the reserve bank of australia rba announced there was an equal chance that its next rate movement would be down as in the us and the european union eu the reversal of mooted rate rises is driven by signs of a global downturn exacerbated by mounting trade war and political tensions in a speech last week rba governor philip lowe warned of the accumulation of downside risks globally he stated many of these risks are related to political developments the trade tensions between the united states and china the brexit issue the rise of populism globally and the reduced support from the united states for the liberal order that has supported the international system and contributed to a broad based rise in living standards one could add to this list the adjustments in china as the authorities rein in shadow financing lowe said any miscue by china s policy makers as its economy slowed could hurt us a lot that is because over the past two decades china has become by far australian capitalism s largest export market the switch back to what the financial media calls an accommodating monetary policy is also dictated by the insatiable demands of the financial elites amid the growing global volatility they want a prolongation of the regime of cheap money and injection of billions of dollars that has kept money markets worldwide afloat since the 2008 financial meltdown the spin across the central banking community has been incredibly dovish tilts incredibly quickly charlie jamieson of 2 billion bond fund jcb told the australian financial review there is a huge shift in that community because they foresee something that worries them domestically the rba s quarterly statement of monetary policy revealed it was becoming increasingly worried about the impact of plunging house prices on already flagging consumer spending in the context of high household debt currently weak income growth and falling house prices the resilience of consumption growth is a key uncertainty for the overall outlook the bank said some corporate analysts forecast that the cash rate would be slashed to a new all time low of 1 percent by next year while warning that this might not have the wanted effect of stimulating the economy that fear is connected to the fact that real estate prices have fallen by nearly 7 percent over the past year they are widely predicted to drop by at least another 7 percent this year spearheaded by bigger falls in sydney and melbourne the two largest cities this has ended a property bubble that propped up consumer spending and much of the economy despite falling real wages after the mining boom imploded in 2012 house prices soared up to 60 to 70 percent between 2012 and 2017 allowing people to borrow extra money against their home values as a result household debt has risen to about 200 percent of annual household income one of the highest rates in the world the rba noted a sharp decline in building approvals it said developers had told them that it had become difficult to finance apartment projects and attract sufficient pre sales to proceed dwelling investment could therefore tail off sooner and faster than earlier projected ubs economists said that based on analysis of job advertisements and historical data 50 000 construction jobs could be lost given the recent collapse in building approvals we believe there is still downside risk ubs noted the rba cut its predictions of economic growth and wages growth over the next two years effectively undercutting the liberal national coalition government s plans to announce a return to a budget surplus in a pre election budget on april 2 the bank reduced its gross domestic product outlook for 2019 from 3 3 percent to 3 percent this week saw further indicators of an accelerating bust loans to housing investors dropped by 4 6 percent to a seven year low of 4 9 billion in december down 42 percent from the december 2016 peak of 8 5 billion owner occupiers also felt the pressure with their loans falling 6 4 percent month on month to 12 5 billion the lowest level since early 2015 one of the country s biggest housing developers avjennings revealed a 90 percent plunge in profits for the six months to december to 1 42 million from 15 48 million in the year earlier period the company majority owned by singaporean developer sc global blamed extreme media coverage of the housing market slide alongside a credit squeeze by the banks due to the fallout from a royal commission inquiry into their predatory practices new car sales fell by 7 4 percent in january compared to the same month a year earlier to 81 994 adding to a lengthening list of poor household spending indicators retail sales in december usually a peak pre christmas period fell by 0 4 percent on the previous month household spending accounts for some 60 percent of the national economy so these results are ominous falling consumer spending also points to the potentially explosive cumulative affect of declining real wages and household incomes since 2012 according to calculations by the guardian s greg jericho in real terms the average compensation per employee has declined since 2012 from just above 20 000 to under 19 500 that is primarily the product of the destruction of many thousands of full time jobs combined with harsher welfare laws pushing workers into low paid and insecure casual employment while joblessness officially is relatively low at 5 percent this masks the growth of under employment and widening social inequality last year corporate profits grew by around 20 percent while the average compensation per employee rose by just 1 2 percent well below the official inflation rate of 1 9 percent another set of calculations by former public servant david plunkett shows that tax and welfare changes have intensified the inequality since 2012 during the dying days of the last labor government yet both labor and the coalition are going to the election committed to further cutting taxes for companies and high income recipients during the lead up to the election which is expected to take place in may the labor party opposition and its trade union partners are anxiously trying to keep a lid on the seething discontent in the working class they are seeking to revive illusions that a labor government would take some action to lessen the yawning income and wealth gap globally however governments are being shaken by the resurgence of the class struggle after decades of suppression of workers struggles particularly by the unions whether or not there is a social explosion in australia before the election the widening social divide makes immense conflicts inevitable whichever party heads the next government it will be intent on imposing the burden of the gathering slump on working class households via yet another wave of austerity measures and permanent job shedding the author also recommends signs of slump in australia overshadow looming election

according to the economist the spiraling us debt has been the result of many factors including former president george w bush s tax cuts the great recession of 2007 2009 which prompted the obama administration to dump hundreds of billions of dollars into the economy in the form of stimulus and now trump s further tax cuts the trump tax cuts are expected to run the budget close to 2 trillion over a ten year period according to the congressional budget office trump s spending plans are harder to estimate because congress will modify them and they may change over time but it is fair to say they contribute less to the debt than the tax changes gagnon said my main criticism of the president s tax cuts is that they went almost entirely to the rich and the rich already got most of the benefits of economic growth for more than 20 years now the economist added the us national debt has grown by over 2 trillion under president trump during his first two years in office on the campaign trail in 2016 the billionaire real estate magnate promised to eliminate the debt over eight years by creating jobs and renegotiating us trade deals with countries like china the president argues that better trade deals will reduce the overall trade deficit and boost growth which will boost tax revenues this is not realistic because we are at full employment already and any further boost to growth would raise inflation force the fed to raise interest rates and choke off growth in other sectors gagnon said
by lucia mutikani washington reuters u s consumer prices were unchanged for a third straight month in january leading to the smallest annual increase in inflation in more than 1 1 2 years which could allow the federal reserve to hold interest rates steady for a while the labor department s report on wednesday supported the fed s recent description of price pressures being muted in a policy statement last month the u s central bank kept rates unchanged pledged to be patient before tightening monetary policy further and discarded promises of further gradual increases in borrowing costs inflation still appears to be well in check said jim baird chief investment officer at plante moran financial advisors in kalamazoo michigan that should be enough for the fed to take time to evaluate the gradual effects of its prior rate hikes and move more slowly and thoughtfully in administering rate policy in the months ahead the consumer price index last month was held down by cheaper gasoline which offset increases in the cost of food rent healthcare recreation apparel motor vehicles and household furnishings in the 12 months through january the cpi rose 1 6 percent the smallest gain since june 2017 the cpi increased 1 9 percent on a year on year basis in december excluding the volatile food and energy components the cpi gained 0 2 percent rising by the same margin for a fifth straight month in the 12 months through january the so called core cpi rose 2 2 percent for a third straight month economists polled by reuters had forecast the cpi edging up 0 1 percent in january and the core cpi rising 0 2 percent while the steady increases in core inflation resulted in the biggest three month annualized gain in 10 months economists said they did not believe it signaled a material shift in underlying inflation trends the fed will be focused more on longer time frames said eric winograd senior economist at alliancebernstein in new york the quarter on quarter annualized figure has moved both higher and lower without signaling any meaningful change in the year on year rate before the dollar rose against a basket of currencies as traders focused on the three month rise in the core cpi prices of u s treasuries fell stocks on wall street were trading higher amid optimism that the united states and china could strike a deal during trade talks in beijing little upside risk despite the increases in the core cpi underlying inflation remains moderate the fed which has a 2 percent inflation target tracks a different measure the core personal consumption expenditures pce price index for monetary policy the core pce price index increased 1 9 percent on a year on year basis in november after rising 1 8 percent in october it hit 2 percent in march 2018 for the first time since april 2012 pce price data for december will be released on march 1 it was delayed by a five week partial shutdown of the federal government that ended on jan 25 inflation is remaining moderate despite a tightening labor market in part because of slowing economic growth in china and europe which is helping to lower oil prices we don t see a ton of upside risk to inflation over the next several months said ryan sweet a senior economist at moody s analytics in west chester pennsylvania the unemployment rate could fall even further without stoking significant inflation since the slope of the phillips curve remains flat the phillips curve describes the relationship between inflation and unemployment it holds that as unemployment declines inflation should rise in the current environment the lack of a strong inflation impulse suggests there is no danger of the labor market overheating in january gasoline prices fell 5 5 percent after dropping 5 8 percent in december food prices increased 0 2 percent rising for a third straight month there were increases in the prices of poultry eggs fish and beef but consumers paid less for fruits vegetables cereals and dairy products owners equivalent rent of primary residence which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home increased 0 3 percent in january after gaining 0 2 percent in the prior month the cost of postage stamps jumped 1 7 percent the most since february 2013 healthcare costs rose 0 2 percent after advancing 0 3 percent in december with doctor visits costing more apparel prices surged 1 1 percent last month the biggest increase since february 2018 airline fares dropped 0 9 percent the cost of motor vehicle insurance fell for a third straight month reporting by lucia mutikani editing by paul simao

another year of strong performance well balanced regional supply demand fundamentals in both softwood and hardwood segments continue to support attractive stable log pricing across all key markets commented mark bishop chief executive officer of acadian acadian generated solid results for the year ended december 31 2018 the company s adjusted ebitda1 totaled 22 1 million in 2018 compared to 23 3 million during 2017 the strong demand and pricing acadian experienced in the first half of 2018 carried through to year end reflecting the favorable attributes of northeast regional log markets as a result log sales from our freehold operations were strong throughout the period with volumes and pricing up year over year the benefits of which were offset by lower ancillary revenues from providing timber services and a lower amount of gains on land sales relative to the prior year acadian declared dividends to its shareholders of 1 1225 per share during the year representing a payout ratio1 of 106 which is above our long term target of 95 we anticipate that over the long term we will revert to a payout ratio consistent with our target level and in the near term acadian s strong cash position supports a payout ratio in excess of our target 1 this news release makes reference to adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin free cash flow and payout ratio which are key performance measures in evaluating acadian s operations and are important in enhancing investors understanding of acadian s operating performance adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are used to evaluate operational performance free cash flow is used to evaluate acadian s ability to generate sustainable cash flows from our operations while payout ratio is used to evaluate acadian s ability to fund its distribution using free cash flow acadian s management defines adjusted ebitda as earnings before interest taxes fair value adjustments recovery of or impairment of land and roads realized gain loss on sale of roads and other fixed assets unrealized exchange gain loss on debt depreciation and amortization and adjusted ebitda margin as adjusted ebitda as a percentage of its total revenue free cash flow is defined as adjusted ebitda less interest paid current income tax expense and capital expenditures plus net proceeds from the sale of fixed assets selling price less gains or losses included in adjusted ebitda payout ratio is defined as dividends declared divided by free cash flow as these performance measures do not have standardized meanings prescribed by international financial reporting

current year presentation as a result of adoption of ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers on january 1 2018 acadian generated net sales of 99 8 million in 2018 a year over year increase of 4 4 million as the company benefited from a 3 increase in log sales volumes due to strong demand and favourable operating conditions acadian s weighted average log selling price increased 2 reflecting strong markets for all products the benefits of which were partially offset by changes in the sales mix while log sales from our freehold operations were strong ancillary revenues from providing timber services and gains on land sales were lower in 2018 versus 2017 costs of 78 6 million in 2018 increased 6 from 74 3 million in the prior year primarily due to a 3 increase in log sales volumes in addition variable log harvest costs per m3 increased 2 due to longer average haul distances and higher fuel costs the impacts of which were partially offset by changes in the sales mix acadian generated adjusted ebitda of 22 1 million during 2018 compared to 23 3 million in the prior year while the adjusted ebitda margin of 22 for 2018 decreased from 24 in 2017 net income for the year ended december 31 2018 totaled 26 3 million or 1 57 per share compared to 30 8 million or 1 84 per share in 2017 the decrease in 2018 is primarily the result of an unrealized foreign exchange loss on the revaluation of u s dollar denominated long term debt compared to an unrealized gain in the prior year partially offset by a favourable fair value revaluation of timber assets segment performance new

timberlands for the year ended december 31 2018 totalled 74 8 million compared to 71 7 million in 2017 the increase reflects a 4 improvement in log sales volumes due to strong demand and favourable harvest conditions the weighted average log selling price during 2018 remained in line with the prior year as price increases for all products were offset by a change in the sales mix adjusted ebitda for the year ended december 31 2018 was 16 6 million compared to 18 1 million in 2017 the decrease was driven by higher variable log harvest costs per m3 attributable to longer average haul distances and higher fuel costs and timing of timber services the impact of which was partially offset by the increase in log sales volumes as a result the adjusted ebitda margin was 22 for 2018 compared to 25

the current year results reflect a 6 increase in the weighted average log selling price due to strong demand for softwood sawlogs and hardwood pulpwood compared to the prior year this benefit was partially offset by a 1 decrease in log sales volumes as hardwood harvest activities were adjusted to reflect our commitment to manage maine timberlands annual harvest volumes to sustainable levels adjusted ebitda for the year ended december 31 2018 was 6 8 million in line with 2017 while net sales were higher and variable log harvest cost per m3 were down year over year due to changes in the sale mix these positive effects were offset by lower gains on sale of higher and better use hbu land of 1 5 million compared to the prior year the adjusted ebitda margin for 2018 decreased slightly to 27 from 28 in the prior year adoption of ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers ifrs 15 supersedes previous revenue standards ias 18 revenue and related interpretations and it applies to all revenue arising from contracts with customers on january 1 2018 the company adopted ifrs 15 using the full retrospective approach the adoption of this standard on january 1 2018 resulted in a change in presentation from net to gross for timber services which does not impact the company s operating earnings or net income as a result of this change in presentation net sales for the year ended december 31 2017 increased by 17 6 million respectively with a corresponding increase in operating costs and expenses net sales are net of discounts and rebates to customers if any revenue is recognized when control passes to the customer which is generally when timber is delivered to the customer and actual quantities delivered are determined sales are governed primarily by contractual terms with customers and in some cases by standard industry terms pursuant to the crown lands services agreement acadian provides harvesting transportation and other services to crown licensees and sub licensees acadian receives payment for these services which are recognized in revenue upon delivery of the timber and when actual quantities delivered are determined market outlook the following contains forward looking information about acadian timber corp s market outlook for the remainder of 2019 reference should be made to the the section entitled cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements section of this news release for a description of material factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements in the following please see the risk factors section of our management s discussion and analysis of acadian s most recent annual report and annual information form available on our website at www acadiantimber com or filed with sedar at www sedar com acadian s key markets include softwood sawtimber hardwood sawtimber and hardwood pulpwood northeast north american softwood dimension sawmills represent over one third of acadian s end use market and are the primary market for our softwood sawtimber our mixed softwood and hardwood resource combined with diversified end use markets underpin acadian s best in class long term performance well balanced regional supply demand fundamentals continue to support attractive stable log pricing across all key markets the case for continued steady recovery in u s housing starts over the medium term remains highly compelling demographics support continued solid growth in household formation home inventories are extremely low and on average u s housing stock is beyond its prime however tight construction labour markets and restrictive building regulations have combined with near term concerns of rising interest rates and fallout from u s international trade policy to drive what most forecasters believe will be a short lived slowdown in construction activity recent consensus forecasts anticipate average year over year growth in u s housing starts for 2019 and 2020 of about 1 and 3 respectively importantly most forecasters expect the proportion of single family starts the largest lumber consuming segment of u s housing starts to improve modestly through 2019 and 2020 additionally home repair and remodeling the single largest driver of north american lumber consumption is also projected to grow modestly over the next two years north american sawtimber demand is therefore expected to post modest year over year growth even under more conservative forecasts average q4 2018 quarterly benchmark eastern spruce pine fir and southern yellow pine lumber prices declined 30 and 11 respectively from the prior quarter the continued slide in pricing from the prior quarter was driven by weaker than expected home sales and building activity through the quarter despite the robust u s economy buyer apprehension remains high due to risk of federal reserve interest rate increases and the potential for slowing global economic growth forecasters anticipate that extensive announced market downtime which has been extended into the first quarter of 2019 principally in the high log cost region of the interior of british columbia coupled with ongoing steady demand growth will support continued strong lumber pricing through 2019 albeit below the levels achieved in 2018 considering capacity and log supply constraints exhibited in western canada during late 2018 and early 2019 we anticipate continued attractive market dynamics to support stable softwood sawtimber pricing in acadian s regional markets given the current state of u s trade relations there is no expectation of any meaningful discussions toward a softwood lumber agreement with canada during 2019 further we anticipate no material change in 2019 to the current duty rates for canadian lumber producers average consensus forecast lumber prices for 2019 would indicate that a significant proportion of those duties will continue to be passed on to u s consumers we remain steadfast in our view that an eventual negotiated settlement will include an exemption for all canadian maritime producers including those in new brunswick hardwood sawtimber markets typically oriented to millwork and higher value specialty markets remain well balanced with a continued positive outlook for the foreseeable future while there has been modest price erosion in the latest quarter the outlook for global pulp markets remains positive particularly in the containerboard and tissue segments hardwood pulpwood demand in acadian s operating region remains stable with well balanced supply conditions continuing to support historically strong pricing softwood pulpwood markets acadian s smallest product segment by volume and margin have seen some modest recovery and the recently announced re start of a pulp mill in maine during 2019 is expected to be a catalyst for further recovery in softwood pulpwood demand and pricing through the second half of 2019 in new brunswick biomass markets continue to be supported by export demand which is expected to remain strong throughout 2019 while the biomass market in maine remains weak efforts to tap into biomass export markets continue to progress

cortez goldrush and turquoise ridge continued to advance according to schedule and within budget underpinning the next generation of profitable production from this core region for barrick exploration drilling continued to intersect high grade mineralization at these properties demonstrating the significant untapped geological potential of barrick s land position in nevada and supporting the evaluation of increasing processing capacity in the region we also advanced studies and test work in support of an expansion to increase throughput at the pueblo viejo mine in the dominican republic by 50 percent with positive initial results 12 reflecting our commitment to shareholder returns we increased our annual dividend by 33 percent from 12 cents per share in 2017 to 16 cents per share in 2018 in addition we continued to strengthen our balance sheet with the repurchase of 629 million in outstanding notes in july bringing the company s total debt repayments to roughly 10 billion over the past five and a half years during 2018 barrick also strengthened its partnership with shandong gold group co ltd one of china s leading mining companies in july the two companies announced an enhanced strategic cooperation agreement focused on evaluating the lama project in argentina and strengthening technical collaboration between the barrick and shandong teams in september barrick and shandong signed a mutual investment agreement under which each company agreed to purchase up to 300 million of shares in the other further deepening the partnership the completion of barrick s transformational merger with randgold on january 1 2019 created an industry leading gold company with a common vision for long term value creation it significantly strengthened barrick s position across key metrics relative to the senior gold peer group13 including ownership of five of the world s top 10 tier one14 gold assets and two potential tier one gold assets under development the lowest total cash costs15 high quality gold reserves and extensive land positions in many of the world s most prolific gold districts positioning the company for sustainable growth as we move forward as one team barrick s vision is to be the world s most valued gold mining business to achieve this the company will focus on optimizing our existing operations pursuing new opportunities that meet strict investment criteria and developing them with disciplined efficiency by doing so we aim to deliver sustainable returns to our owners and real benefits to our partners host countries and communities financial comments our liquidity position is strong and continues to improve with robust cash flow generation modest near term debt repayment obligations a 3 billion undrawn credit facility and a consolidated cash balance of approximately 1 6 billion we reduced our total debt by 685 million or 11 percent in 2018 and with more than 85 percent of the company s outstanding debt due after 2032 barrick now has one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry in addition as of december 31 2018 randgold had 0 7 billion of cash and cash equivalents and no debt outstanding bringing the cash position of the combined company to 2 3 billion as of january 1 2019 barrick reported a net loss of 1 55 billion in 2018 primarily due to net impairment charges of 900 million relating to the veladero and lagunas norte mines and 742 million in significant tax adjustments adjusted net earnings5 of 409 million were lower than the prior year primarily due to the impact of lower grades and recoveries as anticipated along with higher direct mining costs driven by increased energy prices and consumption and the divestment of 50 percent of the veladero mine on june 30 2017 earnings were also impacted by lower throughput at acacia as a result of reduced operations at bulyanhulu lower tonnage processed at lagunas norte and increased government imposts at veladero this was partially offset by lower income tax expense as a result of lower earnings and sales volumes and lower depreciation significant adjusting items to net earnings pre tax and non controlling interest effects in 2018 include 900 million 799 million net of tax and non controlling interest in net impairment charges primarily relating to veladero and lagunas norte 742 million in significant tax adjustments primarily relating to the de recognition of deferred tax assets of 814 million partially offset by a deferred tax recovery of 107 million on united states withholding taxes additional adjustments relating to the inventory impairment at lagunas norte of 166 million a write off of a western australia long term stamp duty tax receivable of 43 million and costs associated with the merger with randgold of 37 million partially offset by 68 million 46 million net of tax and non controlling interest in disposition gains mainly relating to the sale of a non core royalty asset at acacia during the fourth quarter the company determined that the carbonaceous material project cmop at lagunas norte does not currently meet the company s investment criteria resulting in an inventory impairment of 166 million as described above barrick previously reported a non current asset impairment of 405 million at lagunas norte in the third quarter following the company s decision not to proceed with the refractory sulphide ore project pmr for more information please see the lagunas norte project update on page seven of this press release a non current asset impairment of 246 million 160 million net of tax and a goodwill impairment of 154 million were also recorded at the veladero mine in the fourth quarter reflecting an increase in the mine s cost structure related to increased government imposts and higher energy costs refer to page 62 of barrick s fourth quarter md a for a full list of reconciling items between net earnings and adjusted net earnings for the current and prior year in 2018 we generated 1 77 billion in operating cash flow lower operating cash flow compared to 2017 primarily reflects lower sales volumes and increased direct mining costs as described above this was partially offset by a favorable movement in working capital mainly as a result of increased drawdown of inventory and the timing of payments and changes in other current assets and liabilities operating cash flow also benefited from lower cash taxes paid reflecting lower earnings and sales volume and higher realized gold prices compared to 2017 capital expenditures were at the low end of our guidance range for the year and in line with 2017 with an increase in project capital expenditures offset by a decrease in minesite sustaining capital expenditures free cash flow of 365 million was lower than the prior year primarily driven by lower operating cash flows over the course of 2018 we continued to realize savings resulting from the implementation of our decentralized operating model as well as workforce reductions associated with the randgold merger full year corporate administration costs were 212 million significantly below our original 2018 guidance of approximately 275 million operations comments ensuring the safety of people and the environment are our most important priorities we continued to improve our safety performance in 2018 achieving a total reportable injury frequency rate trifr 7 of 0 32 the best result in the company s history and a nine percent improvement compared to 2017 since 2014 barrick has also achieved an 87 percent reduction in reportable environmental incidents with seven incidents at our operations last year down from eight in 2017 continuing a long term improvement trend in 2018 our operations produced 4 53 million ounces of gold at a cost of sales of 892 per ounce and all in sustaining costs3 of 806 per ounce as anticipated gold production improved over the second half of 2018 driven by stronger performance at barrick nevada and pueblo viejo with gold production of 1 26 million ounces in the fourth quarter compared to 1 15 million ounces in the third quarter higher costs compared to 2017 primarily reflect the impact of lower grades and recoveries higher energy costs and higher mine site sustaining capital expenditures on a per ounce basis as anticipated copper production improved progressively over the third and fourth quarters driven by a steady improvement in grade and crusher reliability at lumwana in 2018 our copper portfolio produced 383 million pounds at a cost of sales of 2 40 per pound and all in sustaining costs4 of 2 82 per pound copper production in the fourth quarter was 109 million pounds at a cost of sales of 2 85 per pound and all in sustaining costs4 of 2 95 per pound please see page 44 of barrick s fourth quarter md a for individual operating segment performance details mineral resource management barrick s 2018 year end reserve and resource statements reflect the company s asset portfolio prior to the completion of the company s merger with randgold on january 1 2019 randgold s 2018 year end reserve and resource statements can be found at www barrick com investors barrick s 2018 reserves were calculated using a gold price assumption of 1 200 per ounce consistent with 2017 as of december 31 2018 barrick s proven and probable gold reserves were 62 3 million ounces8 compared to 64 4 million ounces at the end of 2017 while 5 4 million ounces of reserves were depleted through mining and processing the company added 3 2 million ounces of reserves at an average grade of 4 7 grams per tonne significantly higher than our overall reserve grade of 1 56 grams per tonne reserves at our underground operations where the majority of the company s future production will come from were replaced with additions at turquoise ridge goldstrike hemlo and porgera in 2018 measured indicated and inferred gold resources were calculated using a gold price assumption of 1 500 per ounce consistent with 2017 measured and indicated gold resources increased slightly to 88 8 million ounces8 at the end of 2018 compared to 88 6 million ounces at the end of 2017 inferred gold resources also increased to 33 5 million ounces at the end of 20188 compared to 30 8 million ounces at the end of 2017 approximately 1 25 million ounces of proven and probable reserves 1 3 million ounces of measured and indicated resources and 1 2 million ounces of inferred resources barrick s 63 9 percent share were removed at acacia s bulyanhulu operation following a review by acacia of the mine s geological and mineral resource models and other optimization work copper reserves and resources for 2018 were calculated using a copper price of 2 75 per pound and 3 50 per pound respectively consistent with 2017 as of december 31 2018 proven and probable copper reserves were 10 6 billion pounds8 measured and indicated copper resources were 11 6 billion pounds8 and inferred copper resources were 2 8 billion pounds these figures include copper contained within gold reserves and resources exploration update exploration has been repositioned to invest in our assets with a focus on adding value at our tier one mines enhancing cash flow from other operations and discovering and developing the next generation of tier one mines we expect to incur approximately 160 to 170 million of exploration and evaluation expenditures in 2019 with approximately 80 percent allocated to the americas our 2019 program includes the following highlights in the cortez district deep drilling will continue to focus on adding resources as well as testing open mineralization extensions and concepts farther afield consolidating the goldrush and fourmile geology models is a top priority and in progress we anticipate that fourmile and goldrush have the potential to be integrated and developed as a single project see goldrush project update on page six at goldstrike we have a renewed focus on targets along a relatively poorly tested section of the post fault north of the meikle underground mine this corridor is also the current focus of underground mining expansion and resource additions as development advances north from the banshee deposit during the fourth quarter a selective re logging program at pueblo viejo led to a significant reinterpretation of the project s geology model we are preparing a fully revised geology model with a newly established dedicated site based project team this has the potential to predict the location of high grade mineralization that could be brought forward in the mine plan as mining of the existing oxide orebody at lagunas norte winds down we are focused on improving geological understanding of the remaining resources and we are actively exploring a number of other regional targets with the potential to extend the life of the mine with drilling commencing in the fourth quarter at veladero we are mounting a renewed effort to develop satellite targets and make new discoveries in the veladero lama district supported by the establishment of an experienced site based exploration team this includes drilling at quatro esquinas immediately south of the filo federico pit and at the del carmen project located in argentina adjacent to the alturas deposit in chile in africa the discovery of the high grade loulo 3 shoot highlights the potential for further discoveries around our existing orebodies continuing brownfields exploration at kibali has also identified numerous opportunities for reserve replacement at massawa brownfields exploration will focus on efforts to expand the project s resource base the north of côte d ivoire will be another key exploration target area projects update we continue to advance a pipeline of high confidence projects at or near our existing operations with the potential to contribute more than one million ounces of annual production to barrick at costs well below our current portfolio average turquoise ridge expansion nevada u s a 16 75 percent barrick 25 percent newmont the company is focused on developing turquoise ridge into a tier one mine by increasing production and resources through mechanization automation and innovation ramp up of the road header over the course of 2018 has improved safety increased throughput and dropped mining costs per tonne a second road header is on order and further evaluation of the opportunity associated with increasing the level of mechanization and automation for the mine as a whole is underway construction of a third shaft at turquoise ridge continues to advance according to schedule and within budget with efforts in 2019 focused on earthworks and shaft sinking the construction of this shaft is expected to increase annual production to more than 500 000 ounces per year 100 percent basis at an average cost of sales of around 720 per ounce and average all in sustaining costs3 of roughly 630 per ounce as of december 31 we have spent 62 million including 3 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 out of a total estimated capital cost of 300 325 million 100 percent basis on the construction this shaft initial production from the new shaft is expected to begin in 2022 with sustained production from 2023 since the end of 2015 reserves have increased by 3 5 million ounces8 100 percent basis primarily through driving down mining costs per tonne which has allowed for a lower cutoff grade thereby optimizing the way the orebody is mined the focus in 2019 is to realize the potential to further grow reserves extend mine life and grow production over and above the current mine plan through reducing costs to further lower the cutoff grade as well as extending mineralization at depth goldrush complex nevada u s a construction of twin exploration declines at goldrush accelerated in the fourth quarter and each decline has now advanced approximately 450 meters these declines will provide access to the orebody allowing for further drilling and the conversion of existing resources to reserves the exploration declines can be converted to production declines in the future subject to further permitting the project s growing resource base is now enabling the team to re evaluate and optimize the project design infill drilling at the red hill portion of the goldrush deposit continues to support geological and resource models in 2018 probable gold reserves for goldrush grew by 35 percent to 2 0 million ounces8 while measured and indicated resources remained steady at 9 4 million ounces 8 conversion of a large majority of the remaining resources to reserves as well as the significant potential to identify additional resources will begin on completion of the exploration declines and therefore is not expected for a number of years ongoing drilling at fourmile located within 500 meters of goldrush continues to intersect high grade mineralization across a number of stratigraphic horizons supporting the notion that the deposit is a northern extension of the goldrush system drilling has also expanded the footprint of fourmile to the north and the south resulting in a modest initial inferred resource inferred resources for goldrush including fourmile have increased to 3 6 million ounces 8 in 2019 we will continue to test the gap between goldrush and fourmile as well as seek to extend mineralization to the north we are also carrying out an integrated review of the geological geotechnical and geometallurgical aspects of the mineralized corridor to optimize the mine design which could impact production rates and processing options for the operation cortez deep south nevada u s a the deep south project is expected to contribute approximately 300 000 ounces of annual gold production when fully ramped up between 2024 and 2028 at a cost of sales of 650 per ounce and all in sustaining costs3 of 580 per ounce the draft environmental impact statement for the project was published in late october with the public comment period concluding in december as of december 31 we have spent 33 million including 2 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 out of a total estimated capital cost of 106 million on the deep south expansion initial production from deep south is expected in 2022 deep south will utilize infrastructure which has already been approved under current plans to expand mining in the lower zone of the cortez underground mine including the new rangefront twin declines and other underground infrastructure already in use and under construction pueblo viejo dominican republic12 60 percent barrick 40 percent goldcorp scoping studies and pilot project work are supportive of a plant expansion at the pueblo viejo mine that could increase throughput by roughly 50 percent to 12 million tonnes per year allowing the mine to maintain average annual gold production of approximately 800 000 ounces after 2022 100 percent basis to achieve this the mine is evaluating a flotation concentrator followed by ultra fine grinding and tank oxidation of the concentrate testing to date has indicated that tank oxidation is preferable to the pad pre oxidation process previously considered pueblo viejo expects to complete prefeasibility studies for the plant expansion and additional tailings capacity by the end of 2019 the project has the potential to convert roughly seven million ounces of measured and indicated resources to proven and probable reserves 100 percent basis lagunas norte carbonaceous material and refractory ore project peru in 2018 barrick updated a feasibility study on a project to extend the life of the lagunas norte mine through the sequenced installation of mill carbon in leach flotation and autoclave processing facilities during 2018 the company determined that the project does not currently meet barrick s investment criteria as a result the company is re evaluating the lagunas norte business plan the near term focus of the re evaluation will be to reduce costs improve geological understanding of the in pit reserves and near pit resources and to explore regional targets with the potential to extend the life of the mine greenfield projects long term value and

europe is the largest importer of oil 188 billion per year yet it still pays for oil in us dollars i believe the balance of power has shifted in favour of oil trade in euros to facilitate the development of energy markets in euros a change in contracts between buyers and suppliers is needed supported by a crude oil benchmark in euros this could also be used as an opportunity to create a benchmark that is more closely aligned to the crude oil mix imported by europe china and russia have both recently attempted with mixed success to establish national crude oil benchmarks trading energy markets in more than one currency is not unprecedented and indeed used to be the norm europe with its powerful currency and reliable regulatory environment should stand a good chance of success energy trade in euros would foster european economic sovereignty by reducing exposure to dollar transaction risk and hedging costs as highlighted in the european commission s recent paper the us has demonstrated a willingness to use its dominant position in the global financial markets for geopolitical objectives the industries that would most benefit from the change include refineries airlines and shipping and transportation which would yield an important benefit that would contribute to the greater use of the euro globally europe imports more than 188 billion worth of oil per year and a switch to euro pricing would not only lead to a meaningful realignment of power in energy markets but would also have an impact on financial markets the volume of eu energy trade appears small compared to the daily turnover in global fx markets of 5 trillion per day 1 6 trillion in euros but a change in eu energy trade could over time have a non negligible effect europe is by far the largest importer of oil followed by china europe s main suppliers of crude oil are kazakhstan norway nigeria and russia saudi arabia accounts for less than 6 since the historic 1974 agreement between the us and saudi arabia most of the energy trade has been dominated in us dollars the largest buyer the us and the most important supplier of oil saudi dominated opec at that time agreed to trade oil in dollars however the centre of gravity has since shifted towards europe and asia the us has become the largest producer of oil albeit so far remaining a lightweight in exports europe and china are by far the largest importers europe s key energy supplier russia is keen to de dollarise and some companies are already asking for payments for oil in euros due to the risk of sanctions in the early 2000s germany and russia explored the establishment of oil futures in euros on a european exchange but the environment was not favourable the euro was still young russia had a de facto fixed exchange rate to the dollar the euro was introduced into the ruble reference basket of the bank of russia only in 2005 and was keen to develop a closer strategic relationship with the us opec has also evolved to the surprise of most opec now de facto includes russia as an important partner following the historic visit by king salman bin abdulaziz al saud of saudi arabia to moscow in october 2017 many of the oil exporters either no longer have their currencies pegged to the dollar or are exploring different options the bank of russia moved to a fully flexible foreign exchange regime supported by a credible inflation targeting framework elvira nabiullina was named the governor of the year by euromoney in 2015 looking at the technical work done by saudi authorities it is clear that if they do decide to keep the peg it will not be for the lack of technical ability to move to a floating exchange rate the gulf cooperation council is also in flux amid saudi qatar disagreements qatar most recently left opec to facilitate the new trade europe would also need to develop a benchmark in euros that reflects the type of oil it imports price reporting mechanisms by price reporting agencies pras for spot prices and subsequently exchange traded futures markets evolved before the euro came into existence there is little incentive for incumbents to dramatically overhaul existing benchmarks despite extensive criticism reliability of supply and the nature of the regulatory environment also matter brent was originally developed in the uk due to ample production and a favourable regulatory regime with over 600 different types of crude oil produced globally there are no individual markets for most grades instead market participants use a few key benchmark prices to calculate the rest as a differential to the benchmark companies report on a voluntary basis to price reporting agencies pras then establish spot prices voluntary price reporting to the pras developed gradually in the 1980s when trading in spot markets was widespread since then price discovery has largely moved to the exchanges exchanges and pras simultaneously compete with and complement each other the futures markets at the exchanges set the price levels and the physical markets set the differentials oil benchmarks especially following the enron and libor scandals are subject to regulation key regulations are the principles for oil price reporting agencies by iosco and the eu benchmark regulation criteria for benchmarks include good governance clarity and transparency liquidity availability of data and fair and robust methodology a regulator cannot mandate for a benchmark to be created as it is set freely by market participants a regulator can however design a regime that is conducive to the development of liquid and transparent benchmarks brent european wti west texas intermediate us and to a lesser extent dubai middle east are the key global oil benchmarks brent is derived from two complementary sources a physical market via pras and a financial market via intercontinental exchange ice brent futures leading european price reporting agency platts which is part of standard poor s started reporting prices of the physical brent transactions dated brent in the 1980s towards the end of the 1980s dated brent became the underlying price for the ice brent futures brent is based on a mix of european oil production and is still the most universally used benchmark with two thirds of global oil contracts directly or indirectly referenced to it wti is the other key benchmark focused on the us production the main instruments that underlie wti are futures contracts that allow for physical delivery traded on the new york mercantile exchange nymex which is part of the cme group the role of the pras in determining wti is different and somewhat less complex than that of brent issues with existing benchmarks provide an opportune moment brent and wti enjoy the advantage of being incumbent benchmarks but each has significant issues that the reporting agencies and exchanges have been slow to address brent suffers from a long term production decline and in a couple of years is likely to reach a volume of output below the critical threshold needed to assess the price given that europe consumes an important amount of urals oil it would be natural to add urals to the brent benchmark assessment us crude oil production is now in excess of 10 million barrels per day b d compared to around 1 5 million b d from the north sea that goes into the calculation of brent contracts traded on wti cme surpassed those of brent ice by almost 30 in 2017 wti s problem is still its location and terminal capacity resulting in wide swings in the wti brent differential wti as a type of oil is also largely globally irrelevant as despite being the largest producer the us is still a lightweight in exports challengers to the established benchmarks are emerging china having overtaken the us according to the recent data as a single country buyer would like to see a benchmark that more accurately reflects its needs china launched a crude oil futures contract in renminbi on the international energy exchange ine in march 2018 china is already using renminbi to buy oil from russia and is hoping to do the same with saudi arabia an urals futures contract started trading on the st petersburg international mercantile exchange spimex in november 2016 an important question is whether or not china will see a european benchmark as a rival russia has already been diverting some of its oil to the more lucrative contracts in the east issues of market transparency and quality of regulation are central to developing a successful benchmark this may be the reason why foreign companies have remained on the sidelines of new contracts from china and russia and why the dubai contract the third most important global oil benchmark still lags far behind brent and wti stable regulatory environment is also the reason why the european union cannot mandate for the markets to create a benchmark the eu can open a dialogue on renegotiating contracts with its oil suppliers to change the currency of denomination this would require coordination among the national authorities and the european commission some suppliers may ask for a higher price to reflect potentially higher cost of hedging currency risk while others like russia may welcome the change to help it reduce dollar transaction risk ultimately benchmarks evolve because sufficient numbers of suppliers and buyers converge on standardised contracts as the european commission has already stated it would to explore technical details of promoting use of euro in energy trade working with oil companies refineries exchanges and price reporting agencies it could help design a benchmark that would most accurately reflect the new contracts there is a strong case for an oil benchmark in euros europe is the largest oil importer and russia its largest supplier would be keen to de dollarise benchmarks evolve because suppliers and buyers change their behaviour but reliable regulatory environment matters too deep and flexible crude oil benchmarks in different currencies have existed in the past they do not have to compete but can supplement each other footnotes i would like to thank michael baltensperger for excellent research assistance in this blog i focus on the energy aspect only a comprehensive policy paper by efstathiou and papadia 2018 covers other aspects of euro as an international currency refineries may need to adjust as the refined products are also globally traded in us dollars the eu exports a number of refinery products the value of this trade is however only a tenth of the the crude oil trade as most is consumed locally technical explanation of the oil price setting practices can be found here the major trading hub for wti is cushing oklahoma cushing is the delivery point for crude contracts and it is the price settlement point for wti wti crude oil flows into cushing from all points of the united states and then flows outbound through pipelines

consolidated cash balance of approximately 1 6 billion we reduced our total debt by 685 million or 11 percent in 2018 and with more than 85 percent of the company s outstanding debt due after 2032 barrick now has one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry in addition as of december 31 2018 randgold had 0 7 billion of cash and cash equivalents and no debt outstanding bringing the cash position of the combined company to 2 3 billion as of january 1 2019 barrick reported a net loss of 1 55 billion in 2018 primarily due to net impairment charges of 900 million relating to the veladero and lagunas norte mines and 742 million in significant tax adjustments adjusted net earnings5 of 409 million were lower than the prior year primarily due to the impact of lower grades and recoveries as anticipated along with higher direct mining costs driven by increased energy prices and consumption and the divestment of 50 percent of the veladero mine on june 30 2017 earnings were also impacted by lower throughput at acacia as a result of reduced operations at bulyanhulu lower tonnage processed at lagunas norte and increased government imposts at veladero this was partially offset by lower income tax expense as a result of lower earnings and sales volumes and lower depreciation significant adjusting items to net earnings pre tax and non controlling interest effects in 2018 include 900 million 799 million net of tax and non controlling interest in net impairment charges primarily relating to veladero and lagunas norte 742 million in significant tax adjustments primarily relating to the de recognition of deferred tax assets of 814 million partially offset by a deferred tax recovery of 107 million on united states withholding taxes additional adjustments relating to the inventory impairment at lagunas norte of 166 million a write off of a western australia long term stamp duty tax receivable of 43 million and costs associated with the merger with randgold of 37 million partially offset by 68 million 46 million net of tax and non controlling interest in disposition gains mainly relating to the sale of a non core royalty asset at acacia during the fourth quarter the company determined that the carbonaceous material project cmop at lagunas norte does not currently meet the company s investment criteria resulting in an inventory impairment of 166 million as described above barrick previously reported a non current asset impairment of 405 million at lagunas norte in the third quarter following the company s decision not to proceed with the refractory sulphide ore project pmr for more information please see the lagunas norte project update on page seven of this press release a non current asset impairment of 246 million 160 million net of tax and a goodwill impairment of 154 million were also recorded at the veladero mine in the fourth quarter reflecting an increase in the mine s cost structure related to increased government imposts and higher energy costs refer to page 62 of barrick s fourth quarter md a for a full list of reconciling items between net earnings and adjusted net earnings for the current and prior year in 2018 we generated 1 77 billion in operating cash flow lower operating cash flow compared to 2017 primarily reflects lower sales volumes and increased direct mining costs as described above this was partially offset by a favorable movement in working capital mainly as a result of increased drawdown of inventory and the timing of payments and changes in other current assets and liabilities operating cash flow also benefited from lower cash taxes paid reflecting lower earnings and sales volume and higher realized gold prices compared to 2017 capital expenditures were at the low end of our guidance range for the year and in line with 2017 with an increase in project capital expenditures offset by a decrease in minesite sustaining capital expenditures free cash flow of 365 million was lower than the prior year primarily driven by lower operating cash flows over the course of 2018 we continued to realize savings resulting from the implementation of our decentralized operating model as well as workforce reductions associated with the randgold merger full year corporate administration costs were 212 million significantly below our original 2018 guidance of approximately 275 million operations comments ensuring the safety of people and the environment are our most important priorities we continued to improve our safety performance in 2018 achieving a total reportable injury frequency rate trifr 7 of 0 32 the best result in the company s history and a nine percent improvement compared to 2017 since 2014 barrick has also achieved an 87 percent reduction in reportable environmental incidents with seven incidents at our operations last year down from eight in 2017 continuing a long term improvement trend in 2018 our operations produced 4 53 million ounces of gold at a cost of sales of 892 per ounce and all in sustaining costs3 of 806 per ounce as anticipated gold production improved over the second half of 2018 driven by stronger performance at barrick nevada and pueblo viejo with gold production of 1 26 million ounces in the fourth quarter compared to 1 15 million ounces in the third quarter higher costs compared to 2017 primarily reflect the impact of lower grades and recoveries higher energy costs and higher mine site sustaining capital expenditures on a per ounce basis as anticipated copper production improved progressively over the third and fourth quarters driven by a steady improvement in grade and crusher reliability at lumwana in 2018 our copper portfolio produced 383 million pounds at a cost of sales of 2 40 per pound and all in sustaining costs4 of 2 82 per pound copper production in the fourth quarter was 109 million pounds at a cost of sales of 2 85 per pound and all in sustaining costs4 of 2 95 per pound please see page 44 of barrick s fourth quarter

completion of the company s merger with randgold on january 1 2019 randgold s 2018 year end reserve and resource statements can be found at www barrick com investors barrick s 2018 reserves were calculated using a gold price assumption of 1 200 per ounce consistent with 2017 as of december 31 2018 barrick s proven and probable gold reserves were 62 3 million ounces8 compared to 64 4 million ounces at the end of 2017 while 5 4 million ounces of reserves were depleted through mining and processing the company added 3 2 million ounces of reserves at an average grade of 4 7 grams per tonne significantly higher than our overall reserve grade of 1 56 grams per tonne reserves at our underground operations where the majority of the company s future production will come from were replaced with additions at turquoise ridge goldstrike hemlo and porgera in 2018 measured indicated and inferred gold resources were calculated using a gold price assumption of 1 500 per ounce consistent with 2017 measured and indicated gold resources increased slightly to 88 8 million ounces8 at the end of 2018 compared to 88 6 million ounces at the end of 2017 inferred gold resources also increased to 33 5 million ounces at the end of 20188 compared to 30 8 million ounces at the end of 2017 approximately 1 25 million ounces of proven and probable reserves 1 3 million ounces of measured and indicated resources and 1 2 million ounces of inferred resources barrick s 63 9 percent share were removed at acacia s bulyanhulu operation following a review by acacia of the mine s geological and mineral resource models and other optimization work copper reserves and resources for 2018 were calculated using a copper price of 2 75 per pound and 3 50 per pound respectively consistent with 2017 as of december 31 2018 proven and probable copper reserves were 10 6 billion pounds8 measured and indicated copper resources were 11 6 billion pounds8 and inferred copper resources were 2 8 billion pounds these figures include copper contained within gold reserves and resources exploration update exploration has been repositioned to invest in our assets with a focus on adding value at our tier one mines enhancing cash flow from other operations and discovering and developing the next generation of tier one mines we expect to incur approximately 160 to 170 million of exploration and evaluation expenditures in 2019 with approximately 80 percent allocated to the americas our 2019 program includes the following highlights in the cortez district deep drilling will continue to focus on adding resources as well as testing open mineralization extensions and concepts farther afield consolidating the goldrush and fourmile geology models is a top priority and in progress we anticipate that fourmile and goldrush have the potential to be integrated and developed as a single project see goldrush project update on page six at goldstrike we have a renewed focus on targets along a relatively poorly tested section of the post fault north of the meikle underground mine this corridor is also the current focus of underground mining expansion and resource additions as development advances north from the banshee deposit during the fourth quarter a selective re logging program at pueblo viejo led to a significant reinterpretation of the project s geology model we are preparing a fully revised geology model with a newly established dedicated site based project team this has the potential to predict the location of high grade mineralization that could be brought forward in the mine plan as mining of the existing oxide orebody at lagunas norte winds down we are focused on improving geological understanding of the remaining resources and we are actively exploring a number of other regional targets with the potential to extend the life of the mine with drilling commencing in the fourth quarter at veladero we are mounting a renewed effort to develop satellite targets and make new discoveries in the veladero lama district supported by the establishment of an experienced site based exploration team this includes drilling at quatro esquinas immediately south of the filo federico pit and at the del carmen project located in argentina adjacent to the alturas deposit in chile in africa the discovery of the high grade loulo 3 shoot highlights the potential for further discoveries around our existing orebodies continuing brownfields exploration at kibali has also identified numerous opportunities for reserve replacement at massawa brownfields exploration will focus on efforts to expand the project s resource base the north of côte d ivoire will be another key exploration target area projects update we continue to advance a pipeline of high confidence projects at or near our existing operations with the potential to contribute more than one million ounces of annual production to barrick at costs well below our current portfolio average turquoise ridge expansion nevada u s a 16 75 percent barrick 25 percent newmont the company is focused on developing turquoise ridge into a tier one mine by increasing production and resources through mechanization automation and innovation ramp up of the road header over the course of 2018 has improved safety increased throughput and dropped mining costs per tonne a second road header is on order and further evaluation of the opportunity associated with increasing the level of mechanization and automation for the mine as a whole is underway construction of a third shaft at turquoise ridge continues to advance according to schedule and within budget with efforts in 2019 focused on earthworks and shaft sinking the construction of this shaft is expected to increase annual production to more than 500 000 ounces per year 100 percent basis at an average cost of sales of around 720 per ounce and average all in sustaining costs3 of roughly 630 per ounce as of december 31 we have spent 62 million including 3 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 out of a total estimated capital cost of 300 325 million 100 percent basis on the construction this shaft initial production from the new shaft is expected to begin in 2022 with sustained production from 2023 since the end of 2015 reserves have increased by 3 5 million ounces8 100 percent basis primarily through driving down mining costs per tonne which has allowed for a lower cutoff grade thereby optimizing the way the orebody is mined the focus in 2019 is to realize the potential to further grow reserves extend mine life and grow production over and above the current mine plan through reducing costs to further lower the cutoff grade as well as extending mineralization at depth goldrush complex nevada u s a construction of twin exploration declines at goldrush accelerated in the fourth quarter and each decline has now advanced approximately 450 meters these declines will provide access to the orebody allowing for further drilling and the conversion of existing resources to reserves the exploration declines can be converted to production declines in the future subject to further permitting the project s growing resource base is now enabling the team to re evaluate and optimize the project design infill drilling at the red hill portion of the goldrush deposit continues to support geological and resource models in 2018 probable gold reserves for goldrush grew by 35 percent to 2 0 million ounces8 while measured and indicated resources remained steady at 9 4 million ounces 8 conversion of a large majority of the remaining resources to reserves as well as the significant potential to identify additional resources will begin on completion of the exploration declines and therefore is not expected for a number of years ongoing drilling at fourmile located within 500 meters of goldrush continues to intersect high grade mineralization across a number of stratigraphic horizons supporting the notion that the deposit is a northern extension of the goldrush system drilling has also expanded the footprint of fourmile to the north and the south resulting in a modest initial inferred resource inferred resources for goldrush including fourmile have increased to 3 6 million ounces 8 in 2019 we will continue to test the gap between goldrush and fourmile as well as seek to extend mineralization to the north we are also carrying out an integrated review of the geological geotechnical and geometallurgical aspects of the mineralized corridor to optimize the mine design which could impact production rates and processing options for the operation cortez deep south nevada u s a the deep south project is expected to contribute approximately 300 000 ounces of annual gold production when fully ramped up between 2024 and 2028 at a cost of sales of 650 per ounce and all in sustaining costs3 of 580 per ounce the draft environmental impact statement for the project was published in late october with the public comment period concluding in december as of december 31 we have spent 33 million including 2 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 out of a total estimated capital cost of 106 million on the deep south expansion initial production from deep south is expected in 2022 deep south will utilize infrastructure which has already been approved under current plans to expand mining in the lower zone of the cortez underground mine including the new rangefront twin declines and other underground infrastructure already in use and under construction pueblo viejo dominican republic12 60 percent barrick 40 percent goldcorp scoping studies and pilot project work are supportive of a plant expansion at the pueblo viejo mine that could increase throughput by roughly 50 percent to 12 million tonnes per year allowing the mine to maintain average annual gold production of approximately 800 000 ounces after 2022 100 percent basis to achieve this the mine is evaluating a flotation concentrator followed by ultra fine grinding and tank oxidation of the concentrate testing to date has indicated that tank oxidation is preferable to the pad pre oxidation process previously considered pueblo viejo expects to complete prefeasibility studies for the plant expansion and additional tailings capacity by the end of 2019 the project has the potential to convert roughly seven million ounces of measured and indicated resources to proven and probable reserves 100 percent basis lagunas norte carbonaceous material and refractory ore project peru in 2018 barrick updated a feasibility study on a project to

the chinese economy is big in 2017 it was the world s biggest based on purchasing power parity its output equaled 23 12 trillion compared with 19 9 trillion for the eu and 19 3 trillion for the us china also regained its position as the world s largest exporter in 2017 topping the eu which held the position in 2016 chinese exports totaled 2 2 trillion compared with eu exports of 1 9 trillion the united states was third exporting 1 6 trillion the chinese economy also recorded an impressive 6 9 percent increase in growth last year easily beating the government s 2017 target of 6 5 percent and the 6 7 percent rate of growth in 2016 according to international estimates china was responsible for approximately 30 percent of global economic growth in 2017 the chinese government as well as many international analysts also claim that china has entered a new economic phase one that is far more domestic centered and responsive to popular needs and thus more stable than in the past when the country relied on exports to record even higher rates of growth it all sounds good however there are many reasons to question china s growth record as well as the stability of the country s economy and turn towards a new domestic centered growth strategy glowing reports aside hard times might well lie ahead for workers in china and the broader asian region chinese growth as the chart below shows china s rate of growth fell for six straight years from 2011 to 2016 before registering an increase in 2017 current predictions are for a further decline down to 6 5 percent in 2018 however chinese growth figures still need to be taken with the proverbial grain of salt as lucy hornby archie zhang and jane pong discuss in a financial times article chinese provinces routinely fudge their growth data which compromises the reliability of national growth figures for example inner mongolia one of china s most coal dependent areas and the major northern port city of tianjin have admitted to falsifying data that will probably require their 2016 gdp to be revised down they join neighboring liaoning the first province to admit to a contraction during the four year correction in commodities markets inner mongolia admitted this month that its data for added value of industrial enterprises of a certain scale were inflated 40 per cent in 2016 according to the chinese statistical yearbook secondary industry comprises 47 per cent of its gdp assuming its 2015 figures are accurate the revised 2016 figures mean the region s economy shrank 13 per cent like inner mongolia liaoning admitted to a contraction in 2016 compared with its official performance in 2015 liaoning admits it faked data for about five years but has not issued a revised series tianjin one of the big ports that services northern china could also see a revision its binhai financial district which offers tax and foreign exchange incentives to registered businesses swelled to comprise roughly half of tianjin s reported gdp last year binhai included in gdp the commercial activity of companies that were only registered there for tax purposes according to revelations last week that could result in a 20 per cent drop in reported gdp for tianjin in 2017 according to ft calculations binhai s high debt levels and access to domestic and international financing make its phantom results a concern for broader markets another possible data offender is shanxi china s most coal dependent province its official gdp growth held up admirably during the commodities downturn last summer china s anti corruption watchdog announced unspecified problems with jilin s data adding another troubled northeastern province to the list of candidates to watch wang xiangwei former editor in chief of the south china morning post sums up the situation as follows this has given rise to a popular saying that data makes an official and an official makes data the malpractice is so rampant and blatant that over the years a long running joke is that simply adding up the figures from all the provinces and municipalities reveals a sum that overshoots the national gdp by 6 1 trillion yuan more than 10 per cent in 2013 4 78 trillion yuan in 2014 and 3 6 trillion yuan in 2016 this data manipulation certainly suggests that china has regularly failed to meet government growth targets perhaps more importantly even the overstated published nation growth statistics show that china s rate of growth has steadily fallen debt problems threaten economic stability there are also reasons to doubt that china can sustain its targeted growth rate of 6 5 percent a major reason as the next chart shows is that china s growth has been underpinned by ever increasing debt said differently it appears that ever more debt is required to sustain ever lower rates of growth as matthew c klein writing in the financial times alphaville blog explains the rapidity and size of china s debt boom in the past decade has been almost entirely without precedent the few precedents that do exist japan in the 1980s the us in the 1920s are not encouraging most coverage has rightly focused on china s corporate sector particularly the debts that state owned enterprises owe to the big four state owned banks after all these liabilities constitute the biggest bulk of the total debt outstanding and also explain most of the total growth in chinese debt since the mid 2000s the explosive nature of china s corporate sector debt growth is well illustrated by comparisons to the relatively stable corporate debt ratios in other major countries as shown in the following chart china s growing debt means it likely that sometime in the not too distant future the chinese state will be forced to tighten its monetary policy making it harder for chinese companies to borrow to finance their existing levels of employment and investment thus triggering a potentially sharp slowdown in growth at the same time since much of china s corporate debt is owed to government controlled banks it is also likely that the chinese state will be able to limit the economic fallout from expected corporate defaults and avoid a major financial crisis but while corporate debt has drawn the most attention household debt is also on the rise and not so easily managed if serious repayment problems develop according to klein since the start of 2007 chinese disposable household income has grown about 12 per cent each year on average while chinese household debt has grown about 23 per cent each year on average the cumulative effect is that nominal income has slightly more than tripled but debts have grown by nearly a factor of nine all this is finally starting to affect the aggregate debt numbers household debt in china is still small relative to the total about 18 per cent as of mid 2017 but household borrowers are now responsible for about one third of the growth in total nonfinancial debt by mid 2017 chinese households held debt equal to approximately 106 percent of their disposable income roughly equal to the current american ratio what makes chinese household debt so dangerous is that as klein notes households cannot service their debts out of gdp instead they have to rely on their meagre incomes and as we see below the share of chinese national output going to households is not only low but has generally been trending downward by comparison disposable income in the us normally runs around 72 76 percent of gdp in addition it has been finance companies and private loan sharks that have done most of the consumer lending not state banks this will make it harder for the state to keep repayment problems from having a significant negative effect on domestic economic activity thus while chinese officials argue that china s new lower rate of growth represents a switch to a new more stable level of economic activity the country s debt explosion suggests otherwise as michael pettis argues in his august 14 2017 monthly report on china to argue that the authorities have been successful in stabilizing gdp growth rates and now must address credit growth misses the point entirely if gdp growth stabilizes while credit growth accelerates gdp growth cannot be said to have stabilized at least not in any meaningful way chinese economic growth can only be said to have stabilized if gdp growth rates remain constant without any increase in the debt burden i e credit grows in line with or slower than nominal gdp and in my opinion as i said above this cannot happen except at growth rates well below half the current reported gdp growth rate or less than 3 percent what new growth model for several years chinese leaders have acknowledged the need for a new growth model that would produce slower but more sustainable rates of growth as chinese premier li keqiang explained in a recent speech to the national people s congress china s economy is now in a pivotal period in the transformation of its growth model its structural improvement and its shift to new growth drivers china s economy is transitioning from a phase of rapid growth to a stage of high quality development in other words china is said to have abandoned its past export driven high speed growth strategy in favor of a slower more domestic human centered growth strategy china s current slower growth is in line with this transformation and thus should not be taken as a sign of economic weakness however there are few signs of this transformation other than a lower rate of growth for example one hallmark of the new growth model is supposed to be the shift from external to domestic private consumption based drivers of growth the slowdown in the global economy in the post 2008 period certainly makes such a shift necessary but the data as shown below reveals that there has been no significant gain in private consumption s share of gdp in fact it actually declined in 2017 china s private consumption accounted for 39 1 percent of gdp in dec 2017 compared with a ratio of 39 4 percent the previous year the ratio recorded an all time high of 71 3 percent in dec 1962 and a record low of 35 6 percent in dec 2010 and as we saw above there has been no significant increase in disposable income s share of gdp moreover the existing consumption in line with income trends remains heavily skewed towards the wealthy what has remained high as we see in the next chart is investment a pillar of the old growth model china s investment accounted for 44 4 percent of gdp in dec 2017 compared with a ratio of 44 1 percent in the previous year the ratio reached an all time high of 48 0 percent in dec 2011 and a record low of 15 1 percent in dec 1962 this investment continues to emphasize infrastructure real estate development and enhancing manufacturing capacity one example a symbol of the investment addiction can be found in china s manhattan tianjin s conch bay a 110 hectare district with a cluster of 40 high rise buildings was supposed to be the country s new financial capital as outlays surged over the past several years but in late november there were few signs of life a number of buildings were still under construction the streets were empty and even completed buildings had no occupants from 2000 to 2010 investment in tianjin the hometown of former premier wen jiabao swelled by a factor of 10 3 in fact despite official pronouncements china s accelerated growth in 2017 owes much to external sources of demand as reuters describes china s economy grew faster than expected in the fourth quarter of 2017 as an export recovery helped the country post its first annual acceleration in growth in seven years defying concerns that intensifying curbs on industry and credit would hurt expansion a synchronized uptick in the global economy over the past year driven in part by a surge in demand for semiconductors and other technology products has been a boon to china and much of trade dependent asia with chinese exports in 2017 growing at their quickest pace in four years with fixed asset investment growth at the weakest pace since 1999 exports helped pick up the slack real growth of overall exports more than fully explained the pick up in gdp growth last year oxford economics head of asia economics louis kuijs wrote in a note and as we can see from the chart below china s export gains continue to depend heavily on the us market a market that is becoming increasingly problematic in the wake of us tariff threats china s real new growth strategy the one belt one road initiative there are many pressures keeping chinese leaders from seriously pursuing a real domestic centered consumption based growth model one of the most important is that the interests of powerful political forces would be damaged if the government took meaningful steps to significantly increase the wages and improve the working conditions of chinese workers and since many in the government and party directly benefit from existing relations of production they have little reason to pursue a strategy that would threaten the profitability of china based production activity at the same time it was clear to chinese leaders that a new strategy was necessary to keep chinese growth from further decline an outcome which they feared could spur regime threatening labor militancy their answer first discussed in 2013 appears to be the one belt one road initiative the beauty of this initiative is that it allows the existing political economy to continue functioning with little change while opening up new outlets for basic industrial products produced by leading state firms creating new export markets for private producers and expanding the huge infrastructure that underpins the chinese construction industry asia monitor research center in the introduction to its asian labor update issue on the one belt one road initiative describes what is at stake as follows xi jinping s one belt one road has been described as the next round of opening up by the chinese government following the development of special economic zones and china s accession to the wto indeed the obor strategy can be seen as a very significant and ambitious next step in the expansion of the role that china plays globally and its implementation will impact on the lives of millions of people domestically and globally chinese government strategies towards both the brics and even more so towards obor which has been dubbed globalization 2 0 potentially have important implications for the direction of globalization in the future given the way that china s development strategies have led to significant environmental destruction and labor rights violations domestically and the way that its investment overseas has been frequently criticized or led to opposition due to their adverse social and environmental consequences suggest that there are legitimate causes for concern about the impacts on people and the environment of this direction in fact the special issue includes several contributions which highlight the negative consequences of this initiative the initiative is first and foremost designed to enable chinese companies to build roads railway lines ports and power grids for the benefit of china s economy these projects come with massive environmental degradation displacement of local communities and local labor exploitation it also aims to advance chinese efforts to control agricultural land and raw materials in targeted countries and promote the creation of yuan currency area it remains to be seen how successful the one belt one road initiative will be in achieving its aims what does seem clear is the talk of a new more stable humane high quality chinese economy is largely just that talk chinese leaders appear heavily invested in trying to breathe new life into the country s existing growth model a model that comes with enormous human and environmental costs

toronto feb 13 2019 globe newswire barely six weeks after its merger with randgold barrick nyse gold tsx abx is making good progress in achieving its short term priority goals as well as its full year objectives president and ceo mark bristow said here today bristow who has already visited most of the group s operations in the americas some of them twice said one of his first priorities had been to establish regional executive teams for north america latin america and africa and the middle east these are now in place and are already making a significant impact on the way barrick operates he

acquired randgold will be combined with barrick s on the basis of common calculation criteria and will be reported on that basis at the end of the year turning to the operations the higher cost of

cost cortez hills open pit in the first half of the year lower costs at turquoise ridge as well as the addition of lower cost production from loulo gounkoto and kibali are expected to partially offset this impact in 2019 higher grades improved efficiencies and tight cost discipline are expected to reverse this trend over the next two to three years bristow said the nevada assets including turquoise ridge were now being operated as a single complex and were already delivering efficiencies still in nevada the recent fourmile discovery has now been combined with the nearby goldrush in a single project which has the potential to become barrick s next tier one3 gold mine shaft sinking and construction at turquoise ridge is also on track and along with a focus on improved efficiencies and cost discipline it too has the potential for tier one status in argentina a concerted effort to drive veladero back to tier one status is under way as barrick looks to expand its latin american business at pueblo viejo in the dominican republic a scoping study and pilot plant support the expansion of what is already one of the world s largest open pit gold mines bristow said there was a renewed focus on exploration across the group s latin american portfolio the core african assets the loulo gounkoto complex in mali and kibali in the democratic republic of congo continue to reinforce their tier one status and both are maintaining the grade of their reserves the feasibility study on the massawa project in senegal has been completed and an application for a mining permit has been submitted to the government bristow said the company was continuing to engage in constructive discussions with the tanzanian government on the impasse regarding acacia and noted that it was in the interest of all stakeholders including the government to find a solution to this issue on the new business front bristow said nevada was a destination with enormous upside through brownfield extensions new discoveries and combination opportunities with other operators in the area the recently announced strategic alliance with and additional investment in reunion gold opens up a new frontier for barrick in the guiana shield exploration continues across the group s global portfolio similarly work continues on the rationalisation of the group asset portfolio bristow said the identification and sale of non core assets would be based on a carefully considered and value based process the new barrick has a unique ability to grow three dimensionally through its large and high quality exploration portfolio and geological capability the brownfields extension potential at its existing operations and new projects destined to become tier one mines bristow said this growth will be driven and directed by a management team with a mix of skills and experience that few other gold mining companies can match in the short time that we ve been together the combined team has already made great progress in applying randgold s proven strategy to a new global group that i am confident will soon earn its place as the industry s most valued company 2019 operating and capital expenditure guidance

optionality for this project and the potential to become another tier one mine for barrick within the footprint of the cortez district while the geological geotechnical and geo metallurgical aspects of the mineralized corridor are being reviewed ongoing development of the twin exploration declines at goldrush will provide access to the heart of the orebody for further drilling and the conversion

24mw off grid solar hybrid plant to support its existing 63mw thermal power station by harnessing mali s abundant solar resource this renewable energy project is part of barrick s strategy of moving away from thermal power in africa where lack of infrastructure means that many mines need to rely on self generated diesel energy making this their largest cost item utilizing hydropower in the democratic republic of congo grid power in côte d ivoire and heavy fuel baseload generators in mali barrick has already cut its energy costs significantly and the continuing roll out of renewable energy sources will ensure that its future needs are met in the most cost efficient and environmentally friendly manner the solar feasibility study forecasts that the photovoltaic plant will replace 50 000mwh y of thermal generation saving 10 million liters of fuel per year and reducing co ² emissions by 42 000 tonnes over the same period the introduction of the solar component will cut the complex s energy cost by around 2 cents kwh construction of the project which meets barrick s investment criteria of 20 irr will start later this year and it is scheduled for commissioning in late 2020 the plant will use the latest weather prediction models which will enable the power management system to switch between thermal and solar without compromising the micro grid automation drives mining into the future autonomous production systems and projects throughout barrick are being advanced as the group focuses on becoming the global leader in mining efficiency chief executive mark bristow says to achieve its goal of being the world s most valued gold company in a rapidly evolving environment where the industry s shift to developing countries will continue barrick will have to be at the leading edge of automation kibali in the democratic republic of congo is currently at the forefront with its mission control system which manages the underground ore handling logistics without human intervention from the surface but across barrick there are many automated operations and developments which are now being unified in a group strategy he says these include underground drills that can be run from surface during shift changes automated underground and open pit haulage trucks fully autonomous backfill systems remote controlled open pit drills and autonomous drilling of development and production blast holes by multiple units controlled by a single remote operator glenn heard senior vice president mining says ongoing projects currently cover five main areas underground development and production drilling production and haulage and open pit haulage and production at present all our systems have barriers which prevent human access to the autonomous operating zones our next big step will be to create a situation where autonomous and manned units can work together seamlessly within the same active areas and we re working with sandvik and other providers to achieve this he says lumwana seeks long term partnership with zambian government barrick owners of the lumwana copper mine says it is continuing to engage with the zambian government and community stakeholders about a mutually beneficial way forward for the operation subsequent to the first lumwana board meeting following the barrick randgold merger barrick s chief operating officer for africa and the middle east willem jacobs said the company was mindful that the government was under pressure to increase its revenue at the same time however its proposed tax changes would put lumwana in a challenging situation the proposed changes to taxes and royalties would imperil the mine s ability to sustain returns to all stakeholders such as the significant contribution of more than 3 3 billion it has already made to the zambian economy over the past 10 years jacobs said lumwana has made detailed proposals to the government about a partnership approach which would provide the state with an improved share in the economics of lumwana without overburdening the mine finding a win win solution between the industry and government would without doubt increase investor confidence in zambia and safeguard the long term prospects of its mining industry jacobs said media reports that barrick had sold lumwana were untrue but given the challenging conditions the mine was facing all options would have to be considered willow creek to reopen to the public the willow creek reservoir restoration project designed to create a natural spawning habitat for fish and to provide a recreational resource for the surrounding communities is nearing completion and will reopen to the public early this year the barrick owned reservoir was built in the 1920s but drained in december 2017 as a result of a gate malfunction since then the company has invested 1 7 million and 20 000 man hours in restoring the man made lake among other things barrick volunteers have helped to install the proper fish habitats nevada bighorns unlimited a sportsmen s group and barrick partner will fund the fish restocking in the north american spring this year while the fishery will take a while to return to its original level the public will at the same time be given access to the reservoir barrick and the nevada department of wildlife ndow have formed a partnership to manage the maintenance of the reservoir and the restoration of fish stocks and habitats barrick has a record of responsible water management and this agreement again demonstrates its desire to be a good corporate citizen says caleb mcadoo eastern region habitat supervisor for the ndow the reservoir is important to nevadans and our agreement will ensure its longevity and optimal use bristow hits ground running in americas a fortnight after the merger between barrick and randgold was completed new president and ceo mark bristow and members of the combined executive team set out on a tour of the north and latin american operations to accelerate the process of integration in latin america they visited pueblo viejo and veladero twice and lagunas norte and pierina each once bristow also met governor sergio uñac of san juan province to stress barrick s commitment to argentina and the importance of a mutually beneficial partnership with government the north american leg of the tour took in hemlo cortez goldstrike and turquoise ridge catherine raw coo north america notes visiting these sites in january meant we had to deal with harsh weather conditions particularly at hemlo where temperatures reached 40 degrees celsius before windchill in his meetings with employees bristow reviewed 2018 performances and 2019 budgets and spelled out what barrick would have to do to achieve its new goal of becoming the world s most valued gold company he explained that the rationalization of the business was not merely a rightsizing exercise but designed to ensure that the company was truly fit for purpose senior executives have been embedded across the operations to facilitate decision making at source and people were being aligned with each other and with corporate goals colin bower the new egm of the expanded barrick nevada which includes cortez goldstrike and turquoise ridge noted the pragmatism of bristow s approach to the business coupled with the direct communication was much appreciated the nevada team finished the visit with clarity of purpose direction and clear expectations of our contribution going forward kibali breaks records across board all key production parameters above plan the kibali gold mine produced 807 2515 ounces of gold in 2018 above its target of 750 000 ounces and 35 higher than its output the previous year this was achieved on the back of the successful ramp up in underground production and a steady improvement in the processing plant recovery and throughput barrick president and chief executive mark bristow told a media briefing in kinshasa that the record production was driven by the shaft operating at nameplate specification and the optimization of the underground materials handling system which has placed kibali at the leading edge of gold mine automation in africa despite the high activity level the mine recorded its safest year to date with no lost time injuries in the fourth quarter and no significant environmental incident bristow said the mine continued to offset the impact of its operations through environmental projects such as the 10 130 indigenous trees planted on the site last year as well as biodiversity initiatives on the health front the malaria and hiv prevalence rates continued to decrease and stood at 12 9 and 2 8 respectively at the year end the resettlement of 1 478 families from the gorumbwa site to a new village has been successfully completed and will allow the development of the next satellite pit in the mine plan in addition continuing brownfields exploration around the mine has identified numerous opportunities for reserve replacement along the kz trend and around kcd bristow noted that kibali s partnership philosophy was continuing to deliver dividends to the local economy with 39 million paid to congolese contractors in the last quarter of 2018 alone our commitment to the drc made 10 years ago when randgold started developing kibali has not dimmed and under the new banner of barrick we expect to continue to make a significant and growing contribution to the country s economy and to unlock further value for all our stakeholders he said tongon achieves revised guidance after overcoming major challenges after nine months of intermittent production caused by illegal strikes and social unrest the tongon gold mine returned to normal in the last quarter of 2018 and achieved its revised production target of 230 000 ounces for the year speaking at a media briefing in abidjan barrick president and chief executive mark bristow said the government endorsed reconciliation agreement between the mine the employees and the community was designed to create a climate in which operations would run as normal and good relations could be rebuilt this should mark a new beginning for tongon and it is significant that the minister of mines jean claude kouassi visited the mine to sign this agreement in the presence of representatives of all the stakeholders he said bristow said barrick was committed to continuing the randgold policy of investment in community projects and noted that despite the many challenges it had faced tongon had to date spent some 10 million on these initiatives all eight villages in the mine s ambit now have primary schools medical care facilities and potable water and the development of an agribusiness as a sustainable source of economic activity after the mine s closure is progressing during the year the mine s grid power supply was frequently interrupted by the roll out of the power utility s new ring circuit which also impacted production bristow said that the situation was much improved after the commissioning of the new circuit and tongon was looking forward to a more stable supply as well as a more constructive engagement with the utility it s worth noting that despite its troubled history tongon has remained profitable and has continued to pay dividends to its shareholders including the government bristow said we are committed to prolong the contribution it makes to the economy and the community by extending the mine s life exploration for additional reserves is continuing around the mine and indications are that this aim is achievable we are also maintaining our search for new world class gold deposits in our permit portfolio elsewhere in côte d ivoire loulo gounkoto complex continues to invest in its future and points to ongoing improvement in production the loulo gounkoto complex in mali posted a fourth consecutive quarterly improvement in gold production despite an illegal work stoppage that caused it to miss its full year production guidance of 690 000 ounces by 4 in addition to this 2018 was a record throughput year of more than 5 million tonnes at close to the complex s reserve grade speaking at a briefing at the mine for local media barrick president and chief executive mark bristow noted that the complex which ranks among the recently merged barrick randgold group s tier one assets was continuing to invest in its future by exploring for additional reserves and upgrading plant and equipment a preliminary economic assessment of the loulo 3 open pit and underground project has been completed and drilling continues to expand the area of high grade mineralization south of the yalea orebody exploration of the faraba structure on the gounkoto permit has shown the potential for multiple zones of mineralization to be extended bristow said at the existing operations we ve commissioned the second crusher at yalea the full integration of the automated dispatch system at gounkoto and the second radar for the geotechnical monitoring of the gounkoto pit the complex has also completed the striker belts project at gara and moved ahead with the expansion of the tailings treatment facility bristow said the continuing profitable growth of loulo gounkoto was a shining example of what could be achieved through a genuine partnership between investors managers and governments he cited the tax holiday recently granted for the development of the super pit at gounkoto as a typical instance of mutually beneficial cooperation as randgold we ve been engaged in mali for 25 years and have worked together productively with successive governments we look forward to continuing this relationship as barrick with the recently elected government and the new minister of mines our differences over the tax issue remain on the agenda and we trust that through amicable mediation we ll arrive at a solution acceptable to both parties he said bristow noted that the complex continued to improve its safety and environmental management and had obtained the new version of the iso 14001 environmental certification while retaining its ohsas 18001 health and safety rating the group was also maintaining its support for community development programs and projects at its other malian asset morila the government has formally endorsed its plan to establish an agribusiness designed to

toronto feb 13 2019 globe newswire barely six weeks after its merger with randgold barrick nyse gold tsx abx is making good progress in achieving its short term priority goals as well as its full year objectives president and ceo mark bristow said here today bristow who has already visited most of the group s operations in the americas some of them twice said one of his first priorities had been to establish regional executive teams for north america latin america and africa and the middle east these are now in place and are already making a significant impact on the way barrick operates he announced that barrick s production guidance for 2019 was between 5 1 and 5 6 million ounces of gold and between 375 and 430 million pounds of copper during 2019 the reserves and resources of newly acquired randgold will be combined with barrick s on the basis of common calculation criteria and will be reported on that basis at the end of the year turning to the operations the higher cost of sales1 guidance for gold in 2019 of 880 940 per ounce and all in sustaining costs2 guidance of 870 920 per ounce primarily reflects the planned completion of mining at the comparatively high grade low cost cortez hills open pit in the first half of the year lower costs at turquoise ridge as well as the addition of lower cost production from loulo gounkoto and kibali are expected to partially offset this impact in 2019 higher grades improved efficiencies and tight cost discipline are expected to reverse this trend over the next two to three years bristow said the nevada assets including turquoise ridge were now being operated as a single complex and were already delivering efficiencies still in nevada the recent fourmile discovery has now been combined with the nearby goldrush in a single project which has the potential to become barrick s next tier one3 gold mine shaft sinking and construction at turquoise ridge is also on track and along with a focus on improved efficiencies and cost discipline it too has the potential for tier one status in argentina a concerted effort to drive veladero back to tier one status is under way as barrick looks to expand its latin american business at pueblo viejo in the dominican republic a scoping study and pilot plant support the expansion of what is already one of the world s largest open pit gold mines bristow said there was a renewed focus on exploration across the group s latin american portfolio the core african assets the loulo gounkoto complex in mali and kibali in the democratic republic of congo continue to reinforce their tier one status and both are maintaining the grade of their reserves the feasibility study on the massawa project in senegal has been completed and an application for a mining permit has been submitted to the government bristow said the company was continuing to engage in constructive discussions with the tanzanian government on the impasse regarding acacia and noted that it was in the interest of all stakeholders including the government to find a solution to this issue on the new business front bristow said nevada was a destination with enormous upside through brownfield extensions new discoveries and combination opportunities with other operators in the area the recently announced strategic alliance with and additional investment in reunion gold opens up a new frontier for barrick in the guiana shield exploration continues across the group s global portfolio similarly work continues on the rationalisation of the group asset portfolio bristow said the identification and sale of non core assets would be based on a carefully considered and value based process the new barrick has a unique ability to grow three dimensionally through its large and high quality exploration portfolio and geological capability the brownfields extension potential at its existing operations and new projects destined to become tier one mines bristow said this growth will be driven and directed by a management team with a mix of skills and experience that few other gold mining companies can match in the short time that we ve been together the combined team has already made great progress in applying randgold s proven strategy to a new global group that i am confident will soon earn its place as the industry s most valued company 2019 operating and capital expenditure guidance

extended ore grade mineralization such that the goldrush and fourmile resource areas are coalescing on the same geological trend the two are now being treated as one project which has increased the optionality for this project and the potential to become another tier one mine for barrick within the footprint of the cortez district while the geological geotechnical and geo metallurgical aspects of the mineralized corridor are being reviewed ongoing development of the twin exploration declines at goldrush will provide access to the heart of the orebody for further drilling and the conversion of resources to reserves the exploration declines can be converted to production declines later rod quick barrick s mineral resource management and evaluation executive confirmed that the project s

property conform to industry accepted quality control methods solar hybrid plant for loulo gounkoto as part of its cost reduction program and drive to manage its carbon footprint loulo is to install a 24mw off grid solar hybrid plant to support its existing 63mw thermal power station by harnessing mali s abundant solar resource this renewable energy project is part of barrick s strategy of moving away from thermal power in africa where lack of infrastructure means that many mines need to rely on self generated diesel energy making this their largest cost item utilizing hydropower in the democratic republic of congo grid power in côte d ivoire and heavy fuel baseload generators in mali barrick has already cut its energy costs significantly and the continuing roll out of renewable energy sources will ensure that its future needs are met in the most cost efficient and environmentally friendly manner the solar feasibility study forecasts that the photovoltaic plant will replace 50 000mwh y of thermal generation saving 10 million liters of fuel per year and reducing co ² emissions by 42 000 tonnes over the same period the introduction of the solar component will cut the complex s energy cost by around 2 cents kwh construction of the project which meets barrick s investment criteria of 20 irr will start later this year and it is scheduled for commissioning in late 2020 the plant will use the latest weather prediction models which will enable the power management system to switch between thermal and solar without compromising the micro grid automation drives mining into the future autonomous production systems and projects throughout barrick are being advanced as the group focuses on becoming the global leader in mining efficiency chief executive mark bristow says to achieve its goal of being the world s most valued gold company in a rapidly evolving environment where the industry s shift to developing countries will continue barrick will have to be at the leading edge of automation kibali in the democratic republic of congo is currently at the forefront with its mission control system which manages the underground ore handling logistics without human intervention from the surface but across barrick there are many automated operations and developments which are now being unified in a group strategy he says these include underground drills that can be run from surface during shift changes automated underground and open pit haulage trucks fully autonomous backfill systems remote controlled open pit drills and autonomous drilling of development and production blast holes by multiple units controlled by a single remote operator glenn heard senior vice president mining says ongoing projects currently cover five main areas underground development and production drilling production and haulage and open pit haulage and production at present all our systems have barriers which prevent human access to the autonomous operating zones our next big step will be to create a situation where autonomous and manned units can work together seamlessly within the same active areas and we re working with sandvik and other providers to achieve this he says lumwana seeks long term partnership with zambian government barrick owners of the lumwana copper mine says it is continuing to engage with the zambian government and community stakeholders about a mutually beneficial way forward for the operation subsequent to the first lumwana board meeting following the barrick randgold merger barrick s chief operating officer for africa and the middle east willem jacobs said the company was mindful that the government was under pressure to increase its revenue at the same time however its proposed tax changes would put lumwana in a challenging situation the proposed changes to taxes and royalties would imperil the mine s ability to sustain returns to all stakeholders such as the significant contribution of more than 3 3 billion it has already made to the zambian economy over the past 10 years jacobs said lumwana has made detailed proposals to the government about a partnership approach which would provide the state with an improved share in the economics of lumwana without overburdening the mine finding a win win solution between the industry and government would without doubt increase investor confidence in zambia and safeguard the long term prospects of its mining industry jacobs said media reports that barrick had sold lumwana were untrue but given the challenging conditions the mine was facing all options would have to be considered willow creek to reopen to the public the willow creek reservoir restoration project designed to create a natural spawning habitat for fish and to provide a recreational resource for the surrounding communities is nearing completion and will reopen to the public early this year the barrick owned reservoir was built in the 1920s but drained in december 2017 as a result of a gate malfunction since then the company has invested 1 7 million and 20 000 man hours in restoring the man made lake among other things barrick volunteers have helped to install the proper fish habitats nevada bighorns unlimited a sportsmen s group and barrick partner will fund the fish restocking in the north american spring this year while the fishery will take a while to return to its original level the public will at the same time be given access to the reservoir barrick and the nevada department of wildlife ndow have formed a partnership to manage the maintenance of the reservoir and the restoration of fish stocks and habitats barrick has a record of responsible water management and this agreement again demonstrates its desire to be a good corporate citizen says caleb mcadoo eastern region habitat supervisor for the ndow the reservoir is important to nevadans and our agreement will ensure its longevity and optimal use bristow hits ground running in americas a fortnight after the merger between barrick and randgold was completed new president and ceo mark bristow and members of the combined executive team set out on a tour of the north and latin american operations to accelerate the process of integration in latin america they visited pueblo viejo and veladero twice and lagunas norte and pierina each once bristow also met governor sergio uñac of san juan province to stress barrick s commitment to argentina and the importance of a mutually beneficial partnership with government the north american leg of the tour took in hemlo cortez goldstrike and turquoise ridge catherine raw coo north america notes visiting these sites in january meant we had to deal with harsh weather conditions particularly at hemlo where temperatures reached 40 degrees celsius before windchill in his meetings with employees bristow reviewed 2018 performances and 2019 budgets and spelled out what barrick would have to do to achieve its new goal of becoming the world s most valued gold company he explained that the rationalization of the business was not merely a rightsizing exercise but designed to ensure that the company was truly fit for purpose senior executives have been embedded across the operations to facilitate decision making at source and people were being aligned with each other and with corporate goals colin bower the new egm of the expanded barrick nevada which includes cortez goldstrike and turquoise ridge noted the pragmatism of bristow s approach to the business coupled with the direct communication was much appreciated the nevada team finished the visit with clarity of purpose direction and clear expectations of our contribution going forward kibali breaks records across board all key production parameters above plan the kibali gold mine produced 807 2515 ounces of gold in 2018 above its target of 750 000 ounces and 35 higher than its output the previous year this was achieved on the back of the successful ramp up in underground production and a steady improvement in the processing plant recovery and throughput barrick president and chief executive mark bristow told a media briefing in kinshasa that the record production was driven by the shaft operating at nameplate specification and the optimization of the underground materials handling system which has placed kibali at the leading edge of gold mine automation in africa despite the high activity level the mine recorded its safest year to date with no lost time injuries in the fourth quarter and no significant environmental incident bristow said the mine continued to offset the impact of its operations through environmental projects such as the 10 130 indigenous trees planted on the site last year as well as biodiversity initiatives on the health front the malaria and hiv prevalence rates continued to decrease and stood at 12 9 and 2 8 respectively at the year end the resettlement of 1 478 families from the gorumbwa site to a new village has been successfully completed and will allow the development of the next satellite pit in the mine plan in addition continuing brownfields exploration around the mine has identified numerous opportunities for reserve replacement along the kz trend and around kcd bristow noted that kibali s partnership philosophy was continuing to deliver dividends to the local economy with 39 million paid to congolese contractors in the last quarter of 2018 alone our commitment to the drc made 10 years ago when randgold started developing kibali has not dimmed and under the new banner of barrick we expect to continue to make a significant and growing contribution to the country s economy and to unlock further value for all our stakeholders he said tongon achieves revised guidance after overcoming major challenges after nine months of intermittent production caused by illegal strikes and social unrest the tongon gold mine returned to normal in the last quarter of 2018 and achieved its revised production target of 230 000 ounces for the year speaking at a media briefing in abidjan barrick president and chief executive mark bristow said the government endorsed reconciliation agreement between the mine the employees and the community was designed to create a climate in which operations would run as normal and good relations could be rebuilt this should mark a new beginning for tongon and it is significant that the minister of mines jean claude kouassi visited the mine to sign this agreement in the presence of representatives of all the stakeholders he said bristow said barrick was committed to continuing the randgold policy of investment in community projects and noted that despite the many challenges it had faced tongon had to date spent some 10 million on these initiatives all eight villages in the mine s ambit now have primary schools medical care facilities and potable water and the development of an agribusiness as a sustainable source of economic activity after the mine s closure is progressing during the year the mine s grid power supply was frequently interrupted by the roll out of the power utility s new ring circuit which also impacted production bristow said that the situation was much improved after the commissioning of the new circuit and tongon was looking forward to a more stable supply as well as a more constructive engagement with the utility it s worth noting that despite its troubled history tongon has remained profitable and has continued to pay dividends to its shareholders including the government bristow said we are committed to prolong the contribution it makes to the economy and the community by extending the mine s life exploration for additional reserves is continuing around the mine and indications are that this aim is achievable we are also maintaining our search for new world class gold deposits in our permit portfolio elsewhere in côte d ivoire loulo gounkoto complex continues to invest in its future and points to ongoing improvement in production the loulo gounkoto complex in mali posted a fourth consecutive quarterly improvement in gold production despite an illegal work stoppage that caused it to miss its full year production guidance of 690 000 ounces by 4 in addition to this 2018 was a record throughput year of more than 5 million tonnes at close to the complex s reserve grade speaking at a briefing at the mine for local media barrick president and chief executive mark bristow noted that the complex which ranks among the recently merged barrick randgold group s tier one assets was

it s a big fat scary round number the national debt reached 22 trillion on monday that s bigger than the entire economic output of the united states in a year is it time to panic no but it may be time to worry a bit about the direction the debt is heading what is debt the first thing to know is that 22 trillion is a misleading number because it includestwo types of debt the money the federal government owes to itself and the money the federal government owes to everybody else the former known as intragovernmental debt is mostly what the treasury owes to trust funds like social security that s important but not as important as debt held by the public which is what can impact the economy by fueling inflation or crowding out private investment right now debt held by the public stands at 16 2 trillion even if you measure it as a share of the economy that s a lot of money it s about 76 of gross domestic product which is very high by historical standards it ballooned in the wake of the great recession when the federal government spent liberally to save the economy from total collapse and hasn t been paid down much since another important note the debt is different from the deficit or the difference between what the federal government spends and what it collects in revenue each year the debt represents the accumulation of deficits over time deficits have been rising over the past several years and jumped to 3 9 of gdp in 2019 the highest share since 2013 when the country was still emerging from a deep recession in part because of tax cuts that sharply reduced government income is debt bad not necessarily it depends on what you re using it for the problem with debt is that servicing it costs money the us paid 325 billion in net interest in 2018 according to the congressional budget office which forecasts that number to jump to 383 billion in 2019 and 928 billion in 2029 under current law as a percentage of gross domestic product that will approach levels not seen since the 1980s when interest rates the cost per unit of debt were spiraling out of control interest rates are rising slowly now as the federal reserve tapers off a period of near zero rates but they remain low it s also unusual at a time when the economy is in very good shape raising the question of what happens when the government has to spend its way out of the next recession if we go through a business cycle and we re starting at this level then the business cycle would lead to very large deficits said cbo director keith hall at a briefing with reporters last month i think that s a concern as a risk going forward however it still could be worth it to rack up debt and pay a lot in interest if what the government is spending money on generates a larger economic return than the cost of credit a shift in the economic winds in recent months economists have been taking another look at their longstanding consensus that high debt levels are unequivocally bad for economic growth a view that led to austerity budgets in both the united states and europe following the great recession which may have slowed the recovery voices on the lefthave been arguing that governments can spend as much as they want in their own currency and control inflation through taxation that philosophy is known as modern monetary theory and it has been used to explain how large spending programs such as student debt relief or the green new deal might be funded most economists don t go that far but they have been cautioning over high debt levels that get out of hand a few weeks ago former obama administration economic policy officials larry summers and jason furman made the case in foreign policy that high deficits should not be used as an excuse to cut social programs like medicare and social security and that the federal government should instead find ways to recover revenues lost to generations of tax cuts and at the american economics association s conference in january former international monetary fund chief economist olivier blanchard delivered a keynote speech theorizing that debt might not be a problem as long as interest rates are reasonably low as they have been for decades now and government is using the money on projects that boost productivity such as education and infrastructure both the fiscal and welfare costs of debt may then be small smaller than is generally taken as given in current policy discussions blanchard wrote in a paper describing the argument

fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 11 0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 15 1 million for the third quarter of 2018 the year over year and sequential decrease in g a expense was primarily

million and amortization expense decreased by 0 9 million from the year ago quarter the decrease in amortization expense is primarily related to the non cash write off of goodwill in the prior year quarter partially offset by increased amortization of a commercial related intangible asset associated with the may 2018 acquisition of four high spec osvs from aries marine corporation amortization expense is expected to increase in fiscal 2019 and in fiscal 2020 as a result of currently active vessels that were placed in service under the company s fifth osv newbuild program commencing their initial intermediate drydock or special surveys the company expects amortization expense to increase whenever market conditions warrant reactivation of currently stacked vessels which will then require the company to drydock such vessels and thereafter to revert back to historical levels interest expense interest expense was 16 7 million during the fourth quarter of 2018 which was 4 5 million higher than the same period in 2017 the increase was primarily due to the company not capitalizing any construction period interest during the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to capitalizing 2

reconciling items net loss diluted eps and ebitda for fiscal 2017 would have been 91 9 million 2 49 per share and 22 8 million respectively the year over year increase in vessel revenues is attributable to improved market conditions for the company s vessels and to four osvs added to the company s fleet during the second quarter of 2018 for the twelve months ended december 31 2018 the

program that it was terminating the construction contracts for such vessels as of the date of termination these two remaining vessels both of which are 400 class mpsvs were projected to be delivered in the second and third quarters of 2019 respectively due to the uncertainty of the timing and location of future construction activities these vessels are currently projected to be delivered in the second and third quarters of 2020 respectively the company has conservatively projected to incur the remaining cash outlays associated with this program during fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 as set forth

to increase materially from projected levels coupled with the refinancing and or further management of its funded debt obligations the company does not currently expect to have sufficient liquidity to

denominator comprised only of vessel days available for service by the active fleet which excludes the impact of stacked vessel days 7 average new generation osv dayrates represent average revenue per day which includes charter hire crewing services and net brokerage revenues based on the number of days during the period that the osvs generated revenues 8 effective dayrate represents the average dayrate multiplied by the average new generation utilization rate for the respective period 9 represents revenues from shore based operations vessel management services related to non owned vessels including from the o m contract with the u s navy and ancillary equipment rentals including from rovs 10 non gaap financial measure the company discloses and discusses ebitda as a non gaap financial measure in its public releases including quarterly earnings releases investor conference calls and other filings with the securities and exchange commission the company defines ebitda as earnings net income before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization the company s measure of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies other companies may calculate ebitda differently than the company which may limit its usefulness as a comparative measure the company views ebitda primarily as a liquidity measure and as such believes that the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to it is cash flows provided by operating activities because ebitda is not a measure of financial performance calculated in accordance with gaap it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income net income or loss cash flows provided by operating investing and financing activities or other income or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with gaap ebitda is widely used by investors and other users of the company s financial statements as a supplemental financial measure that when viewed with gaap results and the accompanying reconciliations the company believes ebitda provides additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting its ability to service debt pay deferred taxes and fund drydocking charges and other maintenance capital expenditures the company also believes the disclosure of ebitda helps investors meaningfully evaluate and compare its cash flow generating capacity from quarter to quarter and year to year ebitda is also a financial metric used by management i as a supplemental internal measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations ii as a significant criteria for annual incentive cash bonuses paid to the company s executive officers and other shore based employees iii to compare to the ebitda of other companies when evaluating potential acquisitions and iv to assess the company s ability to service existing fixed charges and incur additional indebtedness in addition the company has also historically made certain adjustments as applicable to ebitda for losses on early extinguishment of debt stock based compensation expense and interest income or adjusted ebitda to internally evaluate its performance based on the computation of ratios used in certain financial covenants of its credit agreements with various lenders the company believes that such ratios can at times be material components of financial covenants and when applicable failure to comply with such covenants could result in the acceleration of indebtedness or the imposition of restrictions on the company s financial flexibility set forth below are the material limitations associated with using ebitda as a non gaap financial measure compared to cash flows provided by operating activities ebitda does not reflect the future capital expenditure requirements that may be necessary to replace the company s existing vessels as a result of normal wear and tear ebitda does not reflect the interest future principal payments and other financing related charges necessary to service the debt that the company has incurred in acquiring and constructing its vessels ebitda does not reflect the deferred income taxes that the company will eventually have to pay once it is no longer in an overall tax net operating loss position as applicable and ebitda does not reflect changes in the company s net working capital position management compensates for the above described limitations in using ebitda as a non gaap financial measure by only using ebitda to supplement the company s gaap results 11 commercial related downtime results from commercial related vessel improvements such as the addition of cranes rovs helidecks living quarters and other specialized vessel equipment the modification of vessel capacities or capabilities such as dp upgrades and mid body extensions which costs are typically included in and offset in whole or in part by higher dayrates charged to customers and the speculative relocation of vessels from one geographic market to another 12 the capital expenditure amounts included in this table are anticipated cash outlays before the allocation of construction period interest as applicable 13 as of february 13 2019 the company s inactive fleet of 36 new generation osvs that were stacked was comprised of the following eleven 200 class osvs twenty two 240 class osvs and three 265 class osvs 14 the low and high ends of the guidance ranges set forth in this table are not intended to cover unexpected variations from currently anticipated market conditions these ranges provide only a reasonable deviation from the conditions that are expected to occur 15 the company s forward guidance for general and administrative expense includes an estimate of stock based compensation expense for outstanding equity settled and cash settled awards such expense for outstanding cash settled awards is re measured quarterly based on a 10 day trailing average stock price prior to each quarter end as of december 31 2018 the 10 day trailing average stock price was 1 54 per share future increases or decreases in such average stock price can be highly volatile and will commensurately impact stock based compensation expense and thus g a expense as cash settled awards are required to be marked to market with cumulative catch up adjustments at each quarter end 16 interest on the company s first lien term loan is variable based on changes in libor or the london interbank offered rate the guidance included in this press release related to such facility is based on industry estimates of libor in future periods as of february 13 2019 actual results may differ from this estimate interest expense on all of the company s other funded debt is fixed at rates set forth in the indentures governing such notes 17 represents incremental imputed non cash oid interest expense required by accounting standards pertaining to the company s 1 500 convertible senior notes due 2019 18 represents the non cash recognition of the 20 7 million gain on the debt for debt exchange associated with the company s first lien term loan and the 19 7 million gain on the debt for debt exchange associated with the company s second lien term loan such amounts are being deferred and amortized prospectively as yield adjustments to interest expense as required by gaap under debt modification accounting 19 projected weighted average diluted shares do not reflect any potential dilution resulting from the company s 1 500 convertible senior notes warrants related to the company s 1 500 convertible senior notes become dilutive when the average price of the company s stock exceeds the

job creation and farmers welfare are among the key contemporary challenges of our country thanks to the make in india campaign more than 120 new manufacturing units have created about 4 50 000 jobs in the mobile phone industry over the past four years similarly a new agriculture export policy envisages the establishment of agro specific zones to enable farmers to gain from international markets undoubtedly attention is being focused on these critical issues which will help us to move forward according to the international trade centre s database in 2017 india s exports grew to 480 billion an impressive 14 per cent growth over the previous year the highest in the past six years this was a result of sector specific interventions and focused export promotion initiatives indeed this performance has come in the midst of challenging times our current account deficit cad is widening rupee is depreciating rising interest rates in the united states are causing large capital outflows and trade protectionism around the world is on the increase while the government is mindful of these difficulties the tendency to overestimate them must be restrained moreover some of these are external factors beyond our control the situation today is quite different from 2012 13 wherein our cad was over four per cent of the gross domestic product gdp and inflation was close to 10 per cent today our cad is around 2 5 per cent of gdp and retail inflation is around four per cent that said we need to prepare a cogent strategy for structural changes to leverage india s trade competitiveness which should take into account the dynamic global realities and should be cognisant of our strengths limitations and available resources such a strategy needs to be both outward and inward looking in the sense that our engagement with external trade partners is informed by reforms in domestic markets and vice versa first we need to focus our negotiating and implementing capital on executing and benefiting from preferential trade agreements with select countries and regional blocs the objective is to focus on a few existing and unexplored markets getting market access and penetration in value chains product specific tariff and non tariff measures should be negotiated to boost our exports emphasis should be on ensuring zero or the least possible effective rate of protection for indian exports to these markets second challenges in the domestic regulatory environment affecting india s trade with select countries and regional blocs in specific products are to be identified and addressed targeted export promotion initiatives for boosting supply should be put in place there should be a greater emphasis on economic and commercial diplomacy by india s foreign missions particularly in select countries and regional blocs such an approach of dedicated trade promotion with consistent internal reforms will further help in exploring new markets this will require greater convergence between our trade and industrial policies already some initiatives are under way we should focus on 12 champion services sectors which are to be promoted both at the domestic and the global level there should be effective utilisation of a dedicated fund of 5 000 crores which has been set aside to help these sectors grow significantly initiatives to promote tourism a big jobs generator by facilitating an ecosystem which can attract tourists and has served well should be undertaken third there is a need to capture the space created by trade protection measures adopted globally particularly by the united states and china we should focus on exporting to the us such products whose imports from china and other countries have been recently subjected to higher tariffs simultaneously specific copanies should be attracted to make products in india through foreign direct investment joint ventures technology transfers and value chains for further export to the us and other countries to benefit from a favourable tariff regime in other words we should identify countries and sectors in which we possess a competitive tariff advantage and attract investments for exports however we should be mindful that several other countries may also possess a similar advantage and would compete with us in attracting investments consequently such creative trade creation will require several internal reforms in tandem of which rationalising transaction costs and addressing igst refund woes will be the key fourth we need to review incentives provided to boost exports particularly from special economic zones sezs out of the 420 approved sezs only 223 were operational as of july 2018 according to our recently concluded study on export oriented fdi into india and sezs key issues faced by sez operators include inconsistent and unpredictable taxation limited incentives to expand and duplication of procedures considering the increasing share of sezs in indian exports domestic as well as foreign investment needs to be facilitated by eliminating unnecessary barriers to this end we should come out with a revamped sez policy fifth we need to reorient our subsidy schemes and make them globally acceptable for instance direct export subsidies to producers should be replaced with export incentives in collateral areas such as transportation and other logistics which can lead to reduced costs simultaneously internal reforms for increasing competition in domestic agriculture markets particularly the procurement market are required as practised in other sectors there is a need to reorient subsidies from producers to consumers in agriculture last but not the least india supports reforms at the world trade organisation wto trade multilateralism is still the best bet for us and reforms in the wto s dispute settlement and other functions are essential we need to dispassionately work with the european union and china on reforming the wto to identify elements worthy of our support india should take the lead in reforming the wto and ensure that it continues to be an engine for global trade keeping in mind its development dimensions to conclude the current global trade scenario presents before us many challenges but also several opportunities for innovation collaboration and to grow our exports central and state governments will have to work together to make the most of these opportunities the suggested multi pronged approach can help us to leverage our export competitiveness to turn aspirations into reality
venezuela in the limelight on practically all the written audio and visual mainstream media as well as alternative media a purposeful constant drip of outright lies and half truths â fake newsâ as well as misleading information of all shades and hues about venezuela is drumming our brains slowly bending our minds towards believing that â yes the us has a vital interest in meddling in venezuela and bringing about â regime changeâ because of primarily the huge reserves of oil but also of gold coltan and other rare minerals and finally simply because washington needs full control of its â backyardâ â but and yes there is a huge but as even some of the respected progressive alternative media pretend to know amidst all that recognition of the anglozionist empireâ s evil hands in venezuela their â butâ claims that venezuela specifically presidents chavez and now maduro are not blameless in their â economic chaosâ this distorts already the entire picture and serves the empire and all those who are hesitant because they have no clue whom to support in this antagonistic us attempt for regime change for example one alternative news article starts â it is true that some of venezuelaâ s economic problems are due to the ineptitudes of the bolivarian governmentâ s â socialist commandâ economy but this overlooks the role played by the united states the united nations and the european unionâ â bingo with such a low blow beginning the uninformed reader is already primed to â discountâ much of the interference by washington and its minions some of the so called progressive writers have already been brain smeared by calling nicolã s maduro a â dictatorâ when in fact there is hardly any country farther away from a dictatorship than venezuela in the last 20 years and since comandante hugo chavez frias was first elected in 1998 and came to power in 1999 venezuela had another 25 fully democratic elections of which 6 took place in the last year and a half they were all largely observed by the us based carter institute the latin american celac some were even watched by the european union eu the very vassal states that are now siding with washington in calling president maduro an illegitimate dictator â and instead they support the real illegitimate never elected us cia trained and appointed juan guaidã³ former president carter once said of all the elections he and his institute observed the ones in venezuela were by far the most transparent and democratic ones by september 2017 the carter center had observed 104 elections in 39 countries despite this evidence washington paid and corrupted anglozionist msm are screaming and spreading lies â election fraudâ and nicolã s maduro is illegal a dictator oppressing his people depriving them of food and medication sowing famine â he has to go such lies are repeated at nauseatum in a world flooded by pyramid dollars fake money the presstitute media have no money problem dollars the funding source for the massive lie propaganda are just printed as debt never to be repaid again so why worry the same zionists who control the media also control the western money machines i e the fed wall street the bis bank for international settlement the so called central bank of central banks the european central bank the bank of england and the banks of london the western public armchair warriors all the way to caviar socialists believe these lies thatâ s how our unqualified brains apparently work a recent independent poll found that 86 of all venezuelans including from the opposition want no interference by the us and her puppet allies but want to remain a sovereign state deciding themselves on how to resolve their internal problem â economics and otherwise let me tell you something if mr maduro would be a dictator â and all the diabolical adjectives that he is smeared with were to apply he would have long ago stopped the western propaganda machine which is the western controlled media in venezuela they control 90 of the news in venezuela but he didnâ t and doesnâ t because he believes in freedom of speech and freedom of the â mediaâ â even if the â mediaâ are really nothing more than abject western lie machine presstitute mr maduro is generous enough not to close them down â which any dictator â of which there are now many in latin america take your pick argentina chile ecuador brazil colombia paraguay uruguay guatemala hondurasâ would have done long ago from the very beginning when hugo chavez was first elected in 1998 washington attempted to topple him to bring about â rã gime changeâ the first real coup attempt took place on 11 april 2002 under full command by washington chavez was ousted for less than 2 days when an on swell of people and the vast majority of the military requested his reinstatement chavez was brought back from his island seclusion and thus the directly washington led coup dâ ã tat was defeated â the revolution will not be televisedâ but the pressure mounted with economic sanctions becoming ever bolder and in the case of venezuela they had severe economic and humanitarian impacts because venezuela imports close to 90 of her food and medication â still today â and most of it from the us both chavez and maduro had very little leeway of doing differently what they have already done sanctions boycotts outside money manipulations driving inflation to astronomical levels and constant smear propaganda these predicaments are biting hard the us has a firm grip on venezuelaâ s dollar dependency last week washington confiscated about us 23 billion of venezuelaâ s reserve money in us banks blocked them from use by the legitimate maduro government and instead handed them to their us appointed puppet never elected â presidentâ juan guaidã³ â he is now able to use venezuelaâ s money in his us eu and lima group supported â shadowâ government will he dare â i donâ t think so however he has already invited us petrol companies to come to venezuela and invest in and take over the petrol industry of course it will not happen as president maduro stays in power firmly backed by the military all of this sounds like a bad joke did you ever hear of juan guaidã³ before the us and her european vassals almost unanimously and obediently aped washington in supporting him likewise the bank of england withheld 1 2 billion dollarsâ worth of venezuelan reserve gold refusing to respond to the maduro governmentâ s request to return the gold to caracas both cases represent an extreme breach of confidence up to now it was ethically commercially and financially unthinkable that reserve money and gold deposited in foreign banks would not be safe from hooligan theft â because thatâ s what it is what the us is doing stealing other countries money that was deposited in good fate in their banks in a recent interview with rt president maduro said there was absolutely no need for â humanitarian aidâ as the un suggested prompted by the us this so called humanitarian aid has everywhere in the world only served to infiltrate â foreign and destabilizingâ elements into countries just look at syria libya iraq afghanistan to name just a few while the us 23 billion blocked in new york banks could have supplied venezuela with 20 years worth of medication for the venezuelan people maduro asserted venezuela has enough liquidity to feed and medicate her people however what this latest trump plunder the money and gold confiscation does is hammering one more nail in the western monetary systemâ s suicide coffin it sends an ever clearer signal to the rest of the world to those that havenâ t noticed yet the anglozionist empire cannot â i repeat â cannot â be trusted ever and the european union is intrinsically and â vassalicallyâ linked to the washington rogue state â not to be trusted either there is virtually no circumstance under which a countriesâ assets in western foreign lands â as bank deposits or foreign investments â are safe it will prompt a move away from the dollar system away from the western also entirely privately owned swft international transfer system by which sanctions can be enacted indeed the russia and china and much of the sco shanghai organization cooperation members are no longer dealing in us dollars but in their own currencies we are talking about half the worldâ s population broke free from the dollar hegemony europe has started a half assed attempt to circumvent the dollar and swift system for dealing with iran europeâ s special purpose vehicle or spv is called instex â short for instrument in support of trade exchanges it is a project of germany france and the uk suspiciously chaired by the latter to be endorsed by all 28 eu members it aims in a first instance at shipping â humanitarian aidâ to iran similarly to venezuela iranâ s foreign minister javad zarif after learning about the details considered the conditions of instex as insulting and rejected any dealings with europe under this system iran he said does not need â humanitarian aidâ not from europe not from anybody in the meantime what was to be expected has already happened the trump administration issued a stern warning of â sanctionsâ to the eu if they would attempt to deal with iran outside of the dollar system europe is likely caving in as they always do back in venezuela the ned national endowment for democracy the extended arm of the cia has for the last two decades trained funded and infiltrated â traitorâ agents into venezuela with the goal to assist the opposition to foment unrest to carry out assassinations and other â false flagsâ and to simply create chaos and unrest however some of these agents are also lodged in venezuelaâ s financial institutions as the fifth column where they sabotage â often with threats â any economic policies that could rescue venezuela from its economic predicament in june 2017 i was privileged to be a member of an economic advisory team to mr maduro during three days of intense discussions with government a number of potential short medium and long term solutions emerged they were well received by mr maduro and his economic team what became of these recommendations â well maybe there are strong foreign directed forces at play to prevent their implementation clearly any accusation that the maduro government may bear the blame for some of the economic chaos have to be vigorously rejected mr maduro has very little space to maneuver the economy other than what he is already doing his actions are severely limited by the ever stronger squeeze by western claws with or without venezuelaâ s new crypto currency the oil based petro the venezuelan economy including a major proportion of her imports is strongly linked to the us dollar with military threats and sanctions left and right there is little that the government can do in the immediate future to become autonomous yes russia and especially china will most likely help with balance of payment support loans with investments in the oil industry to ease venezuelaâ s us dollar debt burden and vamp up oil production and in the medium and longer run they may also help boosting venezuelaâ s agricultural sector towards 100 food self sufficiency what is the real reason you may ask behind trumpâ s intense â coup dâ ã tatâ attempt â aka bolton pompeo and elliott abrams the â regime changeâ envoy or the diabolical troikaâ s killer mission is it oil and other natural riches like gold coltan diamonds and many more rare minerals venezuela with some 301 000 mmbbl billions of barrels of known reserves has about 12 more hydrocarbon reserves than saudi arabia shipping from the gulf to texas refineries takes 40 45 days and the risk of passing through the iran controlled strait of hormuz delivering oil from venezuela to texas takes some 2 4 days is it that venezuela committed a mortal sin when circumventing the petro dollar when trading her hydrocarbons notably with china and russia in other currencies like the gold convertible yuan â remember saddam hussein and muamar gadhafi attempted similar dollar escaping actions â and look what it brought them the us dollar hegemony depends very much on oil and gas trade in us dollars as per an agreement of the seventies between the us and saudi arabia head of opec is it that washington cannot tolerate any socialist or socialist leaning country in its â backyardâ â cuba and nicaragua beware is venezuela a crucial stepping stone to fully dominate latin america and her resources â and hence a step closer to â full power dominanceâ of the world or all of the above now letâ s cut to the chase â it is clear that the trump administration with these stupid actions of dishing out sanctions left and right punishing allies and foes alike if they deal with russia iran or venezuela â and this special blunt regime change aggression in venezuela nominating a 35 year old us puppet trained in the us by cia as venezuelaâ s new â interim presidentâ confiscating venezuelaâ s reserve assets in new york and london stopping importing petrol from venezuela and punishing anybody who imports venezuelan oil â except of course russia and china the â mightâ of the us stops short of interfering in these non dollar deals with these and more ridiculous actions and military threats â washington is actually not only isolating itself but is accelerating the fall of the us economy ever more countries are seeking alternative ways of doing business with currencies and monetary systems other than the dollar based fraudulent swift and eventually they will succeed all they need to do is joining the china russia sco system of transfer in their local currencies and the currencies of the eastern sco block â and dedollarization is moving a step further ahead dedollarization is the key to the end of the us dollar hegemony of the us economic supremacy the arrogant trump plus the impunity of the unfettered diabolical and outright dumb bolton pompeo abrams approach of military threats and intimidations may just make venezuela the straw that breaks the empireâ s back source url i believe itâ s all of the above with a strong accent on venezuelaâ s abandoning the us dollar as hydrocarbon trading currency â putting the dollar hegemony even more at risk once the dollar ceases to be the main reserve currency the us economy will slowly collapse â what it is already doing twenty years ago the us dollar dominated world reserve coffers with about 90 today that proportion has sunk to less than 60 the dollar is rapidly being replaced by other currencies notably the chinese yuan now letâ s cut to the chase â it is clear that the trump administration with these stupid actions of dishing out sanctions left and right punishing allies and foes alike if they deal with russia iran or venezuela â and this special blunt regime change aggression in venezuela nominating a 35 year old us puppet trained in

gov janet mills joins us for a conversation about her newly released budget her priorities her recent cabinet picks and how the job is going since her inauguration last month guest gov janet mills is the 75th governor of maine a member of the democratic party and maine s former attorney general she was sworn in as governor in jan 2019 transcript this transcript has been edited for clarity jennifer rooks gov mills welcome back to maine calling although you ve been on the program several times this is the first time as governor from your perspective is the job so far what you thought it would be janet mills i m having a lot of fun the first task was putting together a government putting together a cabinet and we ve had 14 out of the 15 cabinet members confirmed sworn in qualified and working their tails off of course at the same time we re doing a budget and i was really privileged to have some people volunteer in that respect we had not only kirsten figueroa the new department of administration and financial services commissioner working on this budget but also ryan lowe who used to be the budget officer and used to be commissioner and now works for the university and jeremy fischer former chair of the appropriations committee and peggy rotundo and others really helping go over the backlog of requests from the various departments to determine which ones have the most merit and looking at the revenue forecast which is put together by an objective independent team of economists who meet twice a year and put together the revenue forecasts for the next couple of years and we base it all on that i know that there is a backlog of requests a lot of different constituents coming to you expecting something from you how did you choose your priorities in putting together this budget what i heard on the campaign trail were several things one is people were demanding better health care and lower health insurance rates big issues for business and for individuals across the state of maine secondly i heard a lot about education people want to have more state support for k 12 education people want more emphasis on early childhood education including head start and pre k and cds the child development services because we all know that one thing that contributes to for instance the opioid epidemic and inability to finish school are things like adverse childhood experiences the way we address those things early on is to have appropriate and informed child care and head start services and pre k available not mandated but optional for 4 year olds to be able to socialize and even on a half day basis be able to have some instructional benefits cds of course kicks in at infancy and for young kids who need special services so we want to support all those needs so really using the information you learned from the campaign trail informed your priorities sure and the opioid epidemic is something i had been dealing with for six years in particular as attorney general it impacted every aspect of our work as attorney general it impacted licensing regulatory issues the medical examiner s office the criminal division natural resources when it comes to disposal of drugs and whatnot the health care crimes unit so we ve been looking at that even child protection and child support matters people not being able to pay child support because they re spending the money on drugs and keeping tabs on the overdose death statistics from one year to the next we know from attorney general aaron frye s release earlier this week that 282 people died in the first nine months of last year from drug overdose that is exactly one a day basically so it s an ongoing epidemic that we ve got to address this budget depends on strong revenue a strong economy it s an 11 percent increase over the last budget and the republicans are already questioning its sustainability i m sure you ve already heard it over and over again what do you say to them i m happy to carry on a long dialogue with them over the next few months as i pointed out in the budget address last night this budget is sustainable the budget estimates the figures are based on the revenue forecasting commission i didn t appoint them they weren t appointed by me they re part and parcel of the prior administration they re experts in their area including the state economist and nonpartisan individuals they put together a revenue forecast that anticipates in the out years never mind this coming biennium but the following biennium they forecast 8 3 billion in revenues to be available just general fund revenues so this budget is much less than that and it takes into account no new taxes there no gimmicks there are no negative balances we re not playing around with moving things from one year to the next as sometimes happens and we re preserving the 270 odd million stabilization fund or the rainy day fund we re not touching that we proposed not to touch that because i think it is important like most people in their own budgets you try to have savings available in case of a downturn in case of something untoward happening in this case i feel pretty confident about maine s economic future the housing starts have been pretty stable in the last couple of years construction sales are stable revenue from sales taxes especially during the height of tourist season are very good and income taxes and corporate taxes are good some of that depends on how the new federal tax law plays out but the federal reserve has promised not to increase interest rates again this year if they do so next year that could cause some problems in terms of bonding and in terms of homeowners and mortgage rates and that kind of thing so we re keeping money in reserve in case of a downturn however slight and i think that s an appropriate thing to do your predecessor gov paul lepage said yesterday that you spend money like a drunken sailor would you care to respond no the budget as you know because you were a legislator has to go through a process now and you know it ll change and i m wondering if there are any items any priorities in your budget that you view as nonnegotiable is there something that if it s not there if the budget doesn t have this you re going to veto it no we re not at that stage yet i ll tell you the priorities that i outlined last night will remain pretty much the same more funding for education from the state we put 126 million on the table here for additional state funds for k 12 through the essential programs and services formula that s a lot of additional funds for the state s share for education that alone would bring us up to almost 51 percent state funding for education through the formula statewide the other thing is the opioid epidemic and this doesn t take that much money it takes a concentration takes a focus and it takes prioritization right now without any additional funds any additional taxpayer dollars we ve identified several million dollars in funds that are currently sitting at the department of health and human services federal money that has not been allocated that should be and will be allocated to purchasing narcan for instance and hiring recovery coaches and going into the schools and starting new prevention and education programs and figuring out what works and what perhaps doesn t work and engaging the communities because it s got to be an all out community effort if we re to seriously address this epidemic what is the timeline on that the federal funds that you talked about last night in your budget address that you would like maine to be able to draw down i m sure there are deadlines for those and a process are these funds that we will see soon or is this something we re going to be looking at in 2020 all of the above some of the funds that have been turned away in the past such as forest legacy program money several hundred thousand dollars for alzheimer s identification treatment and diagnosis several hundred thousand dollars for colorectal cancer screening tests with no state match in many of these cases money for childhood hunger and childhood diseases that s money that is owed us that our people paid in people in maine paid federal taxes and that money instead of coming back to maine is going to other states instead so why would we turn it away they all have different time frames and i ll be working closely with the congressional delegation be meeting with them at the end of next week to determine what we can do how we can better draw down federal funds for instance broadband connect america funds will be available i want to make sure maine gets its fair share of that because we have some of the highest needs for expanding broadband we have a dispersed population and we have those funky peninsulas very hard to lay fiber along those lines so we want federal money for that federal money for health care needs antiterrorism needs public safety and roads i signed one document a couple of weeks ago that had not been signed previously to draw down 13 million in federal funds for roads is there anything now that you re in the blaine house and sitting in the governor s office that you didn t expect to come over your desk that has is there any priority that s something that s maybe not being talked about in the headlines but in your view will emerge as a major issue in maine that s a pretty tough question nothing jumps off the page right now the view is different you know i think when you put on the mantle of the governorship it s a whole different ballgame than assuming the position of attorney general or any other executive or public position it s a whole different thing i went to a funeral recently of a very prominent individual a very caring and influential person and i got to say to the family you know it s not just me janet mills expressing sympathy i express sympathy and condolences on behalf of the 1 3 million people in the state of maine whom he served in various capacities and it s a whole different thing to represent the people of the state of maine not just yourself or an agency or a particular part of government you re representing the people there s a lawsuit going on against aroostook county and particularly the prison about medication assisted treatment there mat i know that you have issued guidance to maine state prison s system about medication assisted treatment encouraging the prisons i don t want to put words in your mouth but encouraging the warden and prison to look into incorporating this for people who come to prison with addictions what is your point of view of what the county jails need to be doing at this point again you don t have jurisdiction but have been attorney general and a district attorney i don t want to comment on any pending lawsuits or any litigation i know the penobscot county jail has made available something called vivitrol which is a 30 day effective suboxone type medication and with after care and i ll credit my my predecessor for helping out with that for providing the funds for the penobscot county jail to start out a medication assisted release program i ve talked to the governor of rhode island gina raimondo my commissioner of corrections randy liberty and the commissioner of hhs and the commissioner of public safety michael sauschuck have all been talking to rhode island and seeing how we can duplicate what they have done in their jails they have what appears to be a very effective release program if somebody is in jail and has a substance use disorder which proximately 75 percent of inmates statewide and nationwide have then they can before their release date are given medication assisted treatments suboxone and the like and released with that program and with wraparound services here s some help getting a job here s some help getting housing in someplace where you might not fall back in with a crowd you were in before that kind of thing and they ve reduced the recidivism rate to a large extent and they ve reduced the relapse rate of those with substance use disorder we have drug courts five and going on six now and they re pretty effective that way too but we want to get the people who are incarcerated and make sure that we help them recover too it s a boon to society as a whole and a boon to them as well in western maine cmp and hydro quebec are working on a new deal they say will offer at least a quarter of a billion dollars in new value to maine including reduced electricity rates for all maine ratepayers and help for low income residents can you support the project if it provides these benefits looking at the details i think they have not yet been ironed out in general what i have said and i continue to say is that i want to see substantial environmental mitigation i want to see help for the sportsmen and women who are seeing a lessening of the deer wintering areas and things of that sort i want to see help for ratepayers i want to see efforts towards increasing access and availability of community and residential solar i want to see access to broadband and all those things are on the table and so i m happy with the progress that is being made and i m anxious to see the details so what you ve seen before doesn t satisfy that yet i haven t seen the precise details i like the progress that they re making and i like the subject areas they re addressing electric vehicles for instance and electric vehicle charging stations all over maine i can see that happening and i appreciate and welcome their help in that regard i know that you have announced you d like to have a new cabinet level position for energy do you know who that person is i m sorry i regret that i can t make that announcement are you hoping that the legislature can pass this budget by april i m hoping they pass and i get to sign a two thirds budget on or before june 30 i definitely want this to be a bipartisan budget audience member harold hello gov mills i m impressed with what you ve been saying but i just want to see what your thoughts are regarding the issues of older mainers including things like drug costs or drug information their food insecurity or even information or getting things out regarding better qualities and diet and in general what you what your thoughts and concerns are a couple of things in the budget that you might be interested in are the fact that we re putting more funds behind the drug for maine s elderly program and the medicare savings plan which have been kind of depleted the last 10 years when i was on the appropriations committee for four years we worked on that quite assiduously and we want to replenish those funds to help maine seniors who don t qualify for any of the specific medicare drug benefits plans to help them with their drug costs i think it s appalling how drug companies around the world are increasing their prices especially for americans we help subsidize the research and then we see them spend billions each year advertising on tv and quite frankly i m most particularly annoyed with the sackler family and those who distributed and marketed opioids for the wrong reasons and with the wrong marketing and got people basically hooked on these drugs but in addition i ve been working with sen eloise vitelli for a couple of years on a drug transparent price transparency bill and we re going to continue to work on that too audience member lance in addition to the much needed tobacco prevention control funding increase included in the proposed budget what other measures does the governor support to address the youth e cigarette epidemic now let s be clear these are products that are not clean they re not clear of nicotine they actually contain nicotine some of the statistics we ve seen recently show that about 20 percent of all seniors in high school have regularly smoked or inhaled e cigs and engaged in what s called vaping this is more than annoying it s troublesome because of the nicotine in those products the producers of many of them are owned by tobacco companies the intent of getting kids hooked on these apparatus is to get them hooked on nicotine and ultimately stay hooked on nicotine take up cigarettes cigars and cigarillos and we know the devastating health consequences to that so public education cessation products for those who are already hooked on nicotine we have a very high rate of tobacco use in maine and we haven t addressed it successfully when the fund for healthy maine was invented about 20 years ago we developed purposes for that money we re going to go back to some of the original purposes for that money and include tobacco cessation and nicotine prevention and cessation in those funds audience member charlie i m calling about mentally ill people who unfortunately sometimes become violent and in maine and across the country they are housed in our jails and prisons and not getting treatment i think we pretty much know that mentally ill people will not be violent if properly treated my specific question is would you take the money that lepage set aside for a new forensic psychiatric facility and put it back into treatment centers where people can be taken by the police instead of to an e r or jail that s an interesting concept and i know there is some legislation pending to set up crisis centers around the state i haven t seen the details i think the idea is good but then again you ve got civil liberties interests at stake here how do you keep somebody behind bars whether it s a crisis stabilization unit or jail without proper due process we don t want to go back to the days of institutionalization of people simply because of their mental illness but i agree with you that a high proportion of people in prisons and jails right now have some form of mental illness that has gone untreated i would like to see more services in the jails and in the correctional facilities of the state whether we take that money from the stepdown facility is an open question i think that we re looking at the details of the stepdown facility right now because we also have a high need to address the forensic patients in riverview and some of whom are being housed at dorothea dix now it s a separate problem but equally serious and i want to make sure we do the right thing by them and by their families and make sure that they are successfully treated so they can re enter society at an appropriate time audience member leigh i want to say how proud i am to finally have a woman in this leadership position in our state and i think you ve done some great things right off the bat your selection for the head of decf i think is awesome as i understand it you re going to be supporting the office of outdoor recreation which i think will do so many wonderful things for our state so thank you for all of that one thing that i was disappointed in thus far was your selection of jerry reid and i wondered if you would speak to why you thought that he was the best person for that position even though you knew that the tribes likely would not support him i think the issues about the tribes were pretty well aired during his committee hearing and i think we had to disabuse some misinformation at that point too he was misquoted in a federal court hearing and he set the record straight there he s had a good relationship with a lot of people and it s significant to me that most of the environmental community came out and supported him and many of the businesses approved of him and the committee supported them i think it was unanimous 11 0 so he s a real genuine guy he s very thoughtful he s very intelligent and he knows environmental law and regulation and that s an extremely important position i wanted somebody with good common sense and judgment and preferably legal background which he has and knowledge of the environmental laws and regulations federal and state he s taken on the federal government he s been part of the lawsuits against the federal government when they try to roll back the mercury and airborne toxics rule for instance and that s a lot of what s poisoning our waterways in maine we need to join the tribes in those kinds of fights and we are doing that rooks there are several related questions just about the relationship with the tribes in the state what s your gameplan for trying to improve relations a lot depends on the different tribes the individual tribes there are four different ones as you know and one with two different reservations and i think their needs are all different i don t pretend to tell them what they want or what they should expect from state government but we have the dialogue going we have that conversation going conversation that i really did not have an opportunity to engage in as attorney general because we were on the other side of some litigation and they have legal counsel the penobscots do anyway we did assist the passamaquoddy tribe in some respects and now opening up the dialogue is important i have much broader authority and jurisdiction and ability to an opportunity to talk with the tribes about various issues as we go along i was pleased to choose donna loring as our liaison with the tribes and she s going to do a lot of traveling around the state meeting with different tribal councils and finding out where they re at on different issues we have a lot to work together on the opioid epidemic alone it is distressing to hear that in one reservation alone there were two opioid overdose deaths in just a matter of weeks recently we want to work together on those kinds of issues audience member alberto how come we don t have school resource officers at every single high school i like the idea of school resource officers a lot depends on the local school district and the local police departments and county sheriff s offices to see how they can afford to have a part time or full time school resource officer in some cities they have them in the lower grades and middle schools and high schools but i think that s pretty rare mostly they re in the high schools and i think they re most effective in the middle schools and high schools but we want to develop better community relationships between the police departments and the schools and make sure we have an open dialogue between students and police officers in every community funding that is a whole different ballgame and the governor is not really in a position to say we re going to fund a school resource person in every school there s just too many schools and too many police departments who are strapped for cash we are authorizing the hiring of 15 additional troopers and sergeants for the maine state police so they are going to be available especially in the rural areas have a 24 hour presence just for the regular duties of law enforcement that in itself is challenging audience member mary with our aging population do you have any ideas on how to not only keep young people in the state but entice other young people to move here can we get rid of the idea that maine is just a vacationland but it s a place people will want to move to and stay great idea and we heard a lot about that on the campaign trail last year i ve been talking a lot about that exact same thing i feel like the office of the governor is a couple things one is you re a manager you re administrator you re running a budget you re trying to support things a budget is sometimes a statement of values and in this budget we do put money behind the university system and the community colleges and maine maritime academy we do put some money behind broadband my new decd commissioner heather johnson is remarkably adept at identifying federal monies and managing state monies so as to market the whole state of maine not just as a tourism destination but as a place where families should come and live work and play and work remotely or start a new business that s our gameplan i just want to be the biggest cheerleader for the state of maine i want to tell the world what a great place we are what great people we have with a great work ethic and what incredible unmatched natural resources i think people will come here audience member david you have spoken of climate change as a priority so i m wondering what initiatives you are creating to address it especially the erosion of our beaches and threats to the shoreline some years ago the legislature authorized a study on ocean acidification and we ve been talking a lot about the rising seas but we ve done nothing about it and i think one of the items we ve got to look at is community resilience and increasing the resiliency of our coastal communities i know there are legislators like rep lydia bloom and others who are very intent on taking action in that regard we re going to be putting together a climate change and energy cabinet to look at a myriad of issues we know that the gulf of maine is changing a great deal that the lobster population has shifted that cod fisheries have depleted that the herring fisheries are essentially closed down and that we re looking at new ways of farming oysters and scallops we re looking at diversifying our aquaculture and our agricultural interests but climate change is a big factor all around and what i ve decided is i want every single department of state government to be looking at climate change department of education department of transportation health and human services all of them but the oceans issue is a real big one obviously for a lot of reasons and erosion is a major one our dep commissioner jerry reed will also be looking at that too audience member riley i was once fresh from the army and moved to maine i worked at the distribution center for shaw s and as a cable guy in wells i made more money washing dishes when i moved to seattle the minimum wage is too low and that is why young people can t live in maine they risk spinning their wheels never getting to a point where a millennial like me can buy a home i think that efforts in the last few years in particular to increase the minimum wage have been successful it is going up every year then there s an indexing that kicks in i think after next year but i think equally important is what you take home from your paycheck and that means cost of living and benefits packages that is health insurance and leave policies things of that sort that are very important to employees and employers one of my goals is to help small businesses find adequate and affordable health insurance for their employees because if you re taking home 30 000 40 000 a year but you re paying 6 000 a year for health insurance that takes a big chunk of change out of your pocket and out of things you could be spending money on to buy a car to put money into a home or rent an apartment and that kind of thing so we want to look at both ends of the spectrum the wage is one thing the benefits is another and they re equally important audience member dick i haven t heard anyone talk about land for maine s future and development of the state parks and wondering what you ve got in the budget for those two items land for maine s future generally comes under bond issues and we ve reserved money for interest payments in the budget for the biennial coming up for payment toward a bond that would include land for maine s future we did not propose a specific amount but clearly that s a priority when the people are given the opportunity to vote on land for maine s future bonds they overwhelmingly accept them and vote them in so i think that s an important indicator of the public support for land for maine s future and yes they will be meeting yes i will encourage my commissioners take part in those meetings and i m particularly interested in waterfront access too that s one of the things that land for maine s future can allot money toward and ties in with the previous question about coastal communities too audience member ed restoring river herring passage on maine s rivers most now are dammed there has been a crash in cod and atlantic herring stocks river herring passage can help bring back atlantic salmon and cod could you please help make sure that fish and eel passage will be improved on the union river and on all maine rivers that sounds like a commissioner of marine resources pat keliher question to me i m a fisherman i like fly fishing for you know for brookies and stuff but i m not up to date on the river herring issue and the union river in particular so i can t really comment but i love the question and i ll ask keliher what he thinks about that because i think that s in his jurisdiction audience member edward i had a question about voters and their trust lepage did a lot of bad things for voters trust with citizens initiatives i know you voted medicaid in right away when you got in but how else will you help to restore voters trust i guess i have to earn it i have to earn it every day i don t take anything for granted in this job i hope that the voters will know that i have an open door i want to hear from people i ll be going out to the communities in the next few weeks and months and listen to people around the state whether it s eastport dover foxcroft machias sanford etc all over the state because i want to talk to people on the ground i don t want to have my information about what maine people think distilled through lobbyists and experts and staffpeople i want to hear directly from the people that s one thing i can do i m trying to pay attention to them audience member dan an article in a new hampshire business magazine basically states that maine spends twice what new hampshire does on tourist marketing and i m just kind of curious how when we have so many talented ad agencies in maine maine has been sending tens of millions of dollars to wisconsin the people in wisconsin don t know maine as a political and economic refugee from franklin county i m please asking you to look into maine tourism that money can be better spent to help small family owned businesses in oxford franklin piscataquis and androscoggin counties i ll be happy to look at that now that we have a commissioner on board as of last week she s anxious to look at everything the department is doing too and somebody mentioned earlier the outdoor recreation position which is in decd right now and i love what carolann ouellette is doing there i want her and that department to work more closely with if w the fish and wildlife people and with agriculture conservation and forestry people because we want to break down those silos and make sure that we market maine appropriately the hunting population has diminished somewhat in the last few years too we want to make sure people know that maine is an excellent place to come to hunt and to fish to hike to enjoy the great outdoors i go to public parks in rangeley and greenville and all over the state of maine and people don t know that those parks are there i agree we should be marketing maine much more effectively audience member dixie i m interested in what the policies will be for people who are autistic or have intellectual disability i have a son who s 25 years old and has really struggled with the level of availability of services for what his need is the increase in autism is astounding and we don t really know why that s happening but i can tell you it s personal to me because i have a grandchild who has autism and he s aging out of the school system now and we know that the section 21 and section 29 waivers have had waitlists and we re addressing that in the budget commissioner jeanne lambrew is addressing that as best she can as well and it s a sticky problem for a lot of families all across the state of maine and dealing with it in the schools too it s not just hhs it s the department of education and local school districts having to deal with different levels of autism as you know it s not one set disease there s a spectrum and different children different adults have different needs so accommodating all those different needs but it s our responsibility as a government with public trust to address those needs and to make sure all our kids are taken care of and all of our adults with those issues i don t know if your son is in a work setting or going to dayhab or living in a residential facility but these are all challenges we re going to be looking at audience member emery i m an er physician i practice here in augusta and i m doing a fellowship in obesity medicine and i would tell you that about 90 percent of what i see in the e r is 100 percent preventable through lifestyle changes and a lot of our chronic disease is due to obesity by 2020 90 percent of the u s adult population will be overweight or obese and it really starts in childhood and i m wondering if there s anybody doing anything for getting processed food out of schools because we re seeing the childhood obesity rate is now one out of five children so we ve got kids who are going have heart attacks by the time they re in their 30s and i just don t see really a push and i appreciate all your work on the opiate epidemic but i see this as a much worse problem so i m just wondering there s thoughts on childhood nutrition in schools my sister has been involved in this dora mills used to be head of the cdc and in more recent years she developed a program for snap recipients i can t remember what it s called but to educate families who are getting food assistance about the best foods and how to cook them basic education in terms of the school lunch program i know the federal government has some kind of measures of low fat foods calorie sensitive meals things of that sort and i read in the paper just a couple weeks ago that they were thinking of paring that back and allowing more junk food in schools i don t like that i don t think we should be encouraging kids to eat junk foods and sodas that are replacement calories and don t do you any good so i agree with your priority i agree that obesity is a major problem i ll be thinking about it in the coming weeks and see if we can do something more about it at the state level i know people like craig hickman in the maine legislature have been pushing for more fruits and vegetables in the schools and more homegrown maine grown products from our own agricultural interests so good ideas and thank you for your insights i m amazed at your observations i guess they probably agree with mine anecdotally but to hear it from a professional dealing with it in the emergency room is pretty astounding audience member marpheen i know you love poetry me too how will you prioritize the arts in maine schools which helps with critical thinking something important in today s world of information overload and fake news i d like to see a comeback in the arts in schools too often the arts and music have taken a back seat to the programs that are more aligned with what we ve called learning results the things that kids are tested on a different levels of schooling and that s unfortunate i fully support the arts and music in the schools not sure what i can do as governor but i would support you to weigh in at your local school board school committee to make sure that they don t set aside the arts and music and that kind of education i feel strongly that literature and poetry are an important part of everybody s lives and should be because it helps us to see how other people live it helps us to see how others think and feel what s out there in ways that we can t do in the ordinary course of business in a day
china s growth rate remains impressive even if on the decline the country s continuing economic gains owe much to the chinese state s 1 still considerable ability to direct the activity of critical economic enterprises and sectors such as finance 2 commitment to policies of economic expansion and 3 flexibility in economic strategy it appears that china s leaders view their recently adopted one belt one road initiative as key to the country s future economic vitality however there are reasons to believe that this strategy is seriously flawed with working people including in china destined to pay a high price for its shortcomings chinese growth trends downward china grew rapidly over the decades of the 1980s 1990s and 2000s with production and investment increasingly powered by the country s growing integration into regional cross border production networks by 2002 china had become the world s biggest recipient of foreign direct investment and by 2009 it had overtaken germany to become the world s biggest exporter not surprisingly the great recession and the decline in world trade that followed represented a major challenge to the county s export oriented growth strategy the government s response was to counter the effects of declining external demand with a major investment program financed by massive money creation and low interest rates interest rates when a lends money to b b repays the amount lent by a the capital as well as a supplementary sum known as interest so that a has an interest in agreeing to this financial operation the interest is determined by the interest rate which may be high or low to take a very simple example if a borrows 100 million dollars for 10 years at a fixed interest rate of 5 the first year he will repay a tenth of the capital initially borrowed 10 million dollars plus 5 of the capital owed i e 5 million dollars that is a total of 15 million dollars in the second year he will again repay 10 of the capital borrowed but the 5 now only applies to the remaining 90 million dollars still due i e 4 5 million dollars or a total of 14 5 million dollars and so on until the tenth year when he will repay the last 10 million dollars plus 5 of that remaining 10 million dollars i e 0 5 million dollars giving a total of 10 5 million dollars over 10 years the total amount repaid will come to 127 5 million dollars the repayment of the capital is not usually made in equal instalments in the initial years the repayment concerns mainly the interest and the proportion of capital repaid increases over the years in this case if repayments are stopped the capital still due is higher the nominal interest rate is the rate at which the loan is contracted the real interest rate is the nominal rate reduced by the rate of inflation investment as a share share a unit of ownership interest in a corporation or financial asset representing one part of the total capital stock its owner a shareholder is entitled to receive an equal distribution of any profits distributed a dividend and to attend shareholder meetings of gdp gdp gross domestic product gross domestic product is an aggregate measure of total production within a given territory equal to the sum of the gross values added the measure is notoriously incomplete for example it does not take into account any activity that does not enter into a commercial exchange the gdp takes into account both the production of goods and the production of services economic growth is defined as the variation of the gdp from one period to another rose to an all time high of 48 percent in december 2011 and remains at over 44 percent of gdp but despite the government s efforts growth steadily declined from 10 6 in 2010 to 6 7 in 2016 before registering an increase of 6 9 in 2017 see the chart below current predictions are for a further decline in 2018 beginning in 2012 the chinese government began promoting the idea of a new normal centered around a target rate of growth of 6 5 the government claimed that the benefits of this new normal growth rate would include greater stability and a more domestically oriented growth process that would benefit chinese workers however in contrast to its rhetoric the state continued to pursue a high grow rate by promoting a massive state supported construction boom tied to a policy of expanded urbanization new roads railways airports shopping centers and apartment complexes were built as might be expected such a big construction push has left the country with excess facilities and infrastructure highlighted by a growing number of ghost towns as the south china morning post describes six skyscrapers overlooking a huge man made lake once seemed like a dazzling illustration of a city s ambition the transformation of desert on the edge of ordos in inner mongolia into a gleaming residential and commercial complex to help secure its future prosperity at noon on a cold winter s day the reality seemed rather different only a handful of people could be seen entering or exiting the buildings with hardly a trace of activity in the 42 storey skyscrapers the complex opened five years ago but just three of its buildings have been sold to the city government and another is occupied by its developer a bank and an energy company the remaining two are empty gates blocked and dust piled on the ground ordos however was just one project in china s rush to urbanize the nation used more cement in the three years from 2011 to 2013 than the united states used in the entire 20 th century century other mostly empty ghost towns can be found across china including the yujiapu financial district in tianjin the chenggong district in kunming in yunnan and yingkou in liaoning province this building boom was financed by a rapid increase in debt creating repayment concerns corporate debt in particular soared as shown below but local government and household debt also grew substantially the boom also caused several industries to dramatically increase their scale of production creating serious overcapacity problems as the researcher xin zhang points out over the past decade scholars and government officials have held a stable consensus that nine traditional industries in china are most severely exposed to the excess capacity problem steel cement plate glass electrolytic aluminium coal ship building solar energy wind energy and petrochemical all of these nine sectors are related to energy infrastructural construction and real estate development reflecting the nature of a heavily investment driven economy for china not surprisingly this situation has also led to a significant decline in economy wide rates of return according to xin zhang despite strong overall growth performance the capital return rate of the chinese economy has started to be on a sharp decline recently although the results vary by different estimation methods research in and outside china points out a recent downward trend for example two economists show that all through the 1980s and the first half of the 1990s the capital return rate of the chinese economy had been relatively stable at about 0 22 much higher than the u s counterpart however since the mid 1990s the capital return rate experienced more ups and downs until the dramatic drop to about 0 14 in 2013 since then the return to capital within chinese economy has decreased even further creating the phenomenon of a capital glut in other words it was becoming increasingly unlikely that the chinese state could stabilize growth pursuing its existing strategy in fact it appears that many wealthy chinese have decided that their best play is to move their money out of the country a china economic review article highlights this development chinese leaders were not blind to the mounting economic difficulties limits to domestic construction were apparent as was the danger that unused buildings and factories coupled with excess capacity in key industries could easily trigger widespread defaults on the part of borrowers and threaten the stability of the financial sector growing labor activism on the part of workers struggling with low salaries and dangerous working conditions added to their concern however despite earlier voiced support for the notion of a new normal growth tied to slower but more worker friendly and domestically oriented economic activity the party leadership appears to have chosen a new strategy one that seeks to maintain the existing growth process by expanding it beyond china s national borders its one belt and one road initiative the one belt one road initiative xi jinping was elected president by the national people s congress in 2013 and soon after his election he announced his support for perhaps the world s largest economic project the one belt one road initiative bri however it was not until 2015 after consultations between various commissions and ministries that an action plan was published and the state aggressively moved forward with the initiative the initial aim of the bri was to link china with 70 other countries across asia africa europe and oceania there are two parts to the initial bri vision the belt which seeks to recreate the old silk road land trade route and the road which is not actually a road but a series of ports creating a sea based trade route spanning several oceans the initiative was to be given form through a number of separate but linked investments in large scale gas and oil pipelines roads railroads and ports as well as connecting economic corridors although there is no official bri map the following provides an illustration of its proposed territorial reach one reason that there is yet no official bri map is that the initiative has continued to evolve in addition to infrastructure it now includes efforts at financial integration cooperation in science and technology cultural and academic exchanges and the establishment of trade cooperation mechanisms moreover its geographic focus has also expanded for example in september 2018 venezuela announced that the country will now join china s ambitious new silk road commercial plan which is allegedly worth u s 900 billion venezuela follows uruguay which was the first south american country to receive bri funds xi s initiative did not come out of the blue as noted above chinese economic growth had become ever more reliant on foreign investment and exports and in support of the process the chinese government had used its own foreign investment and loans to secure markets and the raw materials needed to support its export activity in fact chinese official aid to developing countries in 2010 and 2011 surpassed the value of all world bank world bank wb the world bank was founded as part of the new international monetary system set up at bretton woods in 1944 its capital is provided by member states contributions and loans on the international money markets it financed public and private projects in third world and east european countries it consists of several closely associated institutions among which 1 the international bank for reconstruction and development ibrd 189 members in 2017 which provides loans in productive sectors such as farming or energy 2 the international development association ida 159 members in 1997 which provides less advanced countries with long term loans 35 40 years at very low interest 1 3 the international finance corporation ifc which provides both loan and equity finance for business ventures in developing countries as third world debt gets worse the world bank along with the imf tends to adopt a macro economic perspective for instance it enforces adjustment policies that are intended to balance heavily indebted countries payments the world bank advises those countries that have to undergo the imf s therapy on such matters as how to reduce budget deficits round up savings enduce foreign investors to settle within their borders or free prices and exchange rates loans to these countries china s leading role in the creation of the brics brics the term brics an acronym for brazil russia india china and south africa was first used in 2001 by jim o neill then an economist at goldman sachs the strong economic growth of these countries combined with their important geopolitical position these 5 countries bring together almost half the world s population on 4 continents and almost a quarter of the world s gdp make the brics major players in international economic and financial activities new development bank asia infrastructural investment bank and the proposed shanghai cooperation organization bank demonstrates the importance chinese leaders place on having a more active role in shaping regional and international economic activity but the bri if one is to take chinese state pronouncements at their word appears to have the highest priority of all these efforts and in fact serves as the umbrella project for all of china s growing external initiatives in brief the bri appears to represent nothing less than an attempt to solve china s problems of overcapacity and surplus capital declining trade opportunities growing debt and falling rates of profit profit the positive gain yielded from a company s activity net profit is profit after tax distributable profit is the part of the net profit which can be distributed to the shareholders through a geographic expansion of china s economic activity and processes sadly this effort to sustain the basic core of the existing chinese growth model is far from worker friendly the same year that the bri action plan was published the chinese government began a massive crackdown on labor activism for example in 2015 the government launched an unprecedented crackdown on several worker centers operating in the southern part of the country placing a number of its worker activists in detention centers this move coincided with renewed repression of the work of worker friendly journalists and activist lawyers the financial times noted that these actions may well represent the harshest crackdown against organized labor by the chinese authorities in two decades and attacks against workers and those who support them continue a case in point in august of this year police in riot gear broke into a house in huizhou occupied by recent graduates from some of china s top universities who had come to the city to support worker organizing efforts some 50 people were detained 14 remain in custody or under house arrest a flawed strategy to achieve its aims the bri has largely involved the promotion of projects that mandate the use of chinese enterprises and workers are financed by loans that host countries must repay and either by necessity or design lead to direct chinese ownership of strategic infrastructure for example the center for strategic studies recently calculated that approximately 90 of belt and road projects are being built by chinese companies while bri investments might temporarily help sustain key chinese industries suffering from overcapacity absorb surplus capital and boost enterprise profit margins they are unlikely to serve as a permanent fix for china s growing economic challenges they will only push off the day of reckoning one reason for this negative view is that in the rush to generate projects many are not financially viable andreea brinza writing in foreign policy illustrates this problem with an examination of european railway projects if one image has come to define the belt and road initiative bri china s ambitious amorphous project of overseas investment it s the railway every few months or so the media praises a new line that will supposedly connect a chinese city with a european capital today it s budapest yesterday it was london they are the newest additions to china s iron network of transcontinental railway routes spanning eurasia but the vast majority of these routes are economically pointless unlikely to operate at a profit and driven far more by political need than market demand chongqing duisburg yiwu london yiwu madrid zhengzhou hamburg suzhou warsaw and xi an budapest are among the more than 40 routes that now connect china with europe yet out of all these only chongqing duisburg connecting china with germany was created out of a genuine market need the other routes are political creations by beijing to nourish its relations with european states like poland hungary and britain the chongqing duisburg route has been described as a benchmark for the belt the part of the project that crosses eurasia by land the road is a series of nominally linked ports with little coherence but paradoxically enough the chongqing duisburg route was created before chinese president xi jinping announced what has become his flagship project then one belt one road and now the bri it was an existing route reused and redeveloped by hewlett packard and launched in 2011 to halve the time it took for the computing firm s laptops to reach europe from china by sea unlike the hp route in which trains arrived in europe full of laptops and other gadgets the containers on the new routes come to europe full of low tech chinese products but they leave empty as there s little worth transporting by rail that chinese consumers want with only half the route effectively being used the whole trip often loses money for chinese companies that export toys home products or decorations the maritime route is far more profitable because it comes at half the price tag even though it s slower the europe china railroads are unproductive not only because of the transportation price as each container needs to be insulated to withstand huge temperature differences but also because russia has imposed a ban on both the import and the transport of european food through its territory food is one of the product categories that can actually turn a profit on a europe china land run without it filling china bound containers isn t an easy job for example it took more than three months to refill and resend to china a train that came to london from yiwu although the route was heavily promoted by both a british government desperate for post brexit trade and a chinese one determined to talk up the bri today most of the bri s rail routes function only thanks to chinese government subsidies the average subsidy per trip for a 20 foot container is between 3 500 and 4 000 depending on the local government for example chinese cities like wuhan and zhengzhou offer almost 30 million in subsidies every year to cargo companies thanks to this financial assistance chinese and western companies can pay a more affordable price per container without subsidies it would cost around 9 000 to send a 20 foot container by railway compared with 5 000 after subsidies although the chinese government is losing money on each trip it plans to increase the yearly number of trips from around 1 900 in 2016 to 5 000 cargo trains in 2020 another reason to doubt the viability of the bri is that a growing number of countries are becoming reluctant to participate because it means that they will have to borrow funds for projects that may or may not benefit the country and or generate the foreign exchange necessary to repay the loans as a result the actual value of projects is far less than reported in the media thomas s eder and jacob mardell make this point in their discussion of bri activities with 16 central and eastern european countries the 16 1 because of these investment requirements many countries are either canceling or scaling back their bri projects the south china morning post recently reported that the malaysian government decided to cancel two china financed mega projects in the country the us 20 billion east coast rail link and two gas pipeline projects worth us 2 3 billion malaysian prime minister said his country could not afford those projects and they were not needed at the moment indeed mahathir s decision is just the latest setback for the plan as politicians and economists in an increasing number of countries that once courted chinese investments have now publicly expressed fears that some of the projects are too costly and would saddle them with too much debt myanmar is as reuters reports one of those countries myanmar has scaled back plans for a chinese backed port on its western coast sharply reducing the cost of the project after concerns it could leave the southeast asian nation heavily indebted a top government official and an advisor told reuters the initial 7 3 billion price tag on the kyauk pyu deepwater port on the western tip of myanmar s conflict torn rakhine state set off alarm bells due to reports of troubled chinese backed projects in sri lanka and pakistan the official and the advisor said deputy finance minister set aung who was appointed to lead project negotiations in may told reuters the project size has been tremendously scaled down the revised cost would be around 1 3 billion something that s much more plausible for myanmar s use said sean turnell economic advisor to myanmar s civilian leader aung san suu kyi a third reason for doubting the viability of the bri to solve chinese economic problems is the building political blowback from china s growing ownership position of key infrastructure that is either the result of or built into the terms of its bri investment activity an example of the former outcome the sri lankan government was forced to hand over the strategic port of hambantota to china on a 99 year lease after it could not repay its more than 8 billion in loans from chinese firms unfortunately africa offers many examples of both outcomes as described in a policy brief survey of china africa bri activities in bri projects chinese soes overseas are moving away from turnkey engineering procurement and construction epc projects towards longer term chinese participation as managers and stakeholders in running projects china merchants holding which constructed the new multipurpose port and industrial zone complex in djibouti is also a stakeholder and will be jointly managing the zone in a consortium with djiboutian port authorities for ten years likewise soe contractors for new standard gauge railway projects in ethiopia and kenya will also be tasked with railway maintenance and operations for five to ten years after construction is completed beyond transportation the bri is spurring expansion of digital infrastructure through an information silk road this is an extension of the going out of china s telecommunications companies including private mobile giants huawei and zte who have constructed a number of telecommunications infrastructure projects in africa but also the expansion of large soes such as china telecoms china telecoms has established a new data center in djibouti that will connect it to the company s other regional hubs in asia europe and to china and potentially facilitate the development of submarine fibre cable networks in east africa countries linked to the bri including morocco egypt and ethiopia have also been singled out industrial cooperation demonstration and pioneering countries and priority partners for production capacity cooperation countries these countries have seen a rapid expansion of chinese built industrial zones presaging not only greater trade but also industrial investment from china however the rapid expansion in infrastructure credit that the bri offers also brings significant risks many of these large infrastructure projects are supported through debt based finance raising questions over african economies rising debt levels and its sustainability for resource rich economies low commodity values have strained government revenues and precipitated exchange rate crises both of which constrain a government s ability to repay external borrowing in tanzania the bri associated bagamoyo deepwater port was suspended by the government in 2016 due to lack of funds the port was originally a joint investment between tanzanian and chinese partners china merchants holding which would construct the port and road infrastructure along with a special economic zone while project construction has continued funding constraints have meant that the government has had to forego its equity equity the capital put into an enterprise by the shareholders not to be confused with hard capital or unsecured debt stake this represents a case where african governments may risk losing ownership of projects as well as the long term revenues they bring adding to political tensions is the fact that many bri projects displace or disrupt existing communities or sensitive ecological areas it is no wonder that china has seen a rapid growth in the number of private security companies that serve chinese companies participating in bri projects in the words of the asia times these firms are described as china s private army fueled by growing demand from domestic companies involved in the multi trillion dollar belt and road initiative independent security groups are expanding in the country in 2013 there were 4 000 registered firms employing more than 4 3 million personnel by 2017 the figure had jumped to 5 000 with staff numbers hovering around the five million mark what lies ahead the reasons highlighted above make it highly unlikely that the bri will significantly improve chinese long term economic prospects thus it seems likely that chinese growth will continue to decline leading to new internal tensions as the government s response to the bri s limitations will likely include new efforts to constrain labor activism and repress wages hopefully the strength of chinese resistance to this repression will create the space for meaningful public discussion of new options that truly are responsive to majority needs originally published reports from the economic front october 2 2018

after the synchronized global economic expansion of 2017 came the asynchronous growth of 2018 when most countries other than the united states started to experience slowdowns worries about us inflation the us federal reserve s policy trajectory ongoing trade wars italian budget and debt woes china s slowdown and emerging market fragilities led to a sharp fall in global equity markets toward the end of the year the good news at the start of 2019 is that the risk of an outright global recession is low the bad news is that we are heading into a year of synchronized global deceleration growth will fall toward and in some cases below potential in most regions to be sure the year started with a rally in risky assets us and global equities after the bloodbath of the last quarter of 2018 when worries about fed interest rate hikes and about chinese and us growth tanked many markets since then the fed has pivoted toward renewed dovishness the us has maintained solid growth and china s macroeconomic easing has shown some promise of containing the slowdown there whether these relatively positive conditions last will depend on many factors the first thing to consider is the fed markets are now pricing in the fed s monetary policy pause for the entire year but the us labour market remains robust were wages to accelerate and produce even moderate inflation above 2 per cent fears of at least two more rate hikes this year would return possibly shocking markets and leading to a tightening of financial conditions that in turn will revive concerns about us growth second as the slowdown in china continues the government s current mix of modest monetary credit and fiscal stimulus could prove inadequate given the lack of private sector confidence and high levels of overcapacity and leverage if worries about a chinese slowdown resurface markets could be severely affected on the other hand a stabilization of growth would duly renew market confidence a related factor is trade while an escalation of the sino american conflict would hamper global growth a continuation of the current truce via a deal on trade would reassure markets even as the two countries geopolitical and technology rivalry continues to build over time fourth the eurozone is slowing down and it remains to be seen whether it is heading toward lower potential growth or something worse the outcome will be determined both by national level variables such as political developments in france italy and germany and broader regional and global factors obviously a hard brexit would negatively affect business and investor confidence in the united kingdom and the european union alike us president donald trump extending his trade war to the european automotive sector would severely undercut growth across the eu not just in germany finally much will depend on how euroskeptic parties fare in the european parliament elections this may and that in turn will add to the uncertainties surrounding european central bank president mario draghi s successor and the future of eurozone monetary policy fifth america s dysfunctional domestic politics could add to uncertainties globally the recent government shutdown suggests that every upcoming negotiation over the budget and the debt ceiling will turn into a partisan war of attrition an expected report from the special counsel robert mueller may or may not lead to impeachment proceedings against trump and by the end of the year the fiscal stimulus from the republican tax cuts will become a fiscal drag possibly weakening growth sixth equity markets in the us and elsewhere are still overvalued even after the recent correction as wage costs rise weaker us earnings and profit margins in the coming months could be an unwelcome surprise with highly indebted firms facing the possibility of rising short and long term borrowing costs and with many tech stocks in need of further corrections the danger of another risk off episode and market correction can t be ruled out seventh oil prices may be driven down by a coming supply glut owing to shale production in the us a potential regime change in venezuela leading to expectations of greater production over time and failures by opec countries to cooperate with one another to constrain output while low oil prices are good for consumers they tend to weaken us stocks and markets in oil exporting economies raising concerns about corporate defaults in the energy and related sectors as happened in early 2016 finally the outlook for many emerging market economies will depend on the aforementioned global uncertainties the chief risks include slowdowns in the us or china higher us inflation and a subsequent tightening by the fed trade wars a stronger dollar and falling oil and commodity prices though there is a cloud over the global economy the silver lining is that it has made the major central banks more dovish starting with the fed and the people s bank of china and quickly followed by the european central bank the bank of england the bank of japan and others still the fact that most central banks are in a highly accommodative position means that there is little room for additional monetary easing and even if fiscal policy wasn t constrained in most regions of the world stimulus tends to come only after a growth stall is already underway and usually with a significant lag there may be enough positive factors to make this a relatively decent if mediocre year for the global economy but if some of the negative scenarios outlined above materialize the synchronized slowdown of 2019 could lead to a global growth stall and sharp market downturn in 2020 project syndicate

a year ago on the eve of president ramaphosa s first state of the nation address sona the rand was trading at r11 56 per us dollar last week the exchange rate was r13 60 per dollar before the big speech this is not far from where it was two years ago when jacob zuma delivered what was to be his final sona this should make a point many often miss markets don t care nearly as much about who the president is or what they say as you might think global factors not local the bigger drivers of the rand are global not local commodity prices and investor sentiment towards emerging markets usually when people refer to the rand they refer to the rand us dollar exchange rate it is one of the top 20 most actively traded currency pairs in the world according to the bank for international settlements which puts it ahead of other countries with larger economies due to its liquidity it s often used as a proxy for other less freely tradable emerging market currencies by investors therefore our local currency is usually at the top or the bottom of the ranking tables of best or worst performing currencies last year it was close to the bottom and a few weeks into 2019 it s close to the top supporting the rand and other emerging market currencies this year has been the pivot in the interest rate policy of the us federal reserve fed expectations of rising us interest rates attracted capital from the rest of the world strengthening the dollar and weakening other currencies with the fed now seemingly on pause the dollar s upward momentum has stalled too sentiment to emerging markets can be gauged by credit default swap cds spreads these are essentially insurance contracts against the risk of a bond not getting repaid and as with all insurance premiums rise with perceived risk south africa s cds spreads widened during 2018 in line with our peer group but have narrowed again this year currently the market is pricing brazil as a lower risk than south africa despite the fact that our credit rating is one notch higher the market seems to be pricing in an upgrade for brazil or downgrade for south africa the enthusiasm for brazil is based on the reform promises of new president jair bolsonaro especially the reform of the burdensome public pension system the market rates bolsonaro s chances of successful reform as higher than ramaphosa s which doesn t seem right as ramaphosa s party controls the legislature while bolsonaro doesn t breaking up is hard to do nonetheless this was one of the more consequential sonas in recent years with a strong focus on reviving the domestic economy making it easier to do business and tackling corruption of particular interest from a market point of view was the announcement that eskom would be unbundled into separate distribution transmission and generation entities this is not a new proposal it was first mooted by government 20 years ago together with cost reductions it marks a first step on the long road to financial sustainability a failure to implement these reforms characterised by ramaphosa as painful risks crippling not only eskom but also the economy as a whole the big question of how much financial support eskom will get from the state to manage its debt burden will be revealed at next week s budget speech this more than any other item will dominate finance minister tito mboweni s address the challenge is always to turn talk into action and past sonas have fallen flat on this score what is notably different this time is the extent to which government and business are talking to one another last week ramaphosa also became the first sitting president to address the annual mining indaba which along with other recent summits at least demonstrates an intent to work with the private sector commodity prices the rand has also benefited from firmer commodity prices this year this might seem surprising given that commodity prices in general are vulnerable to any slowdown in global growth however each commodity has its own supply and demand dynamics the four main commodities produced in south africa according to stats sa numbers are coal 24 of the total platinum group metals 23 gold 16 and iron ore 12 gold has found some support with the shift in the us interest rate stance and is above 1 300 oz for the first time in a year within the platinum group metals pgm basket platinum and palladium had divergent fortunes as the former is largely linked to production of diesel vehicles which have fallen out of favour with consumers the palladium price overtook platinum in late 2017 and has surged ahead this year stats sa does not split platinum and palladium production but based on company reports the total pgm basked is about two thirds platinum and one third palladium this total basket price has gained in recent months the iron ore price plunged from a level of above 140 per ton in 2013 to a low of 40 in early 2016 this brutal collapse weighed not only on mining activity and jobs but also on the share prices of anglo american through its holding in kumba and bhp the jse s mining heavyweights the iron ore price has jumped from 65 to 95 since december following the tragic collapse of a tailings dam at a brazilian iron ore mine production has been halted there and at similar mines operated by vale the world s largest producer elsewhere in the country so far the oil market has not reacted much to the imposition of sanctions on venezuela by the us venezuela has the biggest reserves of any country but production has halved in recent years due to the mismanagement and politicisation of the state owned oil company the announced major oil and gas discovery off the southern cape coast is estimated at one billion barrels while venezuela s proven reserves are 300 billion barrels it is too soon to gauge how south africa s brulpadda discovery will impact the economy and the rand because it is still fairly early in the exploration stage but it sounds promising for a country that imports most of its petroleum needs customs data shows imports of mineral products mostly oil at r233 billion last year it is unlikely to lead to lower fuel prices since even locally produced petroleum would be sold at prevailing global prices as is the case with sasol s output pound pounded and euro to zero there are a number of currency pairs that include the rand apart from the rand dollar the most important are the rand euro and rand sterling exchange rates since an exchange rate is basically a ratio of two prices it has two moving parts developments affecting either economy can influence it for instance sterling has been impacted by the evolving brexit drama the less likely the uk is to crash out of the european union without a transitional agreement in place a so called hard brexit the better the pound has done this in turn has largely been a function of conservative party internal politics and hence unstable unlike most other currencies the euro is shared by a number of countries and always vulnerable to unravelling if a member state should leave while the uk is leaving the european union it thankfully was never part of the single currency so there is no need to redenominate contracts debts and bank accounts into a new currency it would be a different matter if say italy left italy is back in technical recession after two consecutive negative quarters and its real income per head is lower than a decade ago moreover it has a populist coalition government in place but with more debt denominated in euros than any other country in europe its exit would cause chaos especially as italian banks are the biggest holders of that debt rands and sense finally how should investors think about the rand s moves firstly the rand has historically been a large inflation driver but not by as much as generally thought a stronger rand will typically lower inflation and take pressure off interest rates it therefore supports bonds and other assets sensitive to interest rates secondly the jse is dominated by global companies that should in theory benefit from a weaker rand but it doesn t automatically happen in practice last year the rand weakened 16 but non resource rand hedges performed poorly for company or sector specific issues this year the jse is positive despite a stronger rand finally the direct offshore component of any portfolio should benefit from a weaker rand all else being equal but clearly the currency can introduce short term volatility there are a lot of moving parts pushing and pulling the currency and whether it strengthens or weakens from here will largely depend on global factors and much less on the noisy lead up to the general election on may 8 and its aftermath dave mohr is chief investment strategist and izak odendaal an investment strategist at old mutual multi managers

increase in adjusted net income per common share was due to the november 2017 acquisition of tembec inc tembec fourth quarter 2018 net income was 13 million or 0 18 per diluted common share compared to 295 million or 5 01 per diluted common share in the fourth quarter of 2017 fourth quarter 2018 adjusted net income was 13 million or 0 19 per diluted common share compared to 29 million or 0 50 per diluted common share in the fourth quarter of 2017 the unadjusted earnings for both the full year and fourth quarter 2017 and 2018 include a gain on bargain purchase in 2017 and the related adjustments in 2018 a reconciliation of net income to adjusted net income and the related impact on diluted earnings per share can be found on schedule f we achieved two significant objectives in 2018 the successful completion of our 140 million 2015 cost transformation initiative and the integration of tembec operations the principles and culture established during our cost transformation initiative helped us navigate difficult market conditions over the past few years and those same competencies are the foundation of the incremental value we expect to be created from the combined companies said paul boynton chairman president and chief executive officer in 2018 we delivered solid financial results despite volatility in the global economy our efforts to create a culture of continuous cost improvement along with the successful integration of tembec has positioned the company to capture enhanced value for our stockholders in 2019 and beyond full year and fourth quarter

net sales or operating results that would have resulted had the acquisition occurred for the period nor project the results of operations for any future date or period high purity cellulose operating income for the three month period ended december 31 2018 increased 5 million driven by the operating income from the tembec acquisition for the full period operating income decreased 8 million for the twelve month period ended december 31 2018 over the comparable 2017 period as previously announced lower contracted price and volumes for cellulose specialties as well as higher chemical and wood costs from the company s legacy operations were only partially offset by the operating income from the tembec acquisition on a combined basis operating income for the three and twelve month periods ended december 31 2018 decreased over the comparable 2017 periods by 8 million and 68 million respectively these declines were primarily driven by the expected full year 4 percent decrease in cellulose specialties sales prices and 3 percent decline in volumes combined with higher wood chemical and energy costs as well as increased depreciation from the write up of fixed assets associated with the tembec acquisition the twelve month period was also negatively impacted by an unplanned production outage in the first quarter of 2018 the benefits of the four strategic pillars of growth partially offset above referenced cost increases additionally the 2018 three and twelve month periods were negatively impacted by 1 million and 4 million respectively of the company s share of its new lignin joint venture losses forest products operating income for the three month period ended december 31 2018 decreased over the comparable 2017 period by 10 million the operating loss of 10 million for the three month period ended december 31 2018 was driven primarily by lower sales prices and reduced volumes due to softness in the u s housing market operating income for the twelve month periods ended december 31 2018 increased over the comparable 2017 period by 25 million driven by the operating income from the tembec acquisition in addition both periods were impacted by higher duties and higher processing costs driven by market related downtime and the write down of inventories to current net realizable value as a result of lower sales prices in december these more than offset the impact of the inventory write up to fair value from the tembec acquisition on a combined basis operating income decreased 23 million for the three month period ended december 31 2018 over the comparable 2017 period as higher lumber sales volumes were more than offset by lower lumber sales prices higher wood and transportation costs operating income decreased 15 million for the twelve month period ended december 31 2018 over the comparable 2017 period as higher lumber sales prices were partially offset by lower sales volumes as well as higher costs for wood and transportation in addition both periods were impacted by higher duties and higher processing costs driven by market related downtime and the write down of inventories to current net realizable value as a result of lower sales prices in december on a combined basis for the twelve month periods ended december 31 2018 and 2017 the forest products group incurred approximately 26 million and 11 million respectively in softwood lumber duties pulp operating income for the three and twelve month periods ended december 31 2018 increased over the comparable 2017 periods by 16 million and 91 million respectively driven by the operating income of the tembec acquisition on a combined basis operating income for the three and twelve month periods ended december 31 2018 increased 1 million and 45 million respectively due to higher high yield pulp prices of 7 percent and 21 percent respectively partially offset by lower sales volumes sales volumes in the three month period ended december 31 2018 were unfavorably impacted by order cancellations in december as markets weakened substantially specifically in china paper operating income for the three and twelve month periods ended december 31 2018 increased over the comparable 2017 periods by 9 million and 32 million respectively driven by the tembec acquisition on a combined basis operating income decreased 3 million and 12 million for the three and twelve month periods ended december 31 2018 over the comparable 2017 period as higher newsprint prices were more than offset by higher pulp costs in paperboard and increased amortization and depreciation related to the purchase accounting associated with the acquisition of tembec corporate operating expense for the three month period ended december 31 2018 decreased over the comparable 2017 period by 8 million due to the one time tembec transaction costs incurred in december of 2017 operating expense for the twelve month period ended december 31 2018 increased over the comparable 2017 period by 3 million driven by the on going corporate costs of tembec on a combined basis operating expense increased 11 million and 4 million for the three and twelve month periods ended december 31 2018 over the comparable 2017 periods driven by higher costs for disposed operations higher incentive compensation costs and 4 million of severance expense in the third quarter 2015 cost transformation initiative in 2015 with nearly 1 billion in debt as a result of the spin off from its former parent and facing significant market and inflation headwinds the company embarked on an ambitious four year program to rapidly transform its business with the goal of reducing costs by 140 million to mitigate these headwinds and enhance its financial flexibility in 2018 the company completed the program and reached its goal as a result of this initiative the company was able to improve its balance sheet and access equity markets enabling the acquisition of tembec and build significant competencies in continuous improvement and cost transformation that it expects will provide additional opportunities to grow ebitda in the coming years strategic pillars of growth with the acquisition of tembec in late 2017 the company announced its four strategic pillars of growth with the goal of generating 155 million of incremental ebitda by year end 2020 excluding the impact of inflation changes in commodity prices and one time costs to achieve the goal including 25 million associated with the 2015 cost transformation initiative the company captured 61 million of ebitda in 2018 from this initiative primarily from reduced corporate expense enhanced procurement practices reductions in operational costs and returns on strategic investments non operating expenses interest expense was 15 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 and 60 million for the full year the increases of 2 million and 20 million over the prior year three and twelve month periods respectively were due to higher debt balances and interest rates associated with the financing for the acquisition of tembec interest income and other expenses net increased in the current year primarily due to the favorable impact of tembec s pension plans on other components of net periodic pension costs as well as the foreign exchange gain on the re measurement of certain debt instruments non operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2018 also includes 20 million in adjustments to the gain on bargain purchase associated with the acquisition of tembec income tax expense the 2018 effective tax rate was 25 percent for 2018 compared to 6 percent in the prior year period the 2018 effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 21 percent primarily due to different statutory tax rates of foreign operations and u s taxes from the inclusion of certain foreign income partially offset by an adjustment to the nontaxable bargain purchase included in pretax income a return to accrual adjustment related to previously filed tax returns and the release of an uncertain tax position reserve the prior year effective tax rate differed from the then enacted federal statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to a nontaxable bargain purchase gain included in pretax income cash flows and liquidity during 2018 the company generated operating cash flows of 247 million and adjusted free cash flows of 152 million working capital used 28 million of cash as higher accounts receivable and finished goods inventories were partially offset by the increases in accounts payable due to the timing of payments and accrued liabilities associated with derivative contracts from company s foreign currency hedging program during 2018 the company invested 132 million in capital expenditures which included approximately 37 million of strategic capital additionally the company received approximately 16 million from the sale of its resins operations the company made principal payments or repurchased 45 million of debt during 2018 and ended the year with adjusted net debt of 1 084 million and 326 million of total liquidity including 109 million of cash and 217 million available under the revolving credit facility after taking into account outstanding letters of credit the company also returned 72 million of capital to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases year to date the company maintains a disciplined capital allocation strategy focused on maintaining its manufacturing assets followed by reducing debt levels to a targeted 2 5 times net debt to ebitda leverage ratio adjusted free cash flow is then deployed opportunistically between strategic capital investment external investments and returning capital to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks outlook high purity cellulose in 2019 the company expects stability in its cellulose specialties markets cellulose specialty sales prices are anticipated to decline approximately 1 percent from 2018 primarily due to a contract acquired from tembec and excludes any impact of chinese duties cellulose specialty sales volumes are expected to decline approximately 1 percent primarily due to weakness in the acetate market commodity product sales prices are expected to increase in 2019 commodity product sales volumes are expected to increase by over 75 000 metric tons as a result of improved operational reliability and initiatives to reduce inventory levels inflation is expected to be approximately 3 percent driven primarily by higher wood and transportation costs offset by the expected impact of the strategic pillars of growth in 2019 excluding the impact of the sale of the resin operations adjusted ebitda for the segment is expected to be flat in 2019 with the second half accounting for approximately 55 percent of ebitda forest products lumber futures prices have improved from their lows in december and our lumber prices are expected to improve as the year progresses longer term the u s housing market remains a key driver of lumber sales prices and the company is well positioned to benefit from these long term trends in addition softwood lumber duties of approximately 20 percent on sales to the u s are expected to continue throughout 2019 benefits from capital investments and cost reductions are also expected to provide incremental profitability in 2019 the company will aggressively manage the asset utilization of and investment in the segment including potentially taking downtime as deemed necessary if market conditions warrant pulp high yield pulp prices are expected to be lower in the first quarter of 2019 compared to fourth quarter of 2018 due to weaker demand specifically from china over the medium term solid global demand for pulp reduced recycled fiber imports to china and global industry production at or near capacity continue to support pulp prices above historical averages with no significant new capacity expected in the pulp markets through 2020 supply demand dynamics should continue to yield positive market conditions and strong segment results in 2019 paper in 2019 paperboard prices are expected to remain stable while newsprint sales prices are expected to decline as a result of the reversal of duties in 2018 capital allocation and investment the company anticipates that it will spend approximately 95 million to 105 million in maintenance capital expenditures across all segments in 2019 in addition the company anticipates spending approximately 28 million on high return strategic projects in 2019 the company also expects to increase the percentage of its cash flow directed toward debt repayment due to weaker commodity forest products and paper markets the company anticipates the continued return of capital to shareholders through its common stock dividend and the opportunistic repurchase of common shares we see a substantial opportunity to drive higher value in our business through the execution of our strategic plan by focusing on achieving our cost savings goals developing new products optimizing existing markets and delivering a balanced capital allocation strategy that is prudent and maximizes the returns for our stockholders concluded boynton we have made significant progress in stabilizing our high purity cellulose business our goal is to enhance cellulose specialties margins by launching a new go to market strategy focused on commercial and asset optimization to more than offset inflation so that the benefits from the strategic pillars fall to the bottom line we plan to detail this strategic path

new york cnn business it s a big fat scary round number the national debt reached 22 trillion on monday that s bigger than the entire economic output of the united states in a year is it time to panic no but it may be time to worry a bit about the direction the debt is heading what is debt the first thing to know is that 22 trillion is a misleading number because it includes two types of debt the money the federal government owes to itself and the money the federal government owes to everybody else the former known as intragovernmental debt is mostly what the treasury owes to trust funds like social security that s important but not as important as debt held by the public which is what can impact the economy by fueling inflation or crowding out private investment right now debt held by the public stands at 16 2 trillion even if you measure it as a share of the economy that s a lot of money it s about 76 of gross domestic product which is very high by historical standards it ballooned in the wake of the great recession when the federal government spent liberally to save the economy from total collapse and hasn t been paid down much since another important note the debt is different from the deficit or the difference between what the federal government spends and what it collects in revenue each year the debt represents the accumulation of deficits over time deficits have been rising over the past several years and jumped to 3 9 of gdp in 2019 the highest share since 2013 when the country was still emerging from a deep recession in part because of tax cuts that sharply reduced government income is debt bad not necessarily it depends on what you re using it for the problem with debt is that servicing it costs money the us paid 325 billion in net interest in 2018 according to the congressional budget office which forecasts that number to jump to 383 billion in 2019 and 928 billion in 2029 under current law as a percentage of gross domestic product that will approach levels not seen since the 1980s when interest rates the cost per unit of debt were spiraling out of control interest rates are rising slowly now as the federal reserve tapers off a period of near zero rates but they remain low it s also unusual at a time when the economy is in very good shape raising the question of what happens when the government has to spend its way out of the next recession if we go through a business cycle and we re starting at this level then the business cycle would lead to very large deficits said cbo director keith hall at a briefing with reporters last month i think that s a concern as a risk going forward however it still could be worth it to rack up debt and pay a lot in interest if what the government is spending money on generates a larger economic return than the cost of credit a shift in the economic winds in recent months economists have been taking another look at their longstanding consensus that high debt levels are unequivocally bad for economic growth a view that led to austerity budgets in both the united states and europe following the great recession which may have slowed the recovery voices on the left have been arguing that governments can spend as much as they want in their own currency and control inflation through taxation that philosophy is known as modern monetary theory and it has been used to explain how large spending programs such as student debt relief or the green new deal might be funded most economists don t go that far but they have been cautioning over high debt levels that get out of hand a few weeks ago former obama administration economic policy officials larry summers and jason furman made the case in foreign policy that high deficits should not be used as an excuse to cut social programs like medicare and social security and that the federal government should instead find ways to recover revenues lost to generations of tax cuts and at the american economics association s conference in january former international monetary fund chief economist olivier blanchard delivered a keynote speech theorizing that debt might not be a problem as long as interest rates are reasonably low as they have been for decades now and government is using the money on projects that boost productivity such as education and infrastructure both the fiscal and welfare costs of debt may then be small smaller than is generally taken as given in current policy discussions blanchard wrote in a paper describing the argument

ebitda growing to 212 million reflecting strong process productivity improvements and the impact of our continuous focus on cost reduction initiatives q4 was another quarter of strong improving performance for aec with significant growth in sales operating income and adjusted ebitda compared to q4 2017 net sales excluding the impact of asc 606 and currency translation effects increased 34 while profitability continued to improve compared to q4 2017 the increase in sales in q4 was substantially driven by the leap program sales of fan cases fan blades and spacers for leap engines which represented about 44 of aec q4 2018 sales grew 31 compared to q4 2017 reflecting aec s continued execution related to the unprecedented steep ramp up of this jet engine program higher sales of boeing 787 fuselage frames as well as f 35 and ch 53k components also contributed to the growth in sales combined sales for these three programs grew 43 compared to q4 2017 aec operating income continued to improve as it grew to 6 7 million in q4 compared to 0 6 million in q4 2017 adjusted ebitda also continued to improve in the quarter as it increased to 18 1 million or 17 9 of net sales compared to 10 8 million or 14 1 of net sales in q4 2017 the increase in both operating income and adjusted ebitda reflects not only higher sales volume but also productivity improvements resulting from the deployment of a disciplined standardized operational system across our aec plants as well as the favorable impact of our continuous improvement program the aec team is improving quality and on time delivery to our customers despite increasing demand and record shipment levels for the full year 2018 aec net sales excluding the impact of asc 606 and currency translation effects increased 36 compared to 2017 exceeding the upper end of the 20 to 30 range we discussed in past quarters sales related to the leap program were the largest driver of this increase along with growth in sales of boeing 787 fuselage frames and f 35 and ch 53k components aec s profitability also saw strong improvement in 2018 with sharp increases in operating income and adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda in 2018 grew to 63 million or 17 1 of net sales in r d our new product development activities which focus on existing derivative and new technologies and our process improvement projects which aim to optimize our operational performance across aec continued in q4 to build upon the progress of prior quarters our continued execution on our major existing contracts as well as on anticipated new contract wins provides the potential for aec to reach annual sales of 500 million to 550 million in 2020 as i have stated in previous quarters the potential for aec beyond 2020 will be based not only on executing on the continued ramp up of existing programs on which we are already well established but also on increasing share or acquiring first time content on ramping programs while at the same time winning new contracts on future commercial and defense airframe and engine platforms now let s go back to john for more details on the quarter john john cozzolino chief financial officer and treasurer thank you olivier i d like to refer you to our q4 financial performance slides starting with slide 3 net sales by segment total company net sales in q4 increased 11 compared to q4 2017 and 14 5 excluding both currency and asc 606 effects in q4 excluding currency and asc 606 mc net sales were up 4 5 and aec net sales increased 34 3 compared to q4 last year for the full year 2018 excluding currency and asc 606 effects total company net sales increased 13 6 compared to 2017 with mc sales up 3 3 and aec sales up 35 9 as discussed in the press release in q4 the company discovered implementation issues related to the adoption of asc 606 the issues were related to the mc segment only and caused an immaterial overstatement in revenue and income previously reported in the first nine months of 2018 the issues have been corrected and previously reported amounts for 2018 will be revised in our 2019 quarterly filings we have also incorporated the revised amounts into each of these slides in addition slide 9 provides the revised numbers for q1 through q3 2018 for certain financial statement line items and adjusted ebitda turning to slide 4 total company gross profit margin is 34 9 in q4 compared to 34 2 in q4 2017 aec gross profit margin in q4 was 14 5 compared to 13 1 in q4 last year mc gross profit margin in q4 stayed strong at 48 6 compared to 45 in q4 last year for the full year mc gross profit margin improved to 48 6 in 2018 compared to 47 5 in 2017 and aec improved to 14 2 slides 5 and 6 show net income and adjusted ebitda by segment for the quarter and the full year adjusted ebitda for the total company in q4 2018 was 57 7 million compared to 43 4 million in q4 2017 for the full year of 2018 adjusted ebitda for the total company increased to 228 9 million compared to 169 4 million last year mc finished the year strong with adjusted ebitda of 51 2 million bringing the full year total to 212 1 million both results were significant improvements over last year aec adjusted ebitda in q4 was 18 1 million and 63 3 million for the year aec adjusted ebitda as a percentage of net sales in 2018 improved to 17 1 moving on to slide 7 earnings per share net income attributable to the company in q4 was 0 55 per share compared to 0 18 per share in q4 of last year excluding adjustments for restructuring tax items currency revaluation and the net impact of a pension settlement charge and a curtailment gain net income attributable to the company was 0 74 per share in q4 compared to 0 44 per share last year on a full year basis net income attributable to the company excluding adjustments was 2 82 per share in 2018 compared to 1 67 per share last year slide 8 shows our total debt and net debt cash flows were very good in q4 which included the impact of improved working capital during the quarter as a result total debt decreased just over 5 million to a balance of 525 million at the end of the year while cash balances increased about 37 million to a total of 198 million the combined effect of the decrease in total debt along with the increase in cash resulted in a decrease to net debt of 42 5 million in q4 to a balance of 327 2 million the improvement in net debt in q4 was more than enough to offset the year to date q3 increase as net debt for the year dropped 5 3 million payments for all capital expenditures in q4 2018 were about 22 million we expect capital expenditures to continue to be in the range of 20 million to 25 million per quarter throughout 2019 as the company continues to invest in equipment to support multiple ramp ups in aec now i would like to turn it back over to olivier for some additional comments before we go to q a olivier jarrault chief executive officer thanks john now let s turn to our outlook looking at 2019 the mc business is well positioned to maintain relatively stable sales with adjusted ebitda once again higher than the historical range of 180 million to 195 million assuming no significant changes in global economic conditions or currency rates we expect 2019 adjusted ebitda to be between 195 million and 205 million in 2019 we expect aec to continue to substantially grow sales with further incremental improvement in profitability compared to 2018 full year 2019 net sales are expected to grow in the range of 20 to 25 driven by higher sales of fan blades fan cases and spacers for the leap program and components for the ch 53k f 35 and boeing 787 programs as well as by our advanced technologies development work in support of next gen engine programs adjusted ebitda as a percentage of net sales should show some incremental improvement compared to 2018 keeping aec on track toward our goal of 18 to 20 adjusted ebitda as a percentage of net sales in 2020 overall q4 was another very good quarter for the company completing a year of outstanding financial performance in both businesses mc net sales operating income and adjusted ebitda all increased in q4 and for the full year compared to 2017 with adjusted ebitda well ahead of the upper end of the historical range of 180 million to 195 million mc is well positioned for relatively stable sales in 2019 and with the potential for adjusted ebitda in 2019 between 195 million and 205 million aec had another strong quarter with growth in net sales operating income and adjusted ebitda completing a very successful year aec is expected to continue to grow substantially in 2019 with additional incremental improvement in profitability compared to the 2018 with that let s go to the line for any questions operator questions and answers operator our first question will come from the line of john franzreb with sidoti company john franzreb sidoti and company analyst i d like to start with your guidance on aec by 2020 the 500 million to 550 million i guess compared to the fall you ve taken at the bottom end of your range by about 25 million could you talk about why you did that if some programs moving forward faster than may be originally expected six months ago olivier jarrault chief executive officer yes sure our growth in 2020 is primarily driven of course to our ability to execute right on the ramp up programs on which we re very well positioned right leap of course the ch 53k the boeing 787 frames as well as the f 35 components so what we did is a very disciplined windfall a very disciplined process really understanding or reassessing as accurately as we can in fact content that we have by platform looking at the growth right expansion in 19 20 and 21 and we came back to those numbers primarily right increasing about 25 million based on those measured platforms we also took into account some very specific advanced technology development work in support of some very specific next gen jet engine program that we are working on i can t give that much detail on it but lots of activity going on the r d side of our business and all that made us feel pretty positive about a minimum of 500 million or increasing about 25 million versus our last target so 500 million to 550 million so the 550 million the upper side of the range would depend on how many new wins we could increase the share gains we could negotiate between throughout 19 on either existing programs or other platform existing platforms ramping up right so we feel pretty comfortable if you will with that john john franzreb sidoti and company analyst and talking about new wins olivier would you expect something to be announced some time in calendar 2019 in regards to new wins olivier jarrault chief executive officer we are working on a lot of different potential wins not only i would say on the engine side but also on the airframe side both commercial and defense applications we have recently actually we recently brought at aec a new vice president of global sales and we are in the process of implementing our strategy worldwide we obviously only focus on the u s market but we want to expand our activities globally in europe as well not only within the engine commercial and utility but also airframe but also equipment market and we will be announcing any potential wins right throughout 2019 as soon as it happens yes john franzreb sidoti and company analyst ok switching over to machine clothing you had a great quarter of ebitda last year you re still projecting very strong ebitda in this year but it is slightly down is that a function of your expectations that revenues might be off or is it increased commodity costs that may have to flow through the p l just why we think it d be down in any sense year over year olivier jarrault chief executive officer yes that s a good question i mean our 2018 was as you said record right record earnings right year for us and we are we think that the business i mean mc business is very well positioned in 19 to again right to again give very good financial performance right but i think to answer your question it s good to maybe look at what really happened in 18 and how we see the market going i mean early 19 right so we have in 18 we have had that you noted strong sales i talked about improvement in utilization we had as you know pretty favorable set of how could i say favorable currencies environment especially in the mexican pesos and the brazilian money and we had a fairly stable and favorable macroeconomic condition right we saw if you look back at what we talked about end of q3 and again in this quarter we saw some increases in our publications rights pmc sales especially in the second half of 18 across north america europe asia pacific driven by some specific orders especially north america we don t know if those orders will repeat or not right in 19 in addition we saw in 18 which i noted right at the end of the third quarter we saw an increase in our tissue grade pmc sales especially in north america but also in europe and asia pacific related to several specific new missions start up once again if we re going to see them in the same level in 19 we still don t know yet right so as we enter in 19 if i look at the overall macroeconomic data right we know that overall growth ended around 3 7 in 18 estimated to continue in 19 but definitely i think at the slower pace than 18 however there are significant how could i say uncertainty there is no secret that the chinese economy is slowing down in 19 it slowed down in 18 already we have the ongoing trade negotiations between china and the u s we have the undefined nature of brexit we have all those political uncertainties in several countries in europe such as france with the gilet jaunes germany with the chancellor and so on only south america is actually improving so those issues may have an impact on the global economic growth and mc in 2019 however it s very important for me to note that we continue however to believe that during the next five years the paper and paperboard production will continue to increase as recently published by risi at about 1 to 1 5 per year right about 1 4 actually percent impact backward so now if i look strictly at the pmc market if you will going into 19 right when we share with you my view right on the overview on the pmc market globally so the u s pmc market which is our largest market seems to be more or less stable due to packaging and tissues grade consumption increases offsetting more or less declines in publication grade consumption especially in newsprint switching to canada the canadian pmc market will continue to shrink we think that mainly due to continued publication grade consumption declines especially once again in newsprint we switch to brazil the pmc market will be essentially flat we believe due to favorable economic conditions but with a slowdown of export of pulp grade to china if you look at europe the european pmc market will continue to drop as a result of growth in the packaging grade consumption with machines conversions from printing and writing to packaging machines that however as i already mentioned last quarter consume less pmc than publication machines and then if you switch to asia pacific the southeast asia pmc market will be more or less stable with the china pmc market we know that it will keep on shrinking as a result of lower chinese production of packaging grades due to environmental issues and what we are hearing about ongoing restrictions on imported recycled fiber so when you look at all that if you put that into consideration we think that the mc business is well positioned to relatively keep the same level of sales and deliver good financial performance ahead of the range of 180 million to 195 million at 195 million 205 million as a result i would say of the combined effects of volume maybe a little bit of labor inflation or material inflation and as i just noted some product mix right so we will one thing for sure that we ll deliver good performance we will continue a very important point for us from a strategy standpoint we will continue our technical and service levels focused on packaging and tissue grades as we are clearly in the leadership position while of course continuing to manage a decrease in publication grades our product innovation and technology leadership and our focus on providing superior value to our customers talking about cost effective solutions i m talking about top service levels in terms of on time delivery in terms of lead time i m talking about our quality levels will be the best to resist against market pressure and will enable us to maintain our global leader position in the market right that s our view for 19 operator our next question will come from the line of christian herbosa with noble capital markets your line is open christian herbosa noble capital markets analyst hi thanks for taking my call and congrats on a great quarter olivier jarrault chief executive officer good morning chris nice to have you on the call christian herbosa noble capital markets analyst thank you so it looks like in q4 the aec segment was already close to achieving the low end of your 2020 adjusted ebitda margin target range of 18 to 20 so my question is do you think that the aec segment has the potential to improve beyond that range olivier jarrault chief executive officer well listen we have to look at the performance of this year versus performance of last year last year i believe we did in 17 once you exclude a couple of unfavorability of a couple of contracts when it was unfortunately on us we did roughly on an adjusted basis about 13 million of ebitda right or 11 we had a good i would say good operational improvement as you noted for the full year 18 63 million roughly of ebitda and 17 1 of ebitda margin that puts us i would say that positions the business properly i believe to now go from a 63 million to a roughly say 100 million right of ebitda in 2020 i think it s a very healthy goal usually the 18 to 20 right of the 500 million to 550 million range in volume so i stick on that goal once again 30 million last year 62 million this year let s keep on continuing to ramp up to execute on this multiple ramp ups to keep on deploying across all our aec plants a disciplined operational management system and you have seen that it s starting already to pay off we have brought in actually in the past five or six months a very experienced new aerospace leadership team especially on the aec side right to manage that unprecedented steep ramp up of the leap brand new leader on the operational front brand new finance leader brand new quality leader brand new lean manufacturing so we are really bringing a lot of aerospace if you will global aerospace experience at aec and i feel comfortable about that 100 million ebitda target it s a very healthy goal for 20 christian herbosa noble capital markets analyst ok great and then so i m interested in hearing a little bit more about the new product development activities in r d for the aec segment are there any particularly attractive opportunities are you able to tell us about olivier jarrault chief executive officer well there are a lot of work as i was mentioning and i cannot really publicly right talk about give you more details there s a lot of work if you will a lot of advanced technology development work that is going on in support of some very how could i say some the combination all right of next generation jet engine platforms that we ve been very much involved with and that we ll be more and more involved with it does include if you will tweaking improving our existing technologies which i call derivative technologies especially on the 3 d woven rtm resin transfer molding technology we re looking at other also other very very interesting as you know potential applications both on the commercial and the military side on the airframe side so it s all very exciting but i cannot give that many details yet until we come out with contract and so on a lot of very exciting work that really will fuel our growth in organic growth in 20 and past 20 christian herbosa noble capital markets analyst ok great i ll stay tuned then and then so the last one for me is on the leap engine program it contributed about 44 to aec sales in q4 so do you expect the leap program percentage of revenue to expand from there in 2019 olivier jarrault chief executive officer well the leap if you look at the leap the rights announced publicly by cfm right we re going in 19 with 1 800 plus right engines versus 1 118 engines delivered by cfm in 2018 that s to be compared with 459 right in 2017 then we ll go cfm is talking about a goal above 2 000 right we don t know yet the number right for 2020 so we ll keep on seeing right that increase right in leap component sales in 19 and 20 and the percentage right could stay around that range in the 40 to 45 range i mean that should be the same know that we have had a very interesting right goal on the ch 53k also and on the combined fuselage frame 53k and f 35 above 40 and you re going to start seeing continued ramp up also on those three platforms as the boeing 787 which was 14 aircraft launch in june of 19 and as the f 35 and the ch 53k right keep on expanding that d be right christian herbosa noble capital markets analyst ok great thank you that s all for me thanks for your time operator and our next question will come from the line of pete skibitski with alembic global go ahead peter skibitski alembic global analyst hey good morning guys maybe a couple of financial questions to start on the full year free cash flow results i think in terms of conversion it s about 0 6 times free cash to net income and i m wondering if you guys have a target for free cash flow conversion should we think that working capital will be a use of funds each year just because of kind of where you re at in the supply chain and kind of the nature of your receivables and contract assets performance can you give us some color on that john cozzolino chief financial officer and treasurer yes so pete this is john i ll start with that so right now when you look at the free cash we are still in the mode of fairly high capex we talked about that s probably one of the bigger factors in the cash flow at 20 million to 25 million a quarter with a good chunk of that going toward aec the real key here will be when that starts to drop off hopefully after 2019 as we have those programs ramped up at that point the free cash flow generation will grow significantly now the other part of that is the working capital we do also continue to invest in working capital to support those ramps a lot has been done to really improve the efficiency of that and we ll continue to keep looking at that but once we reach the whole ramp on these programs working capital should level off and that should also help the free cash flow so that s really where we are right now going forward olivier jarrault chief executive officer yes i think that with what we had been doing what you re starting to see in q4 right i mean we had right now a cash flow right of 42 million right in q4 we dropped down our total net debt to 327 million it s a very nice improvement for the full year right and we have 5 million in cash right in cash flow and we are as john was saying we are putting a lot of focus in the past now two quarters on the aec side to really manage much more efficiently i would say our working capital a lot of focus on inventory a lot i would say a lot of daily focus from my side directly in receivables on the aerospace side and on inventory and more and more focused throughout 2019 since we really want to ensure that the aec business focuses not only on ebitda growth on ramping up right on ramping up the volume as i just talked about and delivering a step improvement in ebitda margin toward the ebitda but also to start focusing on generating some free cash flow right that s where really my goal is right and so we have done i think a very nice improvement in q3 q4 and i think that will definitely keep on happening in 19 and 20 right ok peter skibitski alembic global analyst great i appreciate the color just to follow up on the capex side do you think that in maybe the midterm or the long term as a percentage of revenue maybe capex could come down to kind of the mid single digit level kind of when this ramp is over and also how will the potential launch of the 797 or nma how will that impact the outlook for capex olivier jarrault chief executive officer i think to answer your question i think that we view the once we have brought in the equipment to support the growth of the ch 53k the f 35 we have to keep on bringing equipment this year for the ge9x don t forget that we are right that we re producing the fan cases right of the ge9x the 777x entered in service four aircraft in 2019 but we keep on receiving equipment we re going to have to think also as you just mentioned about the potential right uhbr the nma which could play both on the engine and also on the airframe side i think about in a range of 60 million a year right i think it s a fair number to keep in mind right i mean the 60 million right for the total company right for the total company ok peter skibitski alembic global analyst yes that s very helpful last one for me and i appreciate all the color this airbus emirates news about talking about the a380 how are you guys thinking about that is it too early for you to comment on it or just wondering what the potential financial impact could be to you if the rate on the a380 isn t coming down olivier jarrault chief executive officer well i m not worried at all about the a380 it s not i mean for some of us who are doing pretty well in the aerospace industry it s not a very big news right we knew it would come one day or another right so we have a very marginal right content on the a380 so very very marginal from our salt lake city business so i mean for us it has absolutely no impact actually i look forward to an increase i would say at the airbus an increase right of the a350 because we have some potential maybe some potential business to play there right from our salt lake city business right so an increasing a350 or an increase in the rental of the a330 would be actually quite good news for us right so actually i m rather pleased with the news right ok peter skibitski alembic global analyst so i am very active i am rather pleased with the weather news i got it i got it very helpful thank you guys olivier jarrault chief executive officer ok you re very welcome nice to talk to you operator we ll go next to the line of mitchell grivec with thai capital go ahead unknown analyst good morning olivier jarrault chief executive officer good morning nice to have you unknown analyst thank you so you talked about a lot of so you called and talked about the possibility of new wins in the future just based on the pipeline can you give us a range of what that those new wins could equate to as far as dollar size olivier jarrault chief executive officer well first of all you have to think about which horizon right where you re thinking about right i mean actually i think if you i guess your question is more related to 2020 right unknown analyst and beyond yes olivier jarrault chief executive officer yes in 2020 i would say that depending on the timing right of those anticipated new share gains or new first time content acquisition on existing platforms that are ramping up today i think if everything was to materialize on time the probability right that we took in our calculation that would give us roughly that will bring us to the upper side of my range right of 550 million it s about 25 million right either side right toward the 550 million that s what i view as of today right unknown analyst ok all right thank you operator we do have a follow up question from the line of john franzreb with sidoti company go ahead please john franzreb sidoti and company analyst maybe to ask a previous question a different way the target margin for aec has been that range for a while olivier when you were at alcoa you were known for improving productivity at existing operations you ve been there a year now my question is do you think that the aec business is operating at optimal productivity or is there margin improvement opportunity based on your view of how the business is performing right now versus maybe a couple of years from now olivier jarrault chief executive officer listen i mean there are always productivity improvement to be achieved right and i think listen how could i summarize it i feel much more comfortable today about the 100 million ebitda target in 20 than i was a year ago when i saw the business operating at 30 million ebitda right and 11 ebitda margin right so i think you ll agree with me that all the system that we have deployed all the metrics and all our operating system that we have put in place drew right double right acquisition volume as well but executing on the ramp up plus putting the productivity programs in place helped us going to 63 million right so that s about 17 1 if i look at my past experience right of ebitda margin experience of improvement across aerospace businesses i think that targeting a point to a point and a half right of ebitda improvement is a good range right it s a good that s what i ve been doing the past 10 15 years across casting businesses forging businesses fastening and so on so with 17 at 1 5 to about 3 points max right that s why i m pretty comfortable about the delivering right in the 18 to 20 range right and then from there we ll continue growing right in the out years john franzreb sidoti and company analyst ok fair enough i ll give it a shot thank you operator we have no further questions in queue at this time you may proceed olivier jarrault chief executive officer well again thank you all for joining the call we appreciate your time today and your continued interest in albany international i would like also to congratulate my albany team on a strong finish to 2018 thank you operator duration 51 minutes call participants john

directly comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities refer to the tables in the section titled non ifrs measures in our year end 2018 management s discussion analysis for details of these adjustments operational results our lumber segment generated an operating loss of 22 million q3 18 233 million income and adjusted ebitda of 68 million q3 18 339 million this quarter s results were unfavorably impacted by the significant decline in lumber prices a decline in shipment volumes log cost inflation in british columbia and persistent wet weather in the u s south that affected log availability and pricing realized lumber prices were 21 lower than the third quarter which impacted adjusted ebitda for the segment by 201 million in the fourth quarter the differential between syp narrow and wide dimension products increased relative to the third quarter which also contributed to the decline in the realized price lumber shipments declined approximately 10 from the third quarter as spf shipments were higher in q2 and q3 due to backlogs from earlier in the year and due to wet weather in u s south which impacted construction job site activity in addition markets for lumber were softer in the fourth quarter of 2018 as new home construction eased in the second half of 2018 compared to its strong start in the first half of 2018 the decline in shipment volumes negatively impacted adjusted ebitda by a further 35 million compared to the third quarter of 2018 costs net of other revenues and before duties expense were approximately 5 higher than the third quarter which impacted earnings by an additional 35 million higher log costs maintenance downtime commissioning of capital projects temporary curtailments and production schedules that were interrupted by wet weather in the u s south all contributed to the increase in costs our panels segment generated operating earnings in the quarter of 4 million q3 18 31 million and adjusted ebitda of 9 million q3 18 34 million pricing in the plywood market was significantly softer in the fourth quarter of 2018 as compared to the prior quarter and the prior year our pulp paper segment generated operating earnings of

production challenges that reduced our production and shipments from the levels achieved in the third quarter pulp prices declined in q4 as growing inventories tempered demand which also reduced earnings outlook despite the record results 2018 was a challenging year for west fraser poor weather conditions and transportation difficulties early in 2018 impacted production and shipments which caused extreme volatility in lumber price and order patterns our year over year lumber production increase of 376 mmfbm came largely from the 2017 acquisition of the gilman mills and was offset by challenges across our mills we completed the modernization of our high prairie alberta sawmill and are in the process of ramping up our new sawmill at opelika alabama we also completed a number of other productivity projects including additional continuous dry kilns pulp refining upgrades and sawmill modernization projects we remain convinced of potential for further improvement in all our

company increased to 228 9 million compared to 169 4 million last year mc finished the year strong with adjusted ebitda of 51 2 million bringing the full year total to 212 1 million both results were significant improvements over last year aec adjusted ebitda in q4 was 18 1 million and 63 3 million for the year aec adjusted ebitda as a percentage of net sales in 2018 improved to 17 1 moving on to slide 7 earnings per share net income attributable to the company in q4 was 0 55 per share compared to 0 18 per share in q4 of last year excluding adjustments for restructuring tax items currency revaluation and the net impact of a pension settlement charge and a curtailment gain net income attributable to the company was 0 74 per share in q4 compared to 0 44 per share last year on a full year basis net income attributable to the company excluding adjustments was 2 82 per share in 2018 compared to 1 67 per share last year slide 8 shows our total debt and net debt cash flows were very good in q4 which included the impact of improved working capital during the quarter as a result total debt decreased just over 5 million to a balance of 525 million at the end of the year while cash balances increased about 37 million to a total of 198 million the combined effect of the decrease in total debt along with the increase in cash resulted in a decrease to net debt of 42 5 million in q4 to a balance of 327 2 million the improvement in net debt in q4 was more than enough to offset the year to date q3 increase as net debt for the year dropped 5 3 million payments for all capital expenditures in q4 2018 were about 22 million advertisement advertisement we expect capital expenditures to continue to be in the range of 20 million to 25 million per quarter throughout 2019 as the company continues to invest in equipment to support multiple ramp ups in aec now i would like to turn it back over to olivier for some additional comments before we go to q a olivier jarrault chief executive officer thanks john now let s turn to our outlook looking at 2019 the mc business is well positioned to maintain relatively stable sales with adjusted ebitda once again higher than the historical range of 180 million to 195 million assuming no significant changes in global economic conditions or currency rates we expect 2019 adjusted ebitda to be between 195 million and 205 million in 2019 we expect aec to continue to substantially grow sales with further incremental improvement in profitability compared to 2018 full year 2019 net sales are expected to grow in the range of 20 to 25 driven by higher sales of fan blades fan cases and spacers for the leap program and components for the ch 53k f 35 and boeing 787 programs as well as by our advanced technologies development work in support of next gen engine programs adjusted ebitda as a percentage of net sales should show some incremental improvement compared to 2018 keeping aec on track toward our goal of 18 to 20 adjusted ebitda as a percentage of net sales in 2020 overall q4 was another very good quarter for the company completing a year of outstanding financial performance in both businesses advertisement advertisement mc net sales operating income and adjusted ebitda all increased in q4 and for the full year compared to 2017 with adjusted ebitda well ahead of the upper end of the historical range of 180 million to 195 million mc is well positioned for relatively stable sales in 2019 and with the potential for adjusted ebitda in 2019 between 195 million and 205 million aec had another strong quarter with growth in net sales operating income and adjusted ebitda completing a very successful year aec is expected to continue to grow substantially in 2019 with additional incremental improvement in profitability compared to the 2018 with that let s go to the line for any questions operator questions and answers operator our first question will come from the line of john franzreb with sidoti company advertisement advertisement john franzreb sidoti and company analyst i d like to start with your guidance on aec by 2020 the 500 million to 550 million i guess compared to the fall you ve taken at the bottom end of your range by about 25 million could you talk about why you did that if some programs moving forward faster than may be originally expected six months ago olivier jarrault chief executive officer yes sure our growth in 2020 is primarily driven of course to our ability to execute right on the ramp up programs on which we re very well positioned right leap of course the ch 53k the boeing 787 frames as well as the f 35 components so what we did is a very disciplined windfall a very disciplined process really understanding or reassessing as accurately as we can in fact content that we have by platform looking at the growth right expansion in 19 20 and 21 and we came back to those numbers primarily right increasing about 25 million based on those measured platforms we also took into account some very specific advanced technology development work in support of some very specific next gen jet engine program that we are working on i can t give that much detail on it but lots of activity going on the r d side of our business and all that made us feel pretty positive about a minimum of 500 million or increasing about 25 million versus our last target so 500 million to 550 million so the 550 million the upper side of the range would depend on how many new wins we could increase the share gains we could negotiate between throughout 19 on either existing programs or other platform existing platforms ramping up right so we feel pretty comfortable if you will with that john john franzreb sidoti and company analyst and talking about new wins olivier would you expect something to be announced some time in calendar 2019 in regards to new wins olivier jarrault chief executive officer we are working on a lot of different potential wins not only i would say on the engine side but also on the airframe side both commercial and defense applications we have recently actually we recently brought at aec a new vice president of global sales and we are in the process of implementing our strategy worldwide we obviously only focus on the u s market but we want to expand our activities globally in europe as well not only within the engine commercial and utility but also airframe but also equipment market and we will be announcing any potential wins right throughout 2019 as soon as it happens yes john franzreb sidoti and company analyst ok switching over to machine clothing you had a great quarter of ebitda last year you re still projecting very strong ebitda in this year but it is slightly down is that a function of your expectations that revenues might be off or is it increased commodity costs that may have to flow through the p l just why we think it d be down in any sense year over year olivier jarrault chief executive officer yes that s a good question i mean our 2018 was as you said record right record earnings right year for us and we are we think that the business i mean mc business is very well positioned in 19 to again right to again give very good financial performance right but i think to answer your question it s good to maybe look at what really happened in 18 and how we see the market going i mean early 19 right so we have in 18 we have had that you noted strong sales i talked about improvement in utilization we had as you know pretty favorable set of how could i say favorable currencies environment especially in the mexican pesos and the brazilian money and we had a fairly stable and favorable macroeconomic condition right we saw if you look back at what we talked about end of q3 and again in this quarter we saw some increases in our publications rights pmc sales especially in the second half of 18 across north america europe asia pacific driven by some specific orders especially north america we don t know if those orders will repeat or not right in 19 in addition we saw in 18 which i noted right at the end of the third quarter we saw an increase in our tissue grade pmc sales especially in north america but also in europe and asia pacific related to several specific new missions start up once again if we re going to see them in the same level in 19 we still don t know yet right so as we enter in 19 if i look at the overall macroeconomic data right we know that overall growth ended around 3 7 in 18 estimated to continue in 19 but definitely i think at the slower pace than 18 however there are significant how could i say uncertainty there is no secret that the chinese economy is slowing down in 19 it slowed down in 18 already we have the ongoing trade negotiations between china and the u s we have the undefined nature of brexit we have all those political uncertainties in several countries in europe such as france with the gilet jaunes germany with the chancellor and so on only south america is actually improving so those issues may have an impact on the global economic growth and mc in 2019 however it s very important for me to note that we continue however to believe that during the next five years the paper and paperboard production will continue to increase as recently published by risi at about 1 to 1 5 per year right about 1 4 actually percent impact backward so now if i look strictly at the pmc market if you will going into 19 right when we share with you my view right on the overview on the pmc market globally so the u s pmc market which is our largest market seems to be more or less stable due to packaging and tissues grade consumption increases offsetting more or less declines in publication grade consumption especially in newsprint switching to canada the canadian pmc market will continue to shrink we think that mainly due to continued publication grade consumption declines especially once again in newsprint we switch to brazil the pmc market will be essentially flat we believe due to favorable economic conditions but with a slowdown of export of pulp grade to china if you look at europe the european pmc market will continue to drop as a result of growth in the packaging grade consumption with machines conversions from printing and writing to packaging machines that however as i already mentioned last quarter consume less pmc than publication machines and then if you switch to asia pacific the southeast asia pmc market will be more or less stable with the china pmc market we know that it will keep on shrinking as a result of lower chinese production of packaging grades due to environmental issues and what we are hearing about ongoing restrictions on imported recycled fiber so when you look at all that if you put that into consideration we think that the mc business is well positioned to relatively keep the same level of sales and deliver good financial performance ahead of the range of 180 million to 195 million at 195 million 205 million as a result i would say of the combined effects of volume maybe a little bit of labor inflation or material inflation and as i just noted some product mix right so we will one thing for sure that we ll deliver good performance we will continue a very important point for us from a strategy standpoint we will continue our technical and service levels focused on packaging and tissue grades as we are clearly in the leadership position while of course continuing to manage a decrease in publication grades our product innovation and technology leadership and our focus on providing superior value to our customers talking about cost effective solutions i m talking about top service levels in terms of on time delivery in terms of lead time i m talking about our quality levels will be the best to resist against market pressure and will enable us to maintain our global leader position in the market right that s our view for 19 operator our next question will come from the line of christian herbosa with noble capital markets your line is open christian herbosa noble capital markets analyst hi thanks for taking my call and congrats on a great quarter olivier jarrault chief executive officer good morning chris nice to have you on the call christian herbosa noble capital markets analyst thank you so it looks like in q4 the aec segment was already close to achieving the low end of your 2020 adjusted ebitda margin target range of 18 to 20 so my question is do you think that the aec segment has the potential to improve beyond that range olivier jarrault chief executive officer well listen we have to look at the performance of this year versus performance of last year last year i believe we did in 17 once you exclude a couple of unfavorability of a couple of contracts when it was unfortunately on us we did roughly on an adjusted basis about 13 million of ebitda right or 11 we had a good i would say good operational improvement as you noted for the full year 18 63 million roughly of ebitda and 17 1 of ebitda margin that puts us i would say that positions the business properly i believe to now go from a 63 million to a roughly say 100 million right of ebitda in 2020 i think it s a very healthy goal usually the 18 to 20 right of the 500 million to 550 million range in volume so i stick on that goal once again 30 million last year 62 million this year let s keep on continuing to ramp up to execute on this multiple ramp ups to keep on deploying across all our aec plants a disciplined operational management system and you have seen that it s starting already to pay off we have brought in actually in the past five or six months a very experienced new aerospace leadership team especially on the aec side right to manage that unprecedented steep ramp up of the leap brand new leader on the operational front brand new finance leader brand new quality leader brand new lean manufacturing so we are really bringing a lot of aerospace if you will global aerospace experience at aec and i feel comfortable about that 100 million ebitda target it s a very healthy goal for 20 christian herbosa noble capital markets analyst ok great and then so i m interested in hearing a little bit more about the new product development activities in r d for the aec segment are there any particularly attractive opportunities are you able to tell us about olivier jarrault chief executive officer well there are a lot of work as i was mentioning and i cannot really publicly right talk about give you more details there s a lot of work if you will a lot of advanced technology development work that is going on in support of some very how could i say some the combination all right of next generation jet engine platforms that we ve been very much involved with and that we ll be more and more involved with it does include if you will tweaking improving our existing technologies which i call derivative technologies especially on the 3 d woven rtm resin transfer molding technology we re looking at other also other very very interesting as you know potential applications both on the commercial and the military side on the airframe side so it s all very exciting but i cannot give that many details yet until we come out with contract and so on a lot of very exciting work that really will fuel our growth in organic growth in 20 and past 20 christian herbosa noble capital markets analyst ok great i ll stay tuned then and then so the last one for me is on the leap engine program it contributed about 44 to aec sales in q4 so do you expect the leap program percentage of revenue to expand from there in 2019 olivier jarrault chief executive officer well the leap if you look at the leap the rights announced publicly by cfm right we re going in 19 with 1 800 plus right engines versus 1 118 engines delivered by cfm in 2018 that s to be compared with 459 right in 2017 then we ll go cfm is talking about a goal above 2 000 right we don t know yet the number right for 2020 so we ll keep on seeing right that increase right in leap component sales in 19 and 20 and the percentage right could stay around that range in the 40 to 45 range i mean that should be the same know that we have had a very interesting right goal on the ch 53k also and on the combined fuselage frame 53k and f 35 above 40 and you re going to start seeing continued ramp up also on those three platforms as the boeing 787 which was 14 aircraft launch in june of 19 and as the f 35 and the ch 53k right keep on expanding that d be right christian herbosa noble capital markets analyst ok great thank you that s all for me thanks for your time operator and our next question will come from the line of pete skibitski with alembic global go ahead peter skibitski alembic global analyst hey good morning guys maybe a couple of financial questions to start on the full year free cash flow results i think in terms of conversion it s about 0 6 times free cash to net income and i m wondering if you guys have a target for free cash flow conversion should we think that working capital will be a use of funds each year just because of kind of where you re at in the supply chain and kind of the nature of your receivables and contract assets performance can you give us some color on that john cozzolino chief financial officer and treasurer yes so pete this is john i ll start with that so right now when you look at the free cash we are still in the mode of fairly high capex we talked about that s probably one of the bigger factors in the cash flow at 20 million to 25 million a quarter with a good chunk of that going toward aec the real key here will be when that starts to drop off hopefully after 2019 as we have those programs ramped up at that point the free cash flow generation will grow significantly now the other part of that is the working capital we do also continue to invest in working capital to support those ramps a lot has been done to really improve the efficiency of that and we ll continue to keep looking at that but once we reach the whole ramp on these programs working capital should level off and that should also help the free cash flow so that s really where we are right now going forward olivier jarrault chief executive officer yes i think that with what we had been doing what you re starting to see in q4 right i mean we had right now a cash flow right of 42 million right in q4 we dropped down our total net debt to 327 million it s a very nice improvement for the full year right and we have 5 million in cash right in cash flow and we are as john was saying we are putting a lot of focus in the past now two quarters on the aec side to really manage much more efficiently i would say our working capital a lot of focus on inventory a lot i would say a lot of daily focus from my side directly in receivables on the aerospace side and on inventory and more and more focused throughout 2019 since we really want to ensure that the aec business focuses not only on ebitda growth on ramping up right on ramping up the volume as i just talked about and delivering a step improvement in ebitda margin toward the ebitda but also to start focusing on generating some free cash flow right that s where really my goal is right and so we have done i think a very nice improvement in q3 q4 and i think that will definitely keep on happening in 19 and 20 right ok peter skibitski alembic global analyst great i appreciate the color just to follow up on the capex side do you think that in maybe the midterm or the long term as a percentage of revenue maybe capex could come down to kind of the mid single digit level kind of when this ramp is over and also how will the potential launch of the 797 or nma how will that impact the outlook for capex olivier jarrault chief executive officer i think to answer your question i think that we view the once we have brought in the equipment to support the growth of the ch 53k the f 35 we have to keep on bringing equipment this year for the ge9x don t forget that we are right that we re producing the fan cases right of the ge9x the 777x entered in service four aircraft in 2019 but we keep on receiving equipment we re going to have to think also as you just mentioned about the potential right uhbr the nma which could play both on the engine and also on the airframe side i think about in a range of 60 million a year right i think it s a fair number to keep in mind right i mean the 60 million right for the total company right for the total company ok peter skibitski alembic global analyst yes that s very helpful last one for me and i appreciate all the color this airbus emirates news about talking about the a380 how are you guys thinking about that is it too early for you to comment on it or just wondering what the potential financial impact could be to you if the rate on the a380 isn t coming down olivier jarrault chief executive officer well i m not worried at all about the a380 it s not i mean for some of us who are doing pretty well in the aerospace industry it s not a very big news right we knew it would come one day or another right so we have a very marginal right content on the a380 so very very marginal from our salt lake city business so i mean for us it has absolutely no impact actually i look forward to an increase i would say at the airbus an increase right of the a350 because we have some potential maybe some potential business to play there right from our salt lake city business right so an increasing a350 or an increase in the rental of the a330 would be actually quite good news for us right so actually i m rather pleased with the news right ok peter skibitski alembic global analyst so i am very active i am rather pleased with the weather news i got it i got it very helpful thank you guys olivier jarrault chief executive officer ok you re very welcome nice to talk to you operator we ll go next to the line of mitchell grivec with thai capital go ahead unknown analyst good morning olivier jarrault chief executive officer good morning nice to have you unknown analyst thank you so you talked about a lot of so you called and talked about the possibility of new wins in the future just based on the pipeline can you give us a range of what that those new wins could equate to as far as dollar size olivier jarrault chief executive officer well first of all you have to think about which horizon right where you re thinking about right i mean actually i think if you i guess your question is more related to 2020 right unknown analyst and beyond yes olivier jarrault chief executive officer yes in 2020 i would say that depending on the timing right of those anticipated new share gains or new first time content acquisition on existing platforms that are ramping up today i think if everything was to materialize on time the probability right that we took in our calculation that would give us roughly that will bring us to the upper side of my range right of 550 million it s about 25 million right either side right toward the 550 million that s what i view as of today right unknown analyst ok all right thank you operator we do have a follow up question from the line of john franzreb with sidoti company go ahead please john franzreb sidoti and company analyst maybe to ask a previous question a different way the target margin for aec has been that range for a while olivier when you were at alcoa you were known for improving productivity at existing operations you ve been there a year now my question is do you think that the aec business is operating at optimal productivity or is there margin improvement opportunity based on your view of how the business is performing right now versus maybe a couple of years from now olivier jarrault chief executive officer listen i mean there are always productivity improvement to be achieved right and i think listen how could i summarize it i feel much more comfortable today about the 100 million ebitda target in 20 than i was a year ago when i saw the business operating at 30 million ebitda right and 11 ebitda margin right so i think you ll agree with me that all the system that we have deployed all the metrics and all our operating system that we have put in place drew right double right acquisition volume as well but executing on the ramp up plus putting the productivity programs in place helped us going to 63 million right so that s about 17 1 if i look at my past experience right of ebitda margin experience of improvement across aerospace businesses i think that targeting a point to a point and a half right of ebitda improvement is a good range right it s a good that s what i ve been doing the past 10 15 years across casting businesses forging businesses fastening and so on so with 17 at 1 5 to about 3 points max right that s why i m pretty comfortable about the delivering right in the 18 to 20 range right and then from there we ll continue growing right in the out years john franzreb sidoti and company analyst ok fair enough i ll give it a shot thank you operator we have no further questions in queue at this time you may proceed olivier jarrault chief executive officer well again thank you all for joining the call we appreciate your time today and your continued interest in albany international i would like also to congratulate my albany team on a strong finish to 2018 thank you operator duration 51 minutes call participants john

new york meri kassmer didn t want anything fancy a house in the suburbs a reliable car in the driveway and the occasional family vacation but there s no house only a basement apartment in locust valley where she lives alone and no vacations to speak of at 38 kassmer is struggling to pay off 40 000 in student loans for a bachelor s degree in elementary education that she doesn t use anymore she started off more than 60 000 in debt from her days at suny old westbury i feel like i am swimming and can t keep my head above water and can t get air said kassmer who taught preschoolers for five years before taking a higher paying job as an emergency medical technician at a construction site it affects all aspects of my life kassmer is far from alone countless long island millennials and their parents are facing tens of thousands of dollars in college debt according to federal data and financial experts and their burden is made even heavier by the region s high cost of living local economic numbers show over the past 25 years the one two punch has made it a struggle to keep younger long islanders from moving away in 1990 the number of 25 to 34 year olds hit a peak of 430 400 by 2016 the total stood at about 327 250 and two thirds still lived at home census figures show simultaneously tuitions climbed at some schools to cover slashes in public funding at others to defray rising expenses or offer more amenities to attract more students government and high education studies showed long island s average student loan balance stood at 32 400 in 2016 eclipsing both the state and national averages of 31 600 and 29 900 respectively according to the latest data available from the federal reserve of new york those five and six figure ious have many like kassmer walking a financial tightrope without a net forcing them to put off buying a home a new car and even getting married and having kids the financial experts said and putting life on hold can last decades the federal government for example lets a borrower of 30 000 take as long as 25 years to settle the debt for a private loan the repayment term can vary from five to 20 years government figures show it s just obvious that if you have to pay a couple hundred a month for student loans you have less money for other things said sandy baum an economist at the washington based urban institute who specializes in higher education finance living with the folks borrowers nationwide are playing out their lives much like kassmer is surveys show six out of 10 have less than 1 000 in their checking accounts because of college debt and one in three pays more monthly on student loans than on rent according to 7 000 borrowers surveyed last fall by student debt crisis a manhattan based nonprofit group that wants to make college free consequently the report said the borrowers frequently find themselves forced to hit the brakes on marriage children and a house the numbers are sobering especially for homeownership the survey showed while one in five has delayed saying i do and one in four is holding off on parenthood better than half have ruled out buying a home according to the report in no small part the reduced rate of homeownership is the upshot of a doubling in the average student loan balance in the last decade from about 5 000 to 10 000 nationwide the federal reserve found locally the figure jumped from 20 800 to 32 400 or nearly 56 percent according to the fed s new york bank by the fed s calculations more than 400 000 young adults across the country would be homeowners today if they weren t carrying such big balances long island is a textbook example of the fallout of every 10 millennials here six are living with their parents or roommates and only two own a home according to census data analyzed by the long island association the region s largest business group these are pretty unpleasant decisions said john rizzo lia s chief economist you could be 30 year old and still living at home you re stuck with this debt it s better to stay home and live with your parents those shifts in living arrangements reflect not only the bigger average student loan balance but a 20 percent decline in median salaries and a 150 percent uptick in real estate prices over the past 40 years the analysis showed jonathan meneses is what he calls well compensated for his job as an it manager but he and his wife still delayed buying a home for three years because of college debt now they have a home in east rockaway the debt has really taken away years of earnings that could have been used for buying a house earlier or put away for a rainy day said meneses 29 a 2011 graduate of the new york institute of technology in old westbury we try not to live beyond our means but with the way student loans are structured we in the end do feel trapped he said nikki taylor friedman has a unique perspective on young people and homebuying being a young adult herself and a real estate agent for douglas elliman they re not willing to put themselves further in debt said friedman 23 who is based in douglas elliman s huntington office millennials still want to save for the american dream they just want to pay off their debt first do the math the crisis has been deepening for more than a decade mostly the result of cuts in education funding spurred by the 2008 recession and higher costs for colleges and universities tied to attracting students experts said steve von bargen of massapequa can speak to the impact of the recession after the stock market crashed he and his wife had to rely heavily on loans to pay for the undergraduate degrees that they had promised their three children we can t go on vacation said von bargen 58 we used to buy a car every five to six years now our cars are a decade old then two of the three von bargen kids went on to graduate school on their own dime all together von bargen estimates the trio incurred hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt although he declined to provide an exact figure today they all have jobs and live on their own but that s not the case for many of their peers he said it s an epidemic he said you look at my street everybody s living at home as the rocky economy recovered tuitions inched up year by year for both private and public colleges and universities numbers show editors begin optional trim on long island for example the average undergraduate tuition for 11 public and private colleges increased roughly 50 percent from 14 515 in 2008 09 to 21 960 this school year according to numbers not adjusted for inflation students also are responsible for room and board as well as fees and books tuition increases have helped schools both close the gap created by cuts in government subsidies and stay competitive by paying for everything from technology upgrades and health care costs to new construction and top notch professors in new york support from albany for the state s 64 public universities has stayed flat and aid for the system s two year community colleges including the ones in nassau and suffolk counties is based on enrollment and many have seen declines in the number of students stony brook university for example has seen its state funding drop from 190 million in 2008 09 to 147 million this year said braden hosch assistant vice president for institutional research planning and effectiveness and despite belt tightening at the 26 000 student university hosch said ultimately the students have been asked to make up for the gap that the state has not been able to fill still hosch contends that stony brook remains affordable of bachelor s degree recipients who started as freshmen at the university almost half graduate debt free by patching together grants and help from family members he said end optional trim the amount of debt a long island graduate walks away with often depends on whether the school is private or public numbers show adelphi university is a private institution in garden city the median debt for an undergraduate degree increased almost two thirds in a decade from 15 518 in 2007 to 25 000 in 2017 numbers show conversely suny old westbury and the two year suffolk community college are public and had lower median debts suny old westbury saw its median debt increase 26 percent from 13 500 to 17 000 suffolk community college graduates left 7 000 in debt up more than 34 percent from just over 5 200 gail eyl of baldwin sent her children to private college in the late 1990s a decision she is still paying for every month the mother of four puts 550 toward her 25 000 loan balance the debt has forced eyl at 66 to postpone retirement from her career as an interior designer i want to do something else she said it would be nice to have that extra money every month i haven t gone on a vacation in five years pain vs gain so is it worth it to take on tens of thousands of dollars of debt that ultimately will take decades to pay off absolutely experts agreed they re not just throwing away their money said liang zhang a professor of higher education at new york university they benefit from the investment in human capital i think the research has consistently demonstrated that a college education matters it pays off government statistics prove zhang s point in 2017 the median weekly earnings for bachelor s degree recipients was 1 173 compared with 836 for those with an associate degree 712 for high school graduates and 520 for high school dropouts according to u s department of labor and while college graduates are waiting longer to buy a home zhang said many end up buying a more expensive property because of their higher earning power still zhang said students need to consider the return on investment when they borrow for a college degree those who fail to plan properly run the risk of default he said on long island 9 3 percent of borrowers in 2016 were considered seriously delinquent on their student loan debt compared with 12 1 percent statewide and 15 6 percent across the country according to the federal reserve bank of new york for commercial lender dave barry student loans were a necessary evil to get his college degree so he could earn enough to support his family barry who lives in islip is still paying off debt that he started to amass when he was a student at suffolk community college in the mid 1980s a decade later barry graduated with a bachelor s degree from hofstra university then he spent 18 months at concord law school in los angeles but didn t finish the final bill roughly 70 000 which barry estimates he has pared down to about 20 000 it s a double edged sword said barry 54 who expects to delay his retirement from td bank by at least three years to pay off his student loans there s a sense of accomplishment that i am paying the loans down myself but i don t see how my daughter can ever be successful in this environment barry s daughter kaytie is a senior at penn state university studying broadcast journalism her college debt is roughly 160 000 it does not seem like it will ever end he said how to repay your student loan whether you borrowed from the federal government or a private bank make your monthly payment or you ll be considered delinquent and you don t want that to happen delinquent loans eventually go into default which makes the entire loan balance immediately due opt for standard repayment a fixed amount each month until the loan is paid in full extended repayment means you pay a fixed annual or graduated amount over a period not to exceed 25 years this means smaller payments but you ultimately pay more in interest graduated repayment allows for low payments in the beginning that increase every two years up to 10 years choose an income based repayment option consolidate multiple loans into one monthly payment create a personalized repayment action plan with the state s online loan repayment advisor tool at www hesc ny gov source new york state higher education services corporation kinds of loans there are two types of student loans federal and private federal loans the federal government makes four kinds of direct loans subsidized unsubsidized ones for graduate and professional students and ones for parents a subsidized loan is one based on financial need and the government pays the interest while the borrower is in school they may include benefits such as fixed interest rates and income driven repayment plans and they don t come due until after the borrower graduates or leaves school terms and conditions are set by law private loans a private organization such as a bank is the lender and sets the loan s terms and conditions interest rates can be variable or fixed repayment can start while the borrower is still in school

policymakers will have to make hard choices on how to manage the currency particularly on whether to hike or cut interest rates when core elements of the economic model will be under fire markets have traditionally been tolerant of u k debt and deficit levels because the country was a prime venue for foreign direct investment from big companies such as airbus and nissan but these are now in question as bank of england governor mark carney put it britain relies on the kindness of strangers this has been drying up because the u k is becoming a less attractive investment destination outside the eu single market foreign direct investment more than halved to 15 1 billion in 2017 from 32 7 billion in 2015 according to u n figures here s our look at the five responses that the u k will need to consider all have disadvantages 1 drop import tariffs to avoid big price hikes if britain leaves the eu without a deal tariffs would be imposed on imports that used to come in freely from the eu for example britain s tariff on beef purchases would be around 40 percent to avoid food price inflation britain could lower or completely scrap tariffs on things such as food car parts or medicines catch no 1 the world trade organization s most favored nation principle dictates that these tariffs must be the same for all wto members unless you re in a trade deal or in a regional bloc like the eu this means not only french but also south american beef or cheese would come to britain tariff free
president trump has finally given investors a good reason to buy us dollars after months of confrontational language he s softening his tone on trade and getting close to signing a border deal that would end the funding crisis it is not yet a done deal but it needs to be approved by congress by friday and signed by the president by saturday to keep the government running although trump expressed some initial dissatisfaction with the agreement as it only provides funding for 55 miles of new barriers along the southern border he hasn t said much beyond that everyone from the democrats to republicans and the president want to avoid another shutdown so despite his lack of commitment all signs point to an agreement because in trump s own words a shutdown would be a terrible thing he s even downplayed the lack of wall funding when he tweeted yesterday that the deal will provide almost 23b in border security with the us funding crisis behind us investors will be focus on trade and according to trump the trade deal with china is going very well chinese president xi is expected to meet with mnuchin and lighthizer on friday in return for trump receiving vice premier liu he in washington during his visit to the us trump s flexibility with the march 1st deadline is also a step in the right direction and according to a spokesman for the usda the two presidents could meet in march today s us cpi report did not curtail the dollar s rally even though cpi growth stagnated for the second month in a row in january year over year price growth slowed to 1 6 from 1 9 ppi retail sales and jobless claims are scheduled for due for release tomorrow and while investors expect spending growth to slow higher wages and solid holiday shopping means the report could beat which would drive usd jpy comfortably above 111 the worst performing currency today was the euro which gave up yesterday s gains to end the ny session at its lows there are no shortages of reasons for the euro s decline but the biggest pressure comes from continued softness in ez data us budget deal optimism lifting usd lower german yields prospect of weaker ez gdp tomorrow political trouble in spain although industrial production fell more than expected the sell off was driven by the rising dollar and political trouble in spain parliament rejected the government s 2019 budget bill forcing the prime minister to consider an early general election this last time this happened was more than 2 decades ago prime minister sanchez is expected to make a decision on calling the elections by friday and if his government falls a right wing coalition government could take over which would be very bad for the euro german and eurozone fourth quarter gdp numbers are due for release on thursday and given the sharp decline in retail sales and the central bank s general concerns the risk is to the downside meanwhile sterling u turned after hitting a high of 1 2960 it was no surprise to see inflation fall more than expected in january and for the year over year rate to slip underneath 2 in the past week theresa may asked parliament for 2 more weeks reaffirmed her commitment to leaving the eu on march 29th and said no deal is still on the table the labour party doesn t want the prime minister to run down the clock and are pushing for a hard stop of february 26th on her process she ll need to either present her new deal for vote or allow parliament to take control given the resistance of the eu tory brexiters and other parties may is setting up for defeat which is why we continue to believe that sterling should be trading lower and not higher the best performing currency today was the new zealand dollar but all of its gains were made right after the reserve bank of new zealand s monetary policy announcement apparently investors felt that the rbnz was not dovish enough even though they pushed back their forecast for a rate increase to early 2021 and said they plan to keep interest rates at its current level through 2019 and 2020 part of the reason is because the central bank sees growth picking up this year with employment near maximum sustainable level while a rate cut may be needed if growth doesn t accelerate rbnz governor orr did not feel that the chance of easing increased over the past 3 months the australian and canadian dollars were virtually unchanged with stronger consumer confidence supporting aud and higher oil prices limiting the slide in the loonie

call over to bryan deboer president and ceo bryan b deboer chief executive officer and president thank you megan good morning and thank you for joining us today earlier today we reported the highest adjusted fourth quarter earnings in company history 2 57 per share a 20 increase over the fourth quarter of 2017 full year adjusted eps was 9 98 a 19 increase over last year our earnings improvement was driven by strong top line gross profit growth both up 17 full year revenues were 11 8 billion and we delivered double digit revenue increases in all business lines we remain focused on our core strategy of purchasing strong assets that have yet to realize their full potential to achieve operational excellence throughout our network these efforts will drive the realization of the 250 million in incremental ebitda potential within our existing store base this creates a clear line of sight to 15 in eps and provide the additional capital necessary to accelerate consolidation within our highly fragmented industry in just a few minutes chris will be providing more details on 2018 and how our teams are delivering operational excellence through their 2019 annual operating plan as mentioned in our press release john is resigning on march 1st i would like to thank john for a fun and productive 17 years together at lithia we will miss him and wish him great success in his future endeavors in addition i want to congratulate our 36 circle of champion winners as our highest performing stores in 2018 thank you we also invited two additional general managers to our lithia partners group recognition as an lpg member is a highly coveted position at lithia and represents the pinnacle of our mission growth powered by people our people have positioned us to drive both traditional m a and innovation in the years to come in the past five years we have achieved both revenue and earnings compound annual growth rates of over 20 our history of running a hyper growth company that is accelerating earnings is a unique differentiator for lithia in addition to this growth we continue to maintain sector leading operational metrics the automotive retail business remains unconsolidated in 2018 nationally we achieved over 1 of the new car market share and approximately 1 5 of used car market share despite being one of the largest vehicle retailers in the country looking forward we see that technology and innovation combined with the nationwide network can provide the advantages necessary to gain meaningful market share in the future in 2018 we acquired 1 4 billion annualized revenue and made investments in innovation to access consumers through new and alternative channel we continue to monitor over 2 600 acquisition targets and other strategic opportunities that meet our strict return on equity hurdles our value based investment strategy has an 80 success rate in achieving 15 to 20 after tax returns on seasoned stores meaning within five years of acquisition this is an exciting time for both retail and transportation and we are well positioned to lead the way as both continue to modernize our history of successful growth and operational excellence generates over 300 million in free cash flow annually that enables us to expand and diversify we pursue innovation and diversification strategy in the following order first we drive improvement in our existing business next we consider vertical and horizontal adjacencies through our core business to capture additional earnings opportunities finally we seek bold collaboration or strategic investment to partner with new emerging disruptors this discipline will broaden our omni channel capabilities and accelerate our ability to serve our customers for example in september of 2018 we partnered with shift technologies a san francisco based digital retailer where we invested 54 million to become their largest shareholder this partnership benefits our organization through the following key areas of collaboration and focus a 100 consumer driven shopping experiences in home vehicle purchasing selling and servicing combining technology and data to improve retail decisioning and further activation of our nationwide network that currently reaches 80 of the consumers in our country our investor presentation includes details on additional collaboration and synergies on slide 8 we anticipate ongoing innovation and diversification in the future while also leveraging our online owned inventory which is the second largest in the country which creates a destination vehicle marketplace reflecting back on 2018 we delivered record revenues and earnings strengthened our organizational capacity with new executive talent added to our national network and invested in a virtually limitless new growth opportunity with shift together these efforts are advancing our ability to create transportation solutions wherever whenever and however consumers desire with that i d like to turn the call over to chris christopher s holzshu vice president thank you bryan our path to 15 in eps requires our stores to achieve their full profit potential to challenge our stores to maximize performance in 2019 we rely on individual annual operating plans or aop the aop combined with our dynamic reporting tools allow each store leader to diagnose trend identify opportunities and to quickly take action through these grounded and store driven performance management techniques the 250 million in incremental ebitda is attainable in our existing store base with that i d like to discuss our same store quarterly results in the quarter total sales increased 1 reflecting strong performance in new service and f i new vehicle revenue was down slightly as our average selling price increased 2 and unit sales decreased 6 gross profit per unit was 2 061 compared to 2 248 last year a decrease of 187 as inventory availability and volume incentives change stores quickly adjust their growth versus volume strategy we continue to capture market share and maintain oem sales responsibility in each of our market retail used vehicle revenues increased 10 which half was due to increased unit sales and half due to higher average selling prices our used to new ratio was 0 81 1 an increase of 13 over the prior quarter gross profit per unit was 2 158 compared to 2 025 last year an increase of 133 we continue to target 85 used vehicles per location each month and encourage our stores to capture the top of the funnel position they hold in the used car inventory in 2018 we sold 69 used units per store per month an increase of two vehicles or 3 from the prior year f i per vehicle was 1 400 compared to 1 337 last year an increase of 63 of the vehicles we sold in the quarter we arranged financing on 76 sold a service contract at 47 and sold a lifetime oil product on 22 opportunity remains especially in our unseasoned stores where f i pvrs are 400 to 500 below our seasoned store averages our total gross profit per retail unit was 3 517 an increase of 20 per unit over 2017 which continues to demonstrate the resiliency and flexibility our stores have and balancing volume and growth in the current environment our service body and parts revenue increased 6 over the prior year customer pay work which represents over a half of the revenue stream increased 8 warranty increased 4 wholesale parts increased 3 and our body shops decreased 4 service body and parts is the largest contributor to gross profit at over 35 and we anticipate continued growth in this area as more and more technologies incorporated into new vehicle as shown in our investor deck the predominant share of gross profit 78 comes from our used vehicles f i and service body and parts business lines these business lines are virtually limitless in their potential for growth in the future and allow us to confidently operate without an outsized dependence on new vehicle starts same store gross margin was 15 an increase of 30 basis points from the same period last year our pro forma sg a to gross profit was 70 9 220 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of last year primarily due to the dilutive effects of unseasoned acquisition in the past five years we have acquired over 7 billion in revenues largely at stores that maintain a ratio of sg a to gross profit well above 85 and at least 35 higher than our seasoned stores which operate in the low to mid 60 ph while these acquisitions have impacted our consolidated results we anticipate continued improvement as we achieve operational excellence and leverage in the model as bryan mentioned earlier we continue to invest in both internal and external innovation and currently estimate incurring a minimum of 10 million in operating costs in 2019 as a result as always we will evaluate the merits and successes of any investment and innovation and we ll adjust the rate of expenditures up or down as a result we delivered significant revenue and gross profit growth in the quarter while maintaining sg a well within the industry benchmarks as we integrate acquisitions work to improve growth and leverage our costs we will continue to look for leadership in our 181 locations to drive innovation efficiency and profitability while earning our customers delight and now a few comments from john john f north chief financial officer and senior vice president thanks chris as bryan mentioned earlier our store operations generate significant free cash flows that continually refuel our capital engine we strive to intelligently allocate this capital with the highest returning opportunities at december 31 2018 we had approximately 211 million in cash in available credit as well as unfinanced real estate that could provide another 248 million in 60 days to 90 days for an estimated total liquidity of 460 million at the end of the fourth quarter we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants we took advantage of the volatility in our stock price in the quarter to repurchase more shares for the year ended december 31 2018 we retired over 2 1 million shares or over 8 5 of our outstanding float at a weighted average price of 84 72 under our existing 250 million authorization approximately 234 million remains available our leveraged ebitda defined as adjusted ebitda less used for our finance risk and capital expenditures was 69 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 our net debt to ebitda is 2 3 times within our targeted range of 2 times to 2 5 times our adjusted tax rate was 24 in the quarter and just under 26 for the full year we anticipate a modest increase in tax rate of approximately 27 in 2019 primarily as a result of higher state taxes in new jersey finally in january of 2019 we called a special meeting of shareholders which resulted in the ratification of an amendment to the transition agreement we entered into with lithia s founder this amendment created benefits to our shareholders through a cap on the duration of the agreement and established a timeline for the mandatory conversion of our class b shares the amendment was ratified by 99 95 of the votes submitted and importantly excluded the class b shares which abstained from voting this concludes our prepared remarks we d now like to open the call to questions questions and answers operator thank you at this time we will be conducting a question and answer session operator instructions our first question comes from rick nelson with stephens please state your question richard nelson stephens analyst okay good morning i d like to follow up bryan on capital allocation your appetite these days for acquisition sounds like there s quite a bit for sale versus buybacks and what this 250 million ebitda opportunity i guess why wouldn t the focus be exclusively there bryan b deboer chief executive officer and president thanks rick i would start by saying that the market continues to be a buyer s market it s very active despite this the approach we approach opportunities always from a seller s market type of perspective so we can attract buyers additionally our process for capital discipline and a lot of that came from john s influence over the last number of years is pretty darn good we have metrics in terms of how to balance share buyback dividends as well as external growth and those disciplines will remain intact very soundly richard nelson stephens analyst got you so also like to ask about new vehicle sales same store units down 6 how you think that compare from a market share standpoint and what caused that type of decline christopher s holzshu vice president hi rick this is chris yes i mean we definitely maintained the market share in each one of our locations in the fourth quarter the 6 decrease that we saw in new vehicle units was heavily impacted by an opportunity we had in the northwest related to railhead distribution in our domestic stores which impacted us about 1 250 units and so i think excluding that impact we would have seen about a 3 decline in new vehicle sales which is in line with what retail saar was for the quarter richard nelson stephens analyst got you and sg a that widened a little more than we were thinking up 210 basis points and ebt actually fell in the quarter year to date despite adding on a 1 3 billion i believe in revenue via acquisition if you could discuss what happened there and what can be done from an sg a standpoint it seems like it s the acquisitions that are weighing on the sg a but i d like some clarity there christopher s holzshu vice president yes rick this is chris again you re exactly right i mean the 7 billion in revenues that we ve acquired over the last five years have not been fully integrated i mean we bought 1 4 billion in acquisition revenue last year which was acquired from a lot of really distressed assets that we have lots of opportunities to improve upon and so we re going to continue to identify ways to generate additional growth and take out the cost primarily in personnel and marketing expense that find us that balance to get us back into that kind of best in class 65 or under sg a to gross and as far as your question related to ebt that s a big focus and that was related to our floor plan interest which for the year i think was up over 50 million for the quarter it was up over 15 million and so partly a big chunk of that i think two third is related to rate and a third is related to volume so we re controlling what we can control right now which is really to focus on maximizing our turns reducing inventory where appropriate and working with our stores to make sure that they re making good investments in the inventory that they re carrying at every moment they can richard nelson stephens analyst great thanks and also like to offer my best to john north it s been awesome working with him over the years john f north chief financial officer and senior vice president thanks rick i m going to miss you christopher s holzshu vice president likewise rick operator thank you our next question comes from bret jordan with jefferies please state your question bret jordan jefferies analyst hi good morning guys bryan b deboer chief executive officer and president hi bret bret jordan jefferies analyst could we get a bit of a bit more of an update on the shift business i mean are there any kind of lead throughs are you picking up any customer base service business from people who are buying through shift or maybe some of the exchange there bryan b deboer chief executive officer and president sure bret this is bryan we are getting a little bit of uplift but it s only primarily in one store the current time in the east bay if i had to guess it s probably around 52 to a 100 ros which is minimal i would think that it doesn t impact our overall customer pay i believe in the future that it can because there is a big opportunity on digital sales that we think we can grow through our existing network we re actually we re very pleased with the first 100 days of our partnership we ve been able to collaborate on a few milestones initially that seems to be creating better results as well as a strengthened partnership with a larger equity holding by us which we think is very beneficial i think as we move forward our collaboration on data share as well as leveraging the rest of our network we still have a lot more opportunities there and we ll be sharing information with you soon on that pay attention to slide 8 as well it ll line out again the six areas of collaboration bret jordan jefferies analyst okay and then one question on the market share question that was just asked i guess when you think about it regionally if you were 3 down ex the non recurring northwest event if you think about your market share versus saar it was the east coast obviously where you ve got more acquisitions still in line with saar or are there markets that are outperforming and underperforming christopher s holzshu vice president yes this is chris again we definitely have pockets of stores that are outperforming we have pockets of stores that need significant improvement and then we have pockets of stores that are kind of maintaining the share that they ve had if i had to generally speak to the northeast i would say that upstate new york has an opportunity that s higher than what we have in the metro markets which obviously is a smaller percentage of the portfolio that we have in the northeast bret jordan jefferies analyst okay great thank you christopher s holzshu vice president thanks bret operator our next question comes from armintas sinkevicius with morgan stanley please state your question armintas sinkevicius morgan stanley analyst good morning thank you for taking the question and congratulations to john it s been a pleasure working with you in the short stint covering the company here with the omni channel experience and shift just to piggyback off the last question how are you thinking about putting your inventory on the platform you highlight in the slides that you have the second largest inventory in the country and just it would seem like that would be the easiest way to collaborate with shift and maybe would be would generate some substantial return there for the effort put in bryan b deboer chief executive officer and president this is bryan again i think if we look long term it makes a lot of sense to be able to co share inventory across both platforms initially we re really looking at building both channels more independently and support each other i think as we think about our second largest inventory that s online we really look at how do we activate it within our own network at the current time we re working on an individual regional platform that started a few months ago and we ll be able to share some results and details on that in the coming quarters we re also able to share data which is a really important part because that allows us to procure inventory in multiple ways as well as price inventory and value inventories those are the real key things initially we are starting to explore some neat ideas specifically around procurement which also can grow our inventory in ways that we really haven t in the past and again we ll share more of that in incoming calls with you armintas sinkevicius morgan stanley analyst okay and then i can appreciate that you re not providing guidance for 2019 but any puts and takes you can give us from a modeling perspective whether it s sg a or tax rate and anything that you could share would be helpful john f north chief financial officer and senior vice president yes armintas this is john appreciate the kind words by the way couple of thoughts i guess number one i think bryan said as well in the prepared remarks the goal for us is the 15 in eps and i think that looking at the share count and the relative volatility on such a small share base you need to think about that relative to the inflection for the model in 2019 we did give some color in chris section that we expect about 10 million investment in technology and we did give some color in my section around about 27 tax rate in 2019 so slightly higher than in 2018 because we ve exhausted a lot of the planning strategy around the tax law change so i think that s directionally where we see things but again longer term what we re really trying to focus everyone on is the path of significantly higher eps which is 15 plus and i think that s definitely going to be how we re trying to run the company in the future and i d leave it at that armintas sinkevicius morgan stanley analyst great thank you for taking the question john f north chief financial officer and senior vice president thank you operator our next question comes from john murphy with bank of america please state your question john murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst all right good morning guys and congratulations john it s been great working with you just a first question on the footprint and sort of the focus on acquisitions you made a comment that you were reaching about 80 of the market i m just curious what you mean by that total us market with your current existing physical footprint and if that s the case how much larger or wider you need to spread your footprint with acquisitions just trying to understand how far you think you might need to get to a 100 or if it makes sense that you can get to a 100 coverage bryan b deboer chief executive officer and president john this is bryan ideally we would like to have close to a 100 coverage because you can activate then the digital strategies but overall right now we don t touch the southeast that s about it we look at our ability to be able to deliver cars or service cars in a short period of time of eight hours to be able to touch that network okay we also believe that you don t have to be in the center of metropolitan areas that you can be in lower brick and mortar examples to be able to enter markets from a lower cost point which can be very effective in the future so i don t believe that we need a 100 obviously at 80 that s the population base it still covers almost 300 million people which is a big opportunity and can increase our 1 new car market share today and 0 5 in used cars john murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay that s very helpful so it seems like southwest might be a focus in the near term is that a fair statement bryan b deboer chief executive officer and president that is right on target i think when we think about the growth implications we typically when we go into a new region we look for a seasoned management team that we can build off that has similar growth powered by people type of value base and i think we have some pretty good candidates that hopefully at some point will be able to join us we obviously also are continuing to backfill because obviously when you have strength within a market it makes sense to be able to have both the luxury a domestic and an import franchise to be able to have full coverage john murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay that s very helpful and then a second question and doing some simple reasonably obvious math i mean as we look at the average selling price of your vehicles it s gone off and the gross on new vehicles has gone down so you re shipping back to your automaker supplier an extra 1 659 per unit obviously there s some mix in there and all that kind of stuff but i got to imagine they love you for doing that right because they re getting i mean you re giving up a little bit of gross they re getting a higher revenue and they re just doing better as you look at that i mean how long can you continue to do that and how important is that to sort of ingratiate yourself with these guys as partners to really build up the basis stores and make this acquisition strategy that much smoother easier to execute on christopher s holzshu vice president hey john this is chris i ll try and answer the first part of that question i mean obviously each one of our stores is constantly trying to manage between do i go for volume or do i go for growth and in any given month that change is based on one the availability of inventory and how strong the market is from a retail perspective and so the goal then is if we can t push as hard on the new car side obviously we have a big opportunity on used cars and which generate strong profits there and then we work on f i which has been something that has been a focus of ours obviously for the last couple of years and we continue to kind of march up to that peer level which is still significantly lower in those acquisition stores that we came through so i think that it s a balance that we fight every single day but we are partners with the oems and we re going to continue to stand by them and continue to sell their products so bryan maybe the second part is for you bryan b deboer chief executive officer and president i think chris touched a little bit on manufacturer support it s what allowed our growth strategy to be so effective because our performance is typically buying underperforming stores and then improving them which is a key part of our execution model i think what we also know for sure is that over 78 of our gross profit comes from used vehicles f i and service body and parts so the component of new vehicles is a smaller point so it does obviously impact our ability to get downstream business but remember we re also top of food chain when it comes to used cars and so many other things that our manufacturers are able to provide us whether it s certified or whether its warranty work and those things continue to be very collaborative efforts with our partners now and in the future john murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay that s helpful and then just lastly on parts and service i mean customer pay was up 8 that was very strong in the quarter margins were very high i m just curious how long you think you can keep that customer pay number in the mid to high single digit range and how much of it is a function of uio s increasing and how much of it is a function of you kind of maybe getting a little bit lower into the spectrum of potential sort of customers meaning going past five or six years or the traditional shift away from the new vehicle dealer to the independent shop i m just curious the split there and how you think about that business going forward christopher s holzshu vice president yes john this is chris again i mean you nailed the first part of that as uio continues to climb back up especially in that 10 year and newer bucket as we drop off some of those years of 2008 2009 2010 i think we see a lot of opportunity for customers returning into our stores and supporting our fixed cost business the second big thing that we believe is that the technology and features that are in the new products including the electric vehicles you got level 1 2 3 automation that s in vehicles today it s creating a lot more opportunity for the 2000 oem certified technicians that we have to be the repair center of choice for more and more consumers and we don t anticipate that that s going to go anywhere but up in the right direction john murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay and then inventory guess that your cap on a man ph basis in your stalls is very high but i mean is there a cap inaudible number that you could give us inaudible on your stalls bryan b deboer chief executive officer and president john this is bryan yes john it hovers around 50 utilization across our network john murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst lots of upside then thank you very much bryan b deboer chief executive officer and president thanks john operator our next question comes from derek glynn with consumer edge research please state your question derek glynn consumer edge research analyst thanks for taking my question john wish you the best as well in your future endeavors as you think about the incremental ebitda opportunity from seasoning of your store base and then looking across your various operating segments is there any low hanging fruit or what significant opportunity do you see in 2019 to help you march further toward achieving that goal bryan b deboer chief executive officer and president derek this is bryan i think our number one opportunity is inventory i mean we are in about two thirds of our stores are in rural markets where our inventories have to be somewhat of size to be able to provide up choices for our consumers but despite that we believe that there s inventory sharing that can go across by like brands and we re working on some real neat tools on digital to be able to share that to help drive our dollars down on inventory i would say this also opportunities in cost savings come through improving sales volumes so most of our stores are acutely focused on how to capture market share and i think digital experiences and our ability to do things for customers wherever whenever and however they choose is a really crucial part to our continued growth in that realm which allows us the flexibility to be able to massage expenses and keep profits growing to capture that 250 million in potential derek glynn consumer edge research analyst okay and then as it relates to some of the larger acquisitions you completed recently such as prestige day downtown la how are trends tracking relative to your internal expectations and can you share any details around progress made on sg a to gross is there any other key metrics for those acquisitions christopher s holzshu vice president yes derek this is chris they re all unique and each store is actually unique in each one of those platforms but i think generally speaking the more seasoned of those acquisitions are doing better than the less seasoned acquisitions we talk about the season stores that are running sg a to gross in that 65 range versus our unseasoned stores which as a group are running somewhere north of 75 i mean that 10 points of difference in sg a would be 44 million in the quarter alone if they were equal so we re continuing to work on each store each general manager has opportunities in each business line top line and then we continue to focus on driving out costs so yes that s what i d say on that derek glynn consumer edge research analyst okay thank you christopher s holzshu vice president thanks derek operator thank you our next question comes from rajat gupta with jpmorgan please state your question rajat gupta jpmorgan analyst hi thanks for taking my question and i wanted to echo everyone else s comments best of luck to john in the future thanks for all the help recently just have one question i think the 250 million opportunity you highlighted that for a few quarters now i mean how much of that is already in the run rate now or is that 250 million still all incremental and more than that ph like how much do we expect probably close to 2019 and given that some of that flow through can we still expect sg a to gross profit to be down in 2019 versus 18 given you re already investing 10 million in technology i mean just trying to get a sense of what the thought is there for sg a to gross profit in the near to medium term bryan b deboer chief executive officer and president rajat let me definitively say that it s all incremental the 250 million isn t in our how we think about things it s all additional business to us and it is through driving gross profit as well as top line revenue to be able to capture that if we look at the breakdown of where it typically comes from it comes from volume increases that trickle down into the used car business into f i to reach the 1 400 to 1 500 a unit that we currently recognize it then takes a number of years to build your units and operations which ultimately drives your service and parts business and if you do a good job at service and parts business then they continue to buy again and that engine becomes a momentum builder to be able to capture that potential so as we said in the prepared remarks it s typically about a five year maturity to reach a seasoned state and currently about 20 of our stores achieve that maybe 30 depending on those opportunities rajat gupta jpmorgan analyst understood john f north chief financial officer and senior vice president hey rajat rajat this is john i ll just jump in on the sg a question really quickly you did mention the 10 million i mean to put it in perspective i think we did close to a 1 3 billion in sg a expense in 2018 so clearly 10 million is not immaterial from an earnings perspective i mean it s roughly about 0 30 but when you think about it in the grand scheme of the sg a opportunity we re talking about and if we can get anywhere near the leverage that chris is speaking to in the mid 60s it s going to be very meaningful but as we said from the beginning it s all a function of driving gross up it s not necessarily about cutting costs you can t cut your way to a profit that s the one thing that we know rajat gupta jpmorgan analyst fair enough thanks for clarifying that just a question on shift you talked about you announced expansion of the collaboration recently is there any more investment we can expect in the jv and not in terms of stake but just in terms of sg a type expenses in order to leverage the partnership the way you want to and is there any earnings benefit we could start seeing from 2019 onwards or is that still too early for the partnership that ll be helpful thanks bryan b deboer chief executive officer and president thanks rajat this is bryan any growth plans with shift are pretty low cost venture because you re leveraging your existing network i think if we look at other types of investments that s not really what we re focused on if you remember we focused on our internal business first then we focused on adjacencies and then lastly we focused on shift type of opportunities and i think as you build out your model if you think about that the shift opportunities will come every few years as will large platform acquisitions other than that our focus is to drive our existing stores to achieve potential and that s what our team has been experienced at and why growth powered by people is such an important statement for our mission as a company rajat gupta jpmorgan analyst got it okay thanks bryan b deboer chief executive officer and president thanks operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from david whiston with morningstar please state your question david whiston morningstar analyst thanks good morning correct me if i m wrong but in the past i think in your slide deck you had mentioned some interest in possibly expanding internationally to both canada and the uk and with the brexit turmoil are you still interested in the uk no matter how that ends up playing out bryan b deboer chief executive officer and president david this is bryan i think we would enter cautiously we are still looking internationally but again those are long term strategies that i think in our acquisition model we re very good about diagnosing and setting up standards before we jump so we ve spent now approximately three years in canada and probably two years looking at uk and a few other markets around the world but ultimately when there s opportunities domestically and the returns have been still high it s a lot easier to be able to achieve that and build out that 100 footprint in our existing store base david whiston morningstar analyst okay and any impact from higher rates driving the shift to used up or new or is it more things like more off lease vehicles in the market bryan b deboer chief executive officer and president we re not seeing any major impact on that david david whiston morningstar analyst okay and last question chris you talked about being especially on the newer stores a lot of sg a to cuts and i guess my question is with you guys acquiring over 1 billion a year now is there ever a point where you might be at a point where you re growing too fast christopher s holzshu vice president yes david this is chris i think when you look at our entrepreneurial focus model where the general manager is really responsible for making those decisions in the stores we re managing 180 different locations with a team of senior group leaders that support each one of those general managers and i think based on the model that we have and the people that we have right now in the field we have a lot of capacity to bring on additional stores and turn them around as quick as possible david whiston morningstar analyst okay and john you ll be missed thanks a lot christopher s holzshu vice president he will john f north chief financial officer and senior vice president thanks david operator thank you there are no further questions at this time i ll turn the conference back to management for closing remarks thank you

us productivity growth has been slower for the past 8 years vs the kind of productivity rates we used to see in the past this factor has been significant for why overall us economic growth has been slow at least until very recently as pro growth policies have been in effect peak globalization especially when looked at from the viewpoint of imports as a percent of our gdp which peaked in 2008 could very well tell us why productivity has stalled it s imperative that investors understand the relationship between productivity and economic growth so i want to begin by explaining this detail how we get economic growth economic growth is derived from two factors total hours worked the output per hour that is worked to get the total hours worked i go to the civilian employment level this tells me how many people in the us are employed source u s bureau of labor statistics civilian employment level retrieved from fred federal reserve bank of st louis february 12 2019 the next factor is the total number of hours which i can get by multiplying the average weekly hours worked by the total number of people employed what this chart above gives us is the total amount of hours worked per week in the us the second factor for economic growth is the output per hour what i can do is multiply the hours worked by the output per hour to get an aggregate output of economic activity in the us the annual growth rate of total hours worked x the output per hour is about the same as the annual rate of real gdp another way of saying it is the rate of real gdp is equal to the sum of the growth in hours worked and the growth in output per hour worked even if you have zero growth in aggregate hours worked as long as you have growth in the output per hour you can still have a positive rate of gdp peak globalization an unsung benefit of globalization for the us was the importation of deflation productivity after all is the reduction in the cost to produce or have something done productivity is itself a deflationary force the three factors that go into the cost of anything are 1 time labor 2 capital money 3 energy btu and cost getting right to the point instead of american companies economizing within the organization of figuring how to reduce the cost to produce the product or service so to stay competitive globalization with new trading partners like mexico and china meant rather than compete we just let them do it hence the boom in imports while our exports could not keep pace we traded dollars instead the above chart shows the percent of imports and exports to our gdp the u s ran trade surpluses in the 1950s and 1960s by the 1970s trade was about even and then by the late 1970s we began to run trade deficits what this chart shows more than anything is that imports as a percent of gdp peaked in the 3rd quarter of 2008 at 18 15 exactly 10 years later it is now down to 15 5 of gdp peak imports and there goes productivity here is the chart that really struck me as to why us productivity has been dead in the water this chart goes from 1988 to the present it was in the early 1990s when nafta went into effect creating a giant sucking sound of jobs leaving the us for mexico i worked for a company that made printed circuit boards we made 100 of the boards that went into chrysler cars as well as many other car manufactures this was from 1999 2004 it was in the 1990s when my us company built a plant in mexico so it could be right next to the us auto companies that moved production just south of the border so our boards would be made where is the us up to the final steps of production like inspection electrical testing packing and shipping this production move allowed us first and foremost to reduce the cost to the customer but also keep us competitive with our competitors prices we had to do it fast forward to 2001 when china entered the world trade organization a country where they could build factories stock them up with state of the art equipment bought from taiwan and japan and germany then build dormitories to house thousands of workers who would come from the countryside to both live and work at the factory for 50 a month it was the death of us large scale circuit board manufacturing for the us china could produce the same boards at a fraction of the cost of course these costs would be passed on to the consumers too here is a chart of the cpi of new cars the price of new cars starting falling in the late 1990s that s probably about the time when the production to mexico was ramped up then in the 2000s car parts began to get produced in china en masse like the printed circuit boards we used to make this reduction in the cost of new vehicles was not a result of in house gains in productivity it was a result of outsourcing parts to be made by extremely cheap labor the productivity in the us came from reduced input costs from importing parts and materials as well as services that simply made the end cost to produce the product or services cheaper thus boosting our own in house productivity this peaked in 2008 along with a peak in imports as a percent of gdp therein lies a very good reason for why our productivity overall has slowed what s to come how i see it we re still getting gains in productivity led light bulbs uber uber apps for getting a ride fast and cheap faster internet and smartphones have all been good for improving our daily productivity what concerns me is that today we still enjoy a very strong dollar relative to nearly all our trading partners and that is another factor that keeps imports cheap we also still have large trade deficits that need to be remedied a future with a weaker dollar and a more balanced trade we risk the inverse of what we had in the past which was the great importation of deflation to a great in house inflation with all this said if overall trade declines and we begin to rebuild our manufacturing base we are going to be met with higher input costs that will prove inflationary we could have a period of declining productivity due to higher input costs as i explained hours worked and output per hour are what drive real economic growth real incomes would decline standards of living would fall it would be under this scenario gold gld would be the place to be

financial and operating results for this past quarter and the full year 2018 and update you on our growth plans and outlook for 2019 elizabeth will then follow with a more detailed review of the numbers before we open it up for your questions we re very pleased to continue our solid performance in the fourth quarter of 2018 and it sets us up well to drive continued growth across all of our business segments in 2019 and beyond for the quarter revenue grew 9 to 478 million and adjusted eps increased 23 to 0 90 in our full service center segment we added 15 centers including new client centers for colgate palmolive and cambridge university as well as additional centers for penn state and the mayo clinic we also completed two high quality tuck in acquisitions in the quarter one in the u k and one in the netherlands we also continue to expand our back up and education advisory client base with recent new client launches for hilton worldwide samsung ocean spray and kettering health in addition children s hospital health system and hp represent cross sells of existing clients to our back up and educational advisory services these recent additions are great examples of the more than 250 of our employer clients who purchased more than one of our services we continue to be very excited about these cross selling successes and the significant untapped opportunity with the rest of our client base as we focus on selling the full suite of services to new and existing clients we officially unveiled our modernized logo and collection of brands that tie each of our services directly to the bright horizons trade name and mark we believe that closer affiliation of each of the service names will allow clients and end users to feel greater connection with the overall bright horizons brand i encourage you to visit our newly launched website to experience one of the ways we are bringing this to life tracking our solid top line growth we also continue to deliver strong and consistent operating results across the business in the fourth quarter adjusted operating income expanded 110 basis points as we leverage enrollment gains and our newer and ramping full service centers strong utilization of our back up and educational advising services and operating efficiencies from technology over the last several quarters we ve talked about the investments we ve been making in targeted marketing programs and technology to speed and improve the end user experience we continue to be really pleased with the progress of these initiatives exemplified by improved conversion from registration to back up use and expanded capability to confirm care reservations instantly these initiatives once fully rolled out should continue to drive growth and operating leverage over time let me turn now to another of our growth initiatives our lease consortium center strategy as a reminder lease consortium centers have always been a part of the bright horizons growth plan in recent years we focus this strategy in select urban settings where we see a concentrated population of our target demographic limited supply of high quality child care and strong opportunities to meet the needs of our client partners over the last six years we ve opened 85 of these centers and now have more of these centers at mature operating levels than those still ramping their enrollment as a result in 2018 the margin generated by this group of centers as a whole has become a modest contributor to margin expansion and we expect to continue to modestly expand that contribution as the most recently opened centers ramp to their mature levels we are pleased with the progress of this strategy and therefore we ll continue to invest in this area as we see significant value creation opportunity in these centers over time as many of you have heard us talk about on prior calls our organic growth strategy is focused on cultivating new clients and expanding our existing client relationships through cross sells and additional take up of current services after another solid year in both of these categories i m really optimistic about the sales and growth momentum across all aspects of our business in 2019 and beyond the sales pipeline in each of our services remain strong with interest across industries with both new and existing clients we also continue to execute on our acquisition strategy i mentioned earlier that we had completed two deals in the fourth quarter and overall for 2018 we re really pleased to complete transactions which added a total of 36 centers across all three of our primary geographies we continue to cultivate a solid pipeline of prospects including a good mix of networks and single center opportunities both here in the u s and abroad and we expect these acquisitions to continue to be a key element of our growth plan in the years ahead before i wrap up i want to comment briefly on the thought leadership study that we published last month for five years we ve been researching the struggle working parent face in both the u s and the u k through our modern family index the harsh reality is that when we focus the lens on working mothers it s clear that workplaces still have a long way to go to meet the needs of women as they grow their families and their careers at the same time our data shows that mothers and fathers in the u s agree in overwhelming numbers that women are penalized in their careers for starting families while men are not in the u k the study revealed that the average mother waits two years longer for a promotion than the average father on an equally important note our modern family index reveals that mothers bring key leadership skills that are critical to today s businesses what we ve learned from the studies is that the need is as great as ever for employers to provide family friendly services it s not only important for families but it s critical for the health of employers as well we are very proud to be the partner of choice for so many leading employers looking to meet the needs of the modern workforce so in summary we believe that we are well positioned to continue the positive momentum and operating agility we have demonstrated over years for 2019 we anticipate continued strong performance with revenue growth in the range of 8 to 10 and operating leverage to drive adjusted earnings per share in the range of 3 57 to 3 63 with that elizabeth can review the numbers in more detail and i ll be back with you during q a elizabeth boland chief financial officer thank you stephen once again recapping the headlines for the fourth quarter of 2018 overall revenue was up 9 or 38 million in the quarter the 8 growth in full service center revenue around 30 million was driven by rate increases enrollment gains and contributions from new centers including about 2 from acquisitions fx impact was a slight headwind to full service growth for the quarter approximately 80 basis points new client launches and expanded utilization by existing clients helped drive 9 revenue growth in backup and 19 growth in ed advisory services in q4 gross profit increased 12 5 million to 121 million or 25 2 of revenue and adjusted operating income increased to 63 7 million or 13 3 of revenue as stephen mentioned up 110 basis points from q4 of 2017 in our full service segment adjusted operating income expanded 50 basis points to 9 2 on gains from enrollment growth in our mature and ramping centers from contributions from our new and acquired centers and from tuition increases both of the backup and ed advisory segments reported operating income margins over 30 in the quarter on strong utilization levels continued scale in these operations and improving efficiency of service delivery interest expense of 12 million in q4 of 2018 was up slightly over 2017 as incremental revolver borrowings to finance acquisitions and share repurchases was offset by lower average interest rates our current borrowing cost approximates 4 with 500 million of our term loans fixed with an interest rate swap we ended the quarter at 3 25 turns of net debt to ebitda our structural tax rate for 2018 on adjusted net income came in at 21 lower than our previous estimate due primarily to a reduction in the effective tax rate on our foreign earnings with our improved operating performance and positive working capital movements we also continue to generate strong cash flow for 2018 our operating cash flow of 295 million was up 47 million over the prior year in terms of deploying that cash flow in our overall capital allocation strategy our first priorities continue to be investments in the growth of the business this is illustrated by the 100 million plus we spent in 2018 on new centers and acquisitions and the 50 million plus we reinvested in our existing operations and support functions share repurchases are our third priority after new business investments and acquisitions in 2018 we acquired a total of 1 2 million shares under our share repurchase program lastly at the end of 2018 we operated 1 082 centers with the capacities to serve 120 000 children and across all of our service lines we now partner with more than 1 150 clients adding to the guidance headlines that stephen touched on earlier we do continue to project top line growth for 2019 in the range of 8 to 10 including low double digit revenue gains in our back up division and top line growth in our ed advisory services in the range of 15 to 20 in our full service segment we re projecting top line growth in the range of 7 to 8 including the effects of approximately 1 projected foreign exchange headwind on lower pound and euro rates on the operating side for 2019 we expect to continue to add approximately 1 to 2 to the top line from enrollment in our ramping and mature full service centers and to realize average price increases in the range of 3 5 to 4 across the p l center network while maintaining a 1 spread between price and our cost center cost increases we re expecting to add approximately 50 new centers including organic openings and acquisitions consistent with 2018 we also anticipate that we will close 20 to 25 centers as we maintain the discipline that we ve established over the last several years top line growth and increasing efficiency in our service delivery contribute to improved operating performance and margin improvement in 2019 in the range of 50 to 100 basis points compared to 2018 on some other key metrics for the full year 2019 we estimate amortization expense of 33 million to 34 million depreciation in the range of 75 million to 78 million and stock compensation of 18 million to 19 million based on our outstanding borrowings and estimates of interest rates for the rest of the year we project that interest expense will approximate 48 million to 50 million on the tax front we are projecting that the structural tax rate will increase from 21 this past year to approximately 24 in 2019 this increase primarily reflects the diminishing impact of stock option exercises on our reported tax expense lastly weighted average shares are projected to approximate 59 million for the year we estimate that we will generate approximately 300 million to 320 million of cash flow from operations and to have 50 million of maintenance capital which would yield 250 million to 275 million of free cash flow for us to invest in the ongoing growth of the business we expect to invest 45 million to 50 million of that in new center capital for centers opening this year and in early 2020 the combination of all these factors lead to our projection of adjusted net income of 209 million to 214 million in 2019 and adjusted eps growth in the low double digits to a range of 3 57 to 3 63 a share looking specifically to q1 we ve seen a decline in foreign exchange rate since q1 of 2018 that we expected to impact growth rates specifically we are projecting approximately 7 top line growth including a foreign exchange headwind of approximately 1 5 on the bottom line we re projecting adjusted net income in the range of 45 million to 46 5 million and adjusted eps in the range of 0 77 to 0 79 a share and so hector with that we are ready to go to q a questions and answers operator thank you at this time we ll be conducting a question and answer session operator instructions our first question comes from the line of andrew steinerman with jpmorgan please proceed with your question michael cho jp morgan analyst hi good evening this is michael cho for andrew my first question is just around the margin this past quarter around in backup it was quite an improvement year over year i mean and i know you called out scale and investments but i was wondering if you can provide a little bit more color behind the margin profile and backup elizabeth boland chief financial officer yes so we have as mentioned on prior calls mike we ve got some variability that can occur in both the backup and ed advising business based on levels of utilization and so there is a fairly strong utilization time period in the fourth quarter with holidays and so that s the main driver is down to the good levels of use that we had and some of our clients are per use clients and so that that use is incremental to the performance and as a result we are seeing that on the topline and then on the bottom line i do think that we re it s too to soon to have seen all of the efficiencies of some of the investments that we re making on that technology and user experience but we are beginning to gain from some of the automation of the reservation process and the matching of service we re seeing some efficiency that is coming into the cost structure so at the margin it all contributes michael cho jp morgan analyst understood if i could just ask a quick follow up on the tech investments i mean and i know stephen had a bit of color around investments in your prepared remarks but i understand kind of just looking for matching and efficiencies but can you give a little bit more insight into kind of what has actually been the benefits and what s actually expected over the near and medium term from these past tech investments thanks stephen kramer president chief executive officer and director sure so the tech investments as you ll know are really focused on driving additional use as well as user experience and so on the driving additional use side i think we ve shown some really good progress as it relates to first engaging more users within a particular employers client base so increasing the numbers of individuals that are registered to use and then ultimately putting them on personalized journeys that allow us to communicate to them when we perceive they may have a need and allowing them to then react to that communication and so from a marketing perspective i think we feel really good about the progress that we re making in that regard both from creating more registrations as well as creating more reservations on the user experience side certainly we see great user experience enhancements across all the lines of service but probably the one that is most significant is in the backup area and very specifically around the ability for an end user to instantly book care and so that is really creating connectivity between the end user and the supply that we have and so it makes it a frictionless process for them to put in a reservation and ultimately get an instant care confirmation and so what that does for the user is it eliminates any of the lag time that there is around whether or not and who is going to serve that care and then secondly from an efficiency standpoint it eliminates some of the cost associated with what had previously been an interaction with the contact center so again i think that from both the marketing perspective as well as from a user experience perspective we re seeing good strides and obviously the impact is both at the top line as well as from a cost structure perspective michael cho jp morgan analyst great thank you operator our next question comes from the line of manav patnaik with barclays please proceed with your question ryan leonard barclays analyst hi this is ryan leonard filling in for manav just a question on the cost in the quarter i guess adjusted ebitda came in a little bit light relative to our expectations were there any costs associated with either the rebranding that you mentioned or maybe some of these college programs you re rolling out for employees elizabeth boland chief financial officer sorry ryan i wasn t able to quite hear you you said with respect to the cost in the quarter ryan leonard barclays analyst yes i think costs were a little bit higher than we had expected and i was just wondering if there s any onetime things to call out whether it d be some of the rebranding or some of the education you re providing for associates that that had any impact that we should be aware of elizabeth boland chief financial officer well we ve had really good i d say on the education program what we re really pleased about is we ve had very good a takeup on the what we re calling the horizons teacher s degree program and have had a very good level of interest and so there is a modest cost associated with that i think it s absorbable in our overall structure so i m not calling that out as an unusual cost we have had a really positive response to it likewise the branding we re excited about what it s going to bring in and it involved some level of cost but not something that s unusual or outsize so i don t think we have anything to call out particularly on the cost front no ryan leonard barclays analyst okay fair enough and then just a quick one if i could on the buyback how should we think of the pace of that or i guess what s assumed in guidance or how do you think of it kind of strategically on your end elizabeth boland chief financial officer yes i mean our view is we have a very predictable cash flow generation business of course and so as i mentioned in the prepared remarks we are expecting to have free cash flow well north of 250 million and so to the extent that we can identify growth opportunities be they acquisitions we do tuck in acquisitions as a matter of course those are part of our standard plan if you will so that is part of our guidance but an outsize acquisition should that come along that would be an opportunity for us to deploy more of that cash we have 100 million or so that we re investing in new centers that we re developing and in maintenance capital but that still leaves a level of cash flow that is predictable from year to year and replenishing year to year that we would be looking to continue to be active with a repurchase program so it the plan considers regular borrowing but we re not really signaling exactly what that is we have a 300 million program that s authorized we ve been regular buyers in the open market and now that bain exited their position earlier in 2018 those larger blocks added to the volume a bit but we would continue to be active stephen kramer president chief executive officer and director and ryan just doubling back to your original assertion around cost i would just observe that we feel really good about the 110 basis point improvement so not really clear what you re referencing on the cost side but again we re really pleased with the performance both from revenue and cost perspective that yielded the margin that we had in the fourth quarter ryan leonard barclays analyst understood thanks operator our next question comes from the line of gary bisbee with bank of america please proceed with your question gary bisbee bank of america analyst hi good afternoon it didn t feel the same without dave bragging on the patriots but as a giants fan i have to say didn t mind not hearing it elizabeth boland chief financial officer we re just trying to cut everybody a break i know it s sort of gary bisbee bank of america analyst so as i sit back and think about the pretty terrific growth you ve driven in the six years since your second ipo i guess i ve been trying to spend some time thinking about how do we think about multiyear growth from here is it would it be fair to project the broad outlines of the 2019 guidance as sustainable growth targets over the next few years and by that i guess i m thinking the eight to 10 revenue the 50 to 100 bps of margin expansion and double digit earnings growth is that reasonable or is given the scale of the company is it just is it getting more difficult i don t know if there s any if you want to give official updates or anything you d point out that we might think about over the next few years thanks stephen kramer president chief executive officer and director sure so i ll start and i m sure elizabeth will play color as well but the way i would start to answer that question is really around the opportunity that we see and we continue to see really strong opportunity in all of the lines of service that we deliver on so in terms of an expectation on the top line i think it s very fair to assume that we will continue to look at an 8 to 10 growth rate based on the fact that when we look at the white space within our existing client base as well as within those who are today not clients we see terrific opportunities for building out additional centers attracting more back up clients and ed advisory clients and then the use within each one of those three categories we see is continuing to have a very positive trend line associated with it and so maybe elizabeth you want to cover up on the margin side elizabeth boland chief financial officer yeah i mean i do think that the 50 to 100 basis points gary we would see as we continue to bed in a little bit of a tailwind with our lease model strategy adding call it 20 25 basis points a year for the next couple of years still that s really more of a mature series or cohorts and then seeing that operating margin ability to expand that in the range more like 25 to 50 or 75 basis points so maybe a call it two three year horizon on the 50 to 100 and then tapering a bit but the inherent structural elements of the model do offer modest opportunities for leverage when we are both vigilant about cost management labor intensive business and then making smart investments that allow us to enable technology to support the service delivery in our back up and ed advising in a more effective way and in a more user conscious way those things were both costless and be a better experience for the end user so i think there s a lot to execute to get that done but i think that our view is we do have some inherent business model elements that allow for ongoing leverage and so as you say a conversion of top line growth at a faster pace so in the double digit range certainly probably lower double digits but that is sustainable gary bisbee bank of america analyst okay and one of the keys obviously to margins historically has been the ability to price in excess of labor cost inflation that you re paying out i ve always thought it s dangerous to think long term 3 to 5 every year for as many years as you ve done it is there anything does that become more difficult to get at some point or do you feel like where you are relative to people s ability to pay and relative to the market continues to remain in a compelling level such that you could continue to pass on this price over several more years elizabeth boland chief financial officer yeah i think that the it s important to keep it at the structure where there s a bit of gaap and we target 1 gaap at lease room for some variability but to have a gaap whether the wage rates are going up at 3 or 2 and flexing according to that not getting ahead of ourselves on how much we will price but i think that we ve got a long track record of having the ability to price in a way that we have and to be transparent with parents and to have a service that they are able to afford because of other both what they re earning and or the employer support to it so it s something we pay a lot of attention to again don t want to sound either complacent about it or that it doesn t get a lot of focus but we are geographic location by location making pricing determinations and adjusting according to that market and the demand profile so i think that there s a long winded way of saying we think we can sustain price increases and to absorb the kinds of cost increases that we ve seen over the last couple of years with wage rates both modestly ticking up a bit faster than they had been and the movement behind minimum wages in certain locations where we ve always had reasonable visibility there and stayed ahead of that pricing gary bisbee bank of america analyst and then just one last one if i could on the lease consortium good to see them contributing or the drag no longer there from margins does the contributing in 2018 does that mean that the gross margins for that business are now above the corporate average or does that just mean that the drag is less in some way and i guess i m trying to think of yeah go ahead elizabeth boland chief financial officer it s more that the drag if the drag is less i mean as a cohort they re still in the high single digits to low double digits and that s the range of where they would be as a cohort so they re still not contributing at the overall rate of the full service segment but they are not absorbing more losses so it s becoming a positive and so that s why there is a little bit more runway there gary for there to be an extra 20 25 basis points from the lease consortium through the next couple of years as they continue to i think you may have been the person who asked us a couple of years ago but what level how many years of this would you have and do you got a mature cohort but we re six years in another three years four years while 10 years of these centers only two to three years that are not mature that s when we would really consider to be at a sort of a just rolling level and so i m going on too long i mean with answers but that s the gist of it we see a little bit of continued opportunity there gary bisbee bank of america analyst great thank you very much elizabeth boland chief financial officer yeah operator our next question comes from the line of jeff meuler with baird please proceed with your question jeff meuler baird analyst yeah thank you good afternoon the my family care acquisition does that have a sizable backup component to it and can you just refresh us on our backup business in the u k and i guess the netherlands if it s applicable stephen kramer president chief executive officer and director yeah good afternoon jeff thank you for the question so we did acquire recently the my family care in the u k and their focus and their business really is in the backup segment and so if we take a step back and why that was an important acquisition for us we believe we re in the really early innings of the backup opportunity in the u k and our backup opportunity outside the u s today is the u k and they were very focused on the u k as well so as one of our main competitors i think from an opportunity perspective it s a really nice pickup for us a few things that we think make it particularly attractive one is it came along with obviously economics again both our business in the u k as well as their business is relatively small so i would characterize it no different from a tuck in acquisition that we might do on the center side that s sort of the scale that we re talking about on the other hand it came along with some important client partnerships it came along with some solid technology and i think lastly but quite importantly it came along with some really high quality people that have been dedicated to the backup space similar to us for a number of years now and so we see the combination of our backup business and my family care s backup business as a really good platform to continue to accelerate the momentum in that u k market for backup care in the netherlands we don t have a backup care business in fact there is no market in today s economy there for backup so this is really about u k opportunity jeff meuler baird analyst thank you for that and then i hear you on the branding and branding all of the services around bright horizons any other initiatives change in sales force change in compensation to get after the big opportunity of cross selling to take it well beyond the i guess 250 clients stephen kramer president chief executive officer and director yes so i think we re really staying the course there we made some sort of fundamental structural changes over the last 18 months and believe now we re well positioned to go after that opportunity as i ve shared on previous calls things that we have implemented are one that the sales folks are really partnering with our account management team to go after our existing client base we created a small enterprise team that is focused on some of the more complex large opportunities so again i think we ve done some really good things around the team itself and then as you rightly mentioned i think we have now aligned our incentives so that our teams are really focused on not only bringing new clients into the family but also making sure that we are really going after the opportunity that exists within our existing client base jeff meuler baird analyst okay thank you and then just one last one so what is the outlook intermediate long term now on the backup care margins and i guess i m just it seemed like the messaging was hey we have really good margins in that business it s very economic to us it s a growth business the growth is still there but it sounds like maybe you re starting to see some of the pay offs on the investments and structurally they could improve the margins of the business so is there going to be reinvestment and should we still think of backup care as a fuller margin story or are you seeing an inflection following those investments and should it would you expect it to be a business with margin expansion over a multiyear horizon elizabeth boland chief financial officer well i think our view on back up is as it continues to mature of course there s a number of factors that go into the overall the mix of where we are providing care the mix of clients who are capitated and sort of a of buying a basket of uses versus pre use and so there s some elements of that that will evolve over time we think that the margin for this full year so in q4 it was over 30 for the full year of 2018 it was in the high 20 s and we would expect that being able to stay in that range and maybe tick up modestly toward the 30 range is possible with the efficiencies that come with these we will continue to invest but the efficiencies should come through but i do think that at a 30 level and with the clients that we re working with that will be a reasonable target for us to sustain in that level rather than a much leverage beyond that jeff jeff meuler baird analyst got it thank you stephen kramer president chief executive officer and director thanks jeff operator operator instructions our next question comes from the line of with george tong with goldman sachs please proceed with your question brian zimmerman goldman sachs analyst you have brian on for george today you mentioned that you plan to organically add 50 new centers in 2019 can you talk about how the pace of new openings compared with earlier periods taking into account competitive dynamics industry penetration and customer spending intentions elizabeth boland chief financial officer yes i mean it s a fairly consistent expectation the mix of those centers we would expect to be in the 12 to 15 would be lease consortium models that we are citing and another 15 to 20 would be client centers so what we re seeing is continued interest from the industries that we ve seen good penetration in the healthcare pharmaceuticals the tech sector has been a bit more active the last couple of years and that we would continue to see colleges universities as new clients and expanding their footprint so from a client spending standpoint this tends to be a fairly long decision cadence we haven t really seen a different pace just a steady pace from clients on the spending side hence they re relatively similar level of new centers that we d expect to open brian zimmerman goldman sachs analyst great thanks and then for my last question can you discuss how enrollment and pricing trends have been performing in light of tightening labor market and later cycle economic environment elizabeth boland chief financial officer yes so we as we had anticipated for 2018 we saw about 1 enrollment gain in our mature centers and then we of course have ramping centers that contribute as well but pretty solid enrollment in the mature base with our labor rates as i mentioned before the labor has been seen a little bit firmer wage increase we do wage increases every year it s not a new thing but we re seeing wages climbing more like to 2 5 to 3 on average and in some cases where there are markets that are having seattle for example had put in a minimum wage law several years ago that has been introduced over the course of many years in that environment over the last couple of years we ve seen wages climbing a bit faster we pay above minimum wage but it still has an effect on all kinds of companies like ours that are working with workforce that s competing against some of the minimum wage jobs so in that way we re seeing again staying ahead of the labor rates but probably 2 5 to 3 on average brian zimmerman goldman sachs analyst great thank you operator our next question comes from the line of hamzah mazari with macquarie please proceed with your question mario cortellucci macquarie analyst this is mario cortellacci filling in for hamzah i know you guys already touched on the work that you re kind of doing in order to cross sell and increase the number of subscription you have from clients but i guess you guys are around like that 21 22 range right now and just wanted to see if you think that 2019 we could see that accelerate or even over the longer term how big do you think that number could be realistically stephen kramer president chief executive officer and director yes so the way we look at it is we obviously look at our existing client base and have very strong relationships with those clients we have an understanding as it relates to what services the particular clients would benefit from so we really do a bottoms up analysis to figure out client by client what services their them as an employer and their employees would benefit from and then obviously we try to introduce those services to them in an appropriate way so i think the hardest part about seeing the percentage move up is that we continue to see that many new clients to the bright horizons family come into our organization investing in a single service and so we continue to grow the number of single service clients while at the same time we continue to increase the number of cross sells that ultimately add additional services to existing clients so what we re really focused on is less about the percentage although that will tick up naturally over time and really focused on the number of clients who are investing in multiple services and we ve seen really nice progress as it relates to the numbers of our clients that are investing in multiple services mario cortellucci macquarie analyst got it okay and just one more could you maybe talk about your m a pipeline internationally whether markets like france or australia or even certain asian countries are attractive and whether there are platforms or platform deals you could do in those regions stephen kramer president chief executive officer and director absolutely it s a great question and the quick answer is yes so we continue to monitor where we think we could add value by operating in a particular country when we think about countries that are most appropriate for our expansion plans we re really looking for those countries that have some source of third party financial support for child care and so that can come in the form of government as it is in the place like the netherlands or it can come in the form of employers like we have here in the united states and so there are many countries throughout europe as well as in asia and as you mentioned australia where one or both of those two possibilities exist so again we try not to speculate which country will necessarily be next on the other hand we continue to look for ways to keep good relationships with platform as you call them opportunities throughout the world and there are a number of those in each of the countries that we are evaluating and so we continue to keep great relationships and at the point where they re ready to sell and or it makes sense for us to go to a particular place we ll be on the ready and i think as we demonstrated from the experience in the netherlands we have the ability to go in with a platform type acquisition and then grow both organically and through additional acquisition to create quite a presence in a market mario cortellucci macquarie analyst great thank you so much stephen kramer president chief executive officer and director thank you elizabeth boland chief financial officer welcome operator our next question comes from the line of jeff silber with bmo capital markets please proceed with your question jeff silber bmo capital markets analyst thanks so much wanted to focus actually on your first quarter guidance i know it s the first time you ve given it and it seems like consensus was a little bit ahead of your guidance or maybe we got out over our skis a little bit you called out fx pressure i m just wondering if there s anything specifically going on did you have any impact from the government shutdown et cetera elizabeth boland chief financial officer we really didn t have much effect we do run centers for a number of government agencies jeff and had i think one or two centers that had just one center had to close others had funding elsewhere that they were able to continue to stay open during the shutdown and serve families so not an impact from the government shutdown in the first quarter i think it s mostly a comp versus i mean fx is certainly a factor and a comp against what had been a first quarter that had not only high foreign exchange in relation to this year but it was higher in relation to the year before that otherwise we feel really good about the overall components the same full service growth components would play in the first quarter and we ve just had solid backup new client launches and we feel good about the kickoff to the year there too so nothing else to call out in terms of unexpected cost that were heavy jeff silber bmo capital markets analyst okay that s helpful and as my follow up i know we talked a little bit about wage inflation before i m just curious just focusing on your center staff considering what s going on in the labor market are you seeing higher than normal turnover or having difficulty finding people stephen kramer president chief executive officer and director yeah so one of the key features of bright horizons as an organization is we really are an employer of choice and we spend a tremendous amount of time and have over our 30 year history investing in our culture and investing in our people and so we haven t actually experienced any difference in the turnover rates i think that once someone determines that this is the field that they want to be in we like to think that they re excited to be a practitioner within our organization and i think our turnover rates suggest that and to put a fine point on it our turnover rates at bright horizons are about half of the industry average and that s been consistent and in fact in a market like the one we re in it s actually a little bit less than half because again i think we have real stability in our workforce and i think others are struggling in the way that you described jeff silber bmo capital markets analyst okay great that s helpful thanks so much stephen kramer president chief executive officer and director thank you elizabeth boland chief financial officer thanks jeff stephen kramer president chief executive officer and director wonderful well thank you again for joining us on the call we appreciate the questions and the insights so wishing you all a good night and looking forward to seeing you out on the road

deboer president and ceo bryan b deboer chief executive officer and president thank you megan good morning and thank you for joining us today earlier today we reported the highest adjusted fourth quarter earnings in company history 2 57 per share a 20 increase over the fourth quarter of 2017 full year adjusted eps was 9 98 a 19 increase over last year our earnings improvement was driven by strong top line gross profit growth both up 17 full year revenues were 11 8 billion and we delivered double digit revenue increases in all business lines we remain focused on our core strategy of purchasing strong assets that have yet to realize their full potential to achieve operational excellence throughout our network these efforts will drive the realization of the 250 million in incremental ebitda potential within our existing store base this creates a clear line of sight to 15 in eps and provide the additional capital necessary to accelerate consolidation within our highly fragmented industry in just a few minutes chris will be providing more details on 2018 and how our teams are delivering operational excellence through their 2019 annual operating plan as mentioned in our press release john is resigning on march 1st i would like to thank john for a fun and productive 17 years together at lithia we will miss him and wish him great success in his future endeavors in addition i want to congratulate our 36 circle of champion winners as our highest performing stores in 2018 thank you we also invited two additional general managers to our lithia partners group recognition as an lpg member is a highly coveted position at lithia and represents the pinnacle of our mission growth powered by people our people have positioned us to drive both traditional m a and innovation in the years to come in the past five years we have achieved both revenue and earnings compound annual growth rates of over 20 our history of running a hyper growth company that is accelerating earnings is a unique differentiator for lithia in addition to this growth we continue to maintain sector leading operational metrics the automotive retail business remains unconsolidated in 2018 nationally we achieved over 1 of the new car market share and approximately 1 5 of used car market share despite being one of the largest vehicle retailers in the country looking forward we see that technology and innovation combined with the nationwide network can provide the advantages necessary to gain meaningful market share in the future in 2018 we acquired 1 4 billion annualized revenue and made investments in innovation to access consumers through new and alternative channel we continue to monitor over 2 600 acquisition targets and other strategic opportunities that meet our strict return on equity hurdles our value based investment strategy has an 80 success rate in achieving 15 to 20 after tax returns on seasoned stores meaning within five years of acquisition this is an exciting time for both retail and transportation and we are well positioned to lead the way as both continue to modernize our history of successful growth and operational excellence generates over 300 million in free cash flow annually that enables us to expand and diversify we pursue innovation and diversification strategy in the following order first we drive improvement in our existing business next we consider vertical and horizontal adjacencies through our core business to capture additional earnings opportunities finally we seek bold collaboration or strategic investment to partner with new emerging disruptors this discipline will broaden our omni channel capabilities and accelerate our ability to serve our customers for example in september of 2018 we partnered with shift technologies a san francisco based digital retailer where we invested 54 million to become their largest shareholder this partnership benefits our organization through the following key areas of collaboration and focus a 100 consumer driven shopping experiences in home vehicle purchasing selling and servicing combining technology and data to improve retail decisioning and further activation of our nationwide network that currently reaches 80 of the consumers in our country our investor presentation includes details on additional collaboration and synergies on slide 8 we anticipate ongoing innovation and diversification in the future while also leveraging our online owned inventory which is the second largest in the country which creates a destination vehicle marketplace reflecting back on 2018 we delivered record revenues and earnings strengthened our organizational capacity with new executive talent added to our national network and invested in a virtually limitless new growth opportunity with shift together these efforts are advancing our ability to create transportation solutions wherever whenever and however consumers desire with that i d like to turn the call over to chris christopher s holzshu vice president thank you bryan our path to 15 in eps requires our stores to achieve their full profit potential to challenge our stores to maximize performance in 2019 we rely on individual annual operating plans or aop the aop combined with our dynamic reporting tools allow each store leader to diagnose trend identify opportunities and to quickly take action through these grounded and store driven performance management techniques the 250 million in incremental ebitda is attainable in our existing store base with that i d like to discuss our same store quarterly results in the quarter total sales increased 1 reflecting strong performance in new service and f i new vehicle revenue was down slightly as our average selling price increased 2 and unit sales decreased 6 gross profit per unit was 2 061 compared to 2 248 last year a decrease of 187 as inventory availability and volume incentives change stores quickly adjust their growth versus volume strategy we continue to capture market share and maintain oem sales responsibility in each of our market retail used vehicle revenues increased 10 which half was due to increased unit sales and half due to higher average selling prices our used to new ratio was 0 81 1 an increase of 13 over the prior quarter gross profit per unit was 2 158 compared to 2 025 last year an increase of 133 we continue to target 85 used vehicles per location each month and encourage our stores to capture the top of the funnel position they hold in the used car inventory in 2018 we sold 69 used units per store per month an increase of two vehicles or 3 from the prior year f i per vehicle was 1 400 compared to 1 337 last year an increase of 63 of the vehicles we sold in the quarter we arranged financing on 76 sold a service contract at 47 and sold a lifetime oil product on 22 opportunity remains especially in our unseasoned stores where f i pvrs are 400 to 500 below our seasoned store averages our total gross profit per retail unit was 3 517 an increase of 20 per unit over 2017 which continues to demonstrate the resiliency and flexibility our stores have and balancing volume and growth in the current environment our service body and parts revenue increased 6 over the prior year customer pay work which represents over a half of the revenue stream increased 8 warranty increased 4 wholesale parts increased 3 and our body shops decreased 4 service body and parts is the largest contributor to gross profit at over 35 and we anticipate continued growth in this area as more and more technologies incorporated into new vehicle as shown in our investor deck the predominant share of gross profit 78 comes from our used vehicles f i and service body and parts business lines these business lines are virtually limitless in their potential for growth in the future and allow us to confidently operate without an outsized dependence on new vehicle starts same store gross margin was 15 an increase of 30 basis points from the same period last year our pro forma sg a to gross profit was 70 9 220 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of last year primarily due to the dilutive effects of unseasoned acquisition in the past five years we have acquired over 7 billion in revenues largely at stores that maintain a ratio of sg a to gross profit well above 85 and at least 35 higher than our seasoned stores which operate in the low to mid 60 ph while these acquisitions have impacted our consolidated results we anticipate continued improvement as we achieve operational excellence and leverage in the model as bryan mentioned earlier we continue to invest in both internal and external innovation and currently estimate incurring a minimum of 10 million in operating costs in 2019 as a result as always we will evaluate the merits and successes of any investment and innovation and we ll adjust the rate of expenditures up or down as a result we delivered significant revenue and gross profit growth in the quarter while maintaining sg a well within the industry benchmarks as we integrate acquisitions work to improve growth and leverage our costs we will continue to look for leadership in our 181 locations to drive innovation efficiency and profitability while earning our customers delight and now a few comments from john john f north chief financial officer and senior vice president thanks chris as bryan mentioned earlier our store operations generate significant free cash flows that continually refuel our capital engine we strive to intelligently allocate this capital with the highest returning opportunities at december 31 2018 we had approximately 211 million in cash in available credit as well as unfinanced real estate that could provide another 248 million in 60 days to 90 days for an estimated total liquidity of 460 million at the end of the fourth quarter we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants we took advantage of the volatility in our stock price in the quarter to repurchase more shares for the year ended december 31 2018 we retired over 2 1 million shares or over 8 5 of our outstanding float at a weighted average price of 84 72 under our existing 250 million authorization approximately 234 million remains available our leveraged ebitda defined as adjusted ebitda less used for our finance risk and capital expenditures was 69 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 our net debt to ebitda is 2 3 times within our targeted range of 2 times to 2 5 times our adjusted tax rate was 24 in the quarter and just under 26 for the full year we anticipate a modest increase in tax rate of approximately 27 in 2019 primarily as a result of higher state taxes in new jersey finally in january of 2019 we called a special meeting of shareholders which resulted in the ratification of an amendment to the transition agreement we entered into with lithia s founder this amendment created benefits to our shareholders through a cap on the duration of the agreement and established a timeline for the mandatory conversion of our class b shares the amendment was ratified by 99 95 of the votes submitted and importantly excluded the class b shares which abstained from voting this concludes our prepared remarks we d now like to open the call to questions questions and answers operator thank you at this time we will be conducting a question and answer session operator instructions our first question comes from rick nelson with stephens please state your question richard nelson stephens analyst okay good morning i d like to follow up bryan on capital allocation your appetite these days for acquisition sounds like there s quite a bit for sale versus buybacks and what this 250 million ebitda opportunity i guess why wouldn t the focus be exclusively there bryan b deboer chief executive officer and president thanks rick i would start by saying that the market continues to be a buyer s market it s very active despite this the approach we approach opportunities always from a seller s market type of perspective so we can attract buyers additionally our process for capital discipline and a lot of that came from john s influence over the last number of years is pretty darn good we have metrics in terms of how to balance share buyback dividends as well as external growth and those disciplines will remain intact very soundly richard nelson stephens analyst got you so also like to ask about new vehicle sales same store units down 6 how you think that compare from a market share standpoint and what caused that type of decline christopher s holzshu vice president hi rick this is chris yes i mean we definitely maintained the market share in each one of our locations in the fourth quarter the 6 decrease that we saw in new vehicle units was heavily impacted by an opportunity we had in the northwest related to railhead distribution in our domestic stores which impacted us about 1 250 units and so i think excluding that impact we would have seen about a 3 decline in new vehicle sales which is in line with what retail saar was for the quarter richard nelson stephens analyst got you and sg a that widened a little more than we were thinking up 210 basis points and ebt actually fell in the quarter year to date despite adding on a 1 3 billion i believe in revenue via acquisition if you could discuss what happened there and what can be done from an sg a standpoint it seems like it s the acquisitions that are weighing on the sg a but i d like some clarity there christopher s holzshu vice president yes rick this is chris again you re exactly right i mean the 7 billion in revenues that we ve acquired over the last five years have not been fully integrated i mean we bought 1 4 billion in acquisition revenue last year which was acquired from a lot of really distressed assets that we have lots of opportunities to improve upon and so we re going to continue to identify ways to generate additional growth and take out the cost primarily in personnel and marketing expense that find us that balance to get us back into that kind of best in class 65 or under sg a to gross and as far as your question related to ebt that s a big focus and that was related to our floor plan interest which for the year i think was up over 50 million for the quarter it was up over 15 million and so partly a big chunk of that i think two third is related to rate and a third is related to volume so we re controlling what we can control right now which is really to focus on maximizing our turns reducing inventory where appropriate and working with our stores to make sure that they re making good investments in the inventory that they re carrying at every moment they can richard nelson stephens analyst great thanks and also like to offer my best to john north it s been awesome working with him over the years john f north chief financial officer and senior vice president thanks rick i m going to miss you christopher s holzshu vice president likewise rick operator thank you our next question comes from bret jordan with jefferies please state your question bret jordan jefferies analyst hi good morning guys bryan b deboer chief executive officer and president hi bret bret jordan jefferies analyst could we get a bit of a bit more of an update on the shift business i mean are there any kind of lead throughs are you picking up any customer base service business from people who are buying through shift or maybe some of the exchange there bryan b deboer chief executive officer and president sure bret this is bryan we are getting a little bit of uplift but it s only primarily in one store the current time in the east bay if i had to guess it s probably around 52 to a 100 ros which is minimal i would think that it doesn t impact our overall customer pay i believe in the future that it can because there is a big opportunity on digital sales that we think we can grow through our existing network we re actually we re very pleased with the first 100 days of our partnership we ve been able to collaborate on a few milestones initially that seems to be creating better results as well as a strengthened partnership with a larger equity holding by us which we think is very beneficial i think as we move forward our collaboration on data share as well as leveraging the rest of our network we still have a lot more opportunities there and we ll be sharing information with you soon on that pay attention to slide 8 as well it ll line out again the six areas of collaboration bret jordan jefferies analyst okay and then one question on the market share question that was just asked i guess when you think about it regionally if you were 3 down ex the non recurring northwest event if you think about your market share versus saar it was the east coast obviously where you ve got more acquisitions still in line with saar or are there markets that are outperforming and underperforming christopher s holzshu vice president yes this is chris again we definitely have pockets of stores that are outperforming we have pockets of stores that need significant improvement and then we have pockets of stores that are kind of maintaining the share that they ve had if i had to generally speak to the northeast i would say that upstate new york has an opportunity that s higher than what we have in the metro markets which obviously is a smaller percentage of the portfolio that we have in the northeast bret jordan jefferies analyst okay great thank you christopher s holzshu vice president thanks bret operator our next question comes from armintas sinkevicius with morgan stanley please state your question armintas sinkevicius morgan stanley analyst good morning thank you for taking the question and congratulations to john it s been a pleasure working with you in the short stint covering the company here with the omni channel experience and shift just to piggyback off the last question how are you thinking about putting your inventory on the platform you highlight in the slides that you have the second largest inventory in the country and just it would seem like that would be the easiest way to collaborate with shift and maybe would be would generate some substantial return there for the effort put in bryan b deboer chief executive officer and president this is bryan again i think if we look long term it makes a lot of sense to be able to co share inventory across both platforms initially we re really looking at building both channels more independently and support each other i think as we think about our second largest inventory that s online we really look at how do we activate it within our own network at the current time we re working on an individual regional platform that started a few months ago and we ll be able to share some results and details on that in the coming quarters we re also able to share data which is a really important part because that allows us to procure inventory in multiple ways as well as price inventory and value inventories those are the real key things initially we are starting to explore some neat ideas specifically around procurement which also can grow our inventory in ways that we really haven t in the past and again we ll share more of that in incoming calls with you armintas sinkevicius morgan stanley analyst okay and then i can appreciate that you re not providing guidance for 2019 but any puts and takes you can give us from a modeling perspective whether it s sg a or tax rate and anything that you could share would be helpful john f north chief financial officer and senior vice president yes armintas this is john appreciate the kind words by the way couple of thoughts i guess number one i think bryan said as well in the prepared remarks the goal for us is the 15 in eps and i think that looking at the share count and the relative volatility on such a small share base you need to think about that relative to the inflection for the model in 2019 we did give some color in chris section that we expect about 10 million investment in technology and we did give some color in my section around about 27 tax rate in 2019 so slightly higher than in 2018 because we ve exhausted a lot of the planning strategy around the tax law change so i think that s directionally where we see things but again longer term what we re really trying to focus everyone on is the path of significantly higher eps which is 15 plus and i think that s definitely going to be how we re trying to run the company in the future and i d leave it at that armintas sinkevicius morgan stanley analyst great thank you for taking the question john f north chief financial officer and senior vice president thank you operator our next question comes from john murphy with bank of america please state your question john murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst all right good morning guys and congratulations john it s been great working with you just a first question on the footprint and sort of the focus on acquisitions you made a comment that you were reaching about 80 of the market i m just curious what you mean by that total us market with your current existing physical footprint and if that s the case how much larger or wider you need to spread your footprint with acquisitions just trying to understand how far you think you might need to get to a 100 or if it makes sense that you can get to a 100 coverage bryan b deboer chief executive officer and president john this is bryan ideally we would like to have close to a 100 coverage because you can activate then the digital strategies but overall right now we don t touch the southeast that s about it we look at our ability to be able to deliver cars or service cars in a short period of time of eight hours to be able to touch that network okay we also believe that you don t have to be in the center of metropolitan areas that you can be in lower brick and mortar examples to be able to enter markets from a lower cost point which can be very effective in the future so i don t believe that we need a 100 obviously at 80 that s the population base it still covers almost 300 million people which is a big opportunity and can increase our 1 new car market share today and 0 5 in used cars john murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay that s very helpful so it seems like southwest might be a focus in the near term is that a fair statement bryan b deboer chief executive officer and president that is right on target i think when we think about the growth implications we typically when we go into a new region we look for a seasoned management team that we can build off that has similar growth powered by people type of value base and i think we have some pretty good candidates that hopefully at some point will be able to join us we obviously also are continuing to backfill because obviously when you have strength within a market it makes sense to be able to have both the luxury a domestic and an import franchise to be able to have full coverage john murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay that s very helpful and then a second question and doing some simple reasonably obvious math i mean as we look at the average selling price of your vehicles it s gone off and the gross on new vehicles has gone down so you re shipping back to your automaker supplier an extra 1 659 per unit obviously there s some mix in there and all that kind of stuff but i got to imagine they love you for doing that right because they re getting i mean you re giving up a little bit of gross they re getting a higher revenue and they re just doing better as you look at that i mean how long can you continue to do that and how important is that to sort of ingratiate yourself with these guys as partners to really build up the basis stores and make this acquisition strategy that much smoother easier to execute on christopher s holzshu vice president hey john this is chris i ll try and answer the first part of that question i mean obviously each one of our stores is constantly trying to manage between do i go for volume or do i go for growth and in any given month that change is based on one the availability of inventory and how strong the market is from a retail perspective and so the goal then is if we can t push as hard on the new car side obviously we have a big opportunity on used cars and which generate strong profits there and then we work on f i which has been something that has been a focus of ours obviously for the last couple of years and we continue to kind of march up to that peer level which is still significantly lower in those acquisition stores that we came through so i think that it s a balance that we fight every single day but we are partners with the oems and we re going to continue to stand by them and continue to sell their products so bryan maybe the second part is for you bryan b deboer chief executive officer and president i think chris touched a little bit on manufacturer support it s what allowed our growth strategy to be so effective because our performance is typically buying underperforming stores and then improving them which is a key part of our execution model i think what we also know for sure is that over 78 of our gross profit comes from used vehicles f i and service body and parts so the component of new vehicles is a smaller point so it does obviously impact our ability to get downstream business but remember we re also top of food chain when it comes to used cars and so many other things that our manufacturers are able to provide us whether it s certified or whether its warranty work and those things continue to be very collaborative efforts with our partners now and in the future john murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay that s helpful and then just lastly on parts and service i mean customer pay was up 8 that was very strong in the quarter margins were very high i m just curious how long you think you can keep that customer pay number in the mid to high single digit range and how much of it is a function of uio s increasing and how much of it is a function of you kind of maybe getting a little bit lower into the spectrum of potential sort of customers meaning going past five or six years or the traditional shift away from the new vehicle dealer to the independent shop i m just curious the split there and how you think about that business going forward christopher s holzshu vice president yes john this is chris again i mean you nailed the first part of that as uio continues to climb back up especially in that 10 year and newer bucket as we drop off some of those years of 2008 2009 2010 i think we see a lot of opportunity for customers returning into our stores and supporting our fixed cost business the second big thing that we believe is that the technology and features that are in the new products including the electric vehicles you got level 1 2 3 automation that s in vehicles today it s creating a lot more opportunity for the 2000 oem certified technicians that we have to be the repair center of choice for more and more consumers and we don t anticipate that that s going to go anywhere but up in the right direction john murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay and then inventory guess that your cap on a man ph basis in your stalls is very high but i mean is there a cap inaudible number that you could give us inaudible on your stalls bryan b deboer chief executive officer and president john this is bryan yes john it hovers around 50 utilization across our network john murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst lots of upside then thank you very much bryan b deboer chief executive officer and president thanks john operator our next question comes from derek glynn with consumer edge research please state your question derek glynn consumer edge research analyst thanks for taking my question john wish you the best as well in your future endeavors as you think about the incremental ebitda opportunity from seasoning of your store base and then looking across your various operating segments is there any low hanging fruit or what significant opportunity do you see in 2019 to help you march further toward achieving that goal bryan b deboer chief executive officer and president derek this is bryan i think our number one opportunity is inventory i mean we are in about two thirds of our stores are in rural markets where our inventories have to be somewhat of size to be able to provide up choices for our consumers but despite that we believe that there s inventory sharing that can go across by like brands and we re working on some real neat tools on digital to be able to share that to help drive our dollars down on inventory i would say this also opportunities in cost savings come through improving sales volumes so most of our stores are acutely focused on how to capture market share and i think digital experiences and our ability to do things for customers wherever whenever and however they choose is a really crucial part to our continued growth in that realm which allows us the flexibility to be able to massage expenses and keep profits growing to capture that 250 million in potential derek glynn consumer edge research analyst okay and then as it relates to some of the larger acquisitions you completed recently such as prestige day downtown la how are trends tracking relative to your internal expectations and can you share any details around progress made on sg a to gross is there any other key metrics for those acquisitions christopher s holzshu vice president yes derek this is chris they re all unique and each store is actually unique in each one of those platforms but i think generally speaking the more seasoned of those acquisitions are doing better than the less seasoned acquisitions we talk about the season stores that are running sg a to gross in that 65 range versus our unseasoned stores which as a group are running somewhere north of 75 i mean that 10 points of difference in sg a would be 44 million in the quarter alone if they were equal so we re continuing to work on each store each general manager has opportunities in each business line top line and then we continue to focus on driving out costs so yes that s what i d say on that derek glynn consumer edge research analyst okay thank you christopher s holzshu vice president thanks derek operator thank you our next question comes from rajat gupta with jpmorgan please state your question rajat gupta jpmorgan analyst hi thanks for taking my question and i wanted to echo everyone else s comments best of luck to john in the future thanks for all the help recently just have one question i think the 250 million opportunity you highlighted that for a few quarters now i mean how much of that is already in the run rate now or is that 250 million still all incremental and more than that ph like how much do we expect probably close to 2019 and given that some of that flow through can we still expect sg a to gross profit to be down in 2019 versus 18 given you re already investing 10 million in technology i mean just trying to get a sense of what the thought is there for sg a to gross profit in the near to medium term bryan b deboer chief executive officer and president rajat let me definitively say that it s all incremental the 250 million isn t in our how we think about things it s all additional business to us and it is through driving gross profit as well as top line revenue to be able to capture that if we look at the breakdown of where it typically comes from it comes from volume increases that trickle down into the used car business into f i to reach the 1 400 to 1 500 a unit that we currently recognize it then takes a number of years to build your units and operations which ultimately drives your service and parts business and if you do a good job at service and parts business then they continue to buy again and that engine becomes a momentum builder to be able to capture that potential so as we said in the prepared remarks it s typically about a five year maturity to reach a seasoned state and currently about 20 of our stores achieve that maybe 30 depending on those opportunities rajat gupta jpmorgan analyst understood john f north chief financial officer and senior vice president hey rajat rajat this is john i ll just jump in on the sg a question really quickly you did mention the 10 million i mean to put it in perspective i think we did close to a 1 3 billion in sg a expense in 2018 so clearly 10 million is not immaterial from an earnings perspective i mean it s roughly about 0 30 but when you think about it in the grand scheme of the sg a opportunity we re talking about and if we can get anywhere near the leverage that chris is speaking to in the mid 60s it s going to be very meaningful but as we said from the beginning it s all a function of driving gross up it s not necessarily about cutting costs you can t cut your way to a profit that s the one thing that we know rajat gupta jpmorgan analyst fair enough thanks for clarifying that just a question on shift you talked about you announced expansion of the collaboration recently is there any more investment we can expect in the jv and not in terms of stake but just in terms of sg a type expenses in order to leverage the partnership the way you want to and is there any earnings benefit we could start seeing from 2019 onwards or is that still too early for the partnership that ll be helpful thanks bryan b deboer chief executive officer and president thanks rajat this is bryan any growth plans with shift are pretty low cost venture because you re leveraging your existing network i think if we look at other types of investments that s not really what we re focused on if you remember we focused on our internal business first then we focused on adjacencies and then lastly we focused on shift type of opportunities and i think as you build out your model if you think about that the shift opportunities will come every few years as will large platform acquisitions other than that our focus is to drive our existing stores to achieve potential and that s what our team has been experienced at and why growth powered by people is such an important statement for our mission as a company rajat gupta jpmorgan analyst got it okay thanks bryan b deboer chief executive officer and president thanks operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from david whiston with morningstar please state your question david whiston morningstar analyst thanks good morning correct me if i m wrong but in the past i think in your slide deck you had mentioned some interest in possibly expanding internationally to both canada and the uk and with the brexit turmoil are you still interested in the uk no matter how that ends up playing out bryan b deboer chief executive officer and president david this is bryan i think we would enter cautiously we are still looking internationally but again those are long term strategies that i think in our acquisition model we re very good about diagnosing and setting up standards before we jump so we ve spent now approximately three years in canada and probably two years looking at uk and a few other markets around the world but ultimately when there s opportunities domestically and the returns have been still high it s a lot easier to be able to achieve that and build out that 100 footprint in our existing store base david whiston morningstar analyst okay and any impact from higher rates driving the shift to used up or new or is it more things like more off lease vehicles in the market bryan b deboer chief executive officer and president we re not seeing any major impact on that david david whiston morningstar analyst okay and last question chris you talked about being especially on the newer stores a lot of sg a to cuts and i guess my question is with you guys acquiring over 1 billion a year now is there ever a point where you might be at a point where you re growing too fast christopher s holzshu vice president yes david this is chris i think when you look at our entrepreneurial focus model where the general manager is really responsible for making those decisions in the stores we re managing 180 different locations with a team of senior group leaders that support each one of those general managers and i think based on the model that we have and the people that we have right now in the field we have a lot of capacity to bring on additional stores and turn them around as quick as possible david whiston morningstar analyst okay and john you ll be missed thanks a lot christopher s holzshu vice president he will john f north chief financial officer and senior vice president thanks david operator thank you there are no further questions at this time i ll turn the conference back to management for closing remarks thank you

scottsdale ariz feb 13 2019 prnewswire taylor morrison home corporation nyse tmhc today reported fiscal year 2018 total revenue of over 4 2 billion and diluted earnings per share of 1 83 or 2 65 when adjusted to exclude the impact from unusual items full year 2018 highlights home closings were 8 760 a 9 increase over the prior year total revenue was 4 2 billion an almost 9 increase over the prior

gross margin inclusive of capitalized interest was 18 2 net income was 210 million and net income adjusted to exclude unusual items was 306 million we continue to believe that the current new home sales environment has best been described as a break in momentum as the industry finds its new normal the conditions the industry experienced during the back half of 2018 in regard to interest rates affordability and the resulting press coverage led many potential buyers that had been in the market to take a wait and see approach with that said there continues to be plenty of macro data points that give us confidence in the near term outlook unemployment and job creation are still at historically very healthy levels incomes continue to grow many of the major markets in the u s continue to have limited housing supply and the industry continues to be under built based on historical averages said chairman and ceo sheryl palmer we delivered on all of our strategic priorities we laid out at the beginning of 2018 including pursuing smart strategic growth producing enhanced operational excellence and differentiating our customer experience we grew in a smart and strategic way through the acquisition of av homes we improved our operations through crm enhancements procurement initiatives and centralizing key functions where it made sense like accounting and purchasing and our goal of delivering a more differentiated customer experience was supported through crowdsourcing campaigns and devoting more focus time and resources to customer research each of these priorities carries with it a common theme of putting taylor morrison in a position for future success which was most recently recognized by lifestory research naming us america s most trusted home builder for the fourth year in a row palmer also added it s been about four months since we closed the av acquisition and i m happy to report that we are on track with our integration plan and in some areas well ahead of schedule based on our work to date we can comfortably take the run rate synergy estimate up to 40 million 10 million more than originally communicated for 2018 net income on a gaap basis was 210 million and diluted earnings per share was 1 83 home closings gross margin inclusive of capitalized interest was 17 1 percent said dave cone executive vice president and chief financial officer when the unusual items that we faced in 2018 are excluded net income would be 306 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share would be 2 65 further adjusted home closings gross margin inclusive of capitalized interest would be 18 2 percent the company recognized 96 million of unusual items in net income consisting of expenses from the av acquisition costs associated with the canadian unwind and corporate reorganization land charges and an increase in reserves related to remediating a warranty issue reconciliations of our non gaap financial measures are included with this release income taxes were 63 million for the year representing an effective tax rate of 23 percent our net homebuilding debt to capitalization ratio was 41 9 percent this is an increase from where we had been the last few quarters due to the acquisition of av but we anticipate working this back to well under 40 as we go through 2019 added cone homebuilding inventories were 4 0 billion at the end of the quarter including 6 014 homes in inventory compared to 4 351 homes in inventory at the end of the prior year homes in inventory at the end of the quarter consisted of 3 213 sold units 486 model homes and 2

adjusted income before income taxes iii net homebuilding debt to total capitalization ratio iv home closings gross margin and adjusted home closings gross margin and v adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share to net income available to the company adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure that measures performance by adjusting net income to exclude interest amortized to cost of sales and interest income net income taxes depreciation and amortization non cash compensation expense and loss on extinguishment of debt if any adjusted income before income taxes is a non gaap financial measure that reflects our income before income taxes excluding the impact of significant and unusual transactions and transaction and corporate reorganization expenses related to our acquisition of av homes and our internal corporate reorganization net homebuilding debt to capitalization is a non gaap financial measure we calculate by dividing i total debt less unamortized debt issuance costs and mortgage warehouse borrowings net of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents by ii total capitalization the sum of net homebuilding debt and total stockholders equity adjusted home closings gross margin is a non gaap financial measure calculated based on gaap home closings gross margin which is inclusive of capitalized interest excluding impairments if any warranty charges if any and purchase accounting adjustments adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share are non gaap financial measures that reflect the net income available to the company excluding the impact of significant and unusual transactions and transaction and corporate reorganization expenses and the tax impact due to such items the tax reform impact due to the revaluation of deferred assets and liabilities and due to the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings and resulting adjustments to non controlling interest management uses these non gaap financial measures to evaluate our performance on a consolidated basis as well as the performance of our regions and to set targets for performance based compensation we also use the ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capitalization as an indicator of overall leverage and to evaluate our performance against other companies in the homebuilding industry in the future we may include additional adjustments in the above described non gaap financial measures to the extent we deem them appropriate and useful to management and investors we believe adjusted ebitda provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it allows investors to evaluate our performance without the effects of various items we do not believe are characteristic of our ongoing operations or performance and because it assists both investors and management in analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of our business adjusted ebitda also provides an indicator of general economic performance that is not affected by fluctuations in interest rates or effective tax rates levels of depreciation or amortization or unusual items because we use the ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capitalization to evaluate our performance against other companies in the homebuilding industry we believe this measure is also relevant and useful to investors for that reason we believe that adjusted home closings gross margin is useful to investors because it allows investors to evaluate the performance of our homebuilding operations without the varying effects of impairment charges warranty charges and purchase accounting adjustments we believe that adjusted income before income taxes adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share are useful for investors in order to allow them to evaluate our operations without the effects of various items we do not believe are characteristic of our ongoing operations or performance and also because each assists both investors and management in analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of our business these non gaap financial measures should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for the comparable u s gaap financial measures of our operating performance or liquidity although other companies in the homebuilding industry may report similar information their definitions may differ we urge investors to understand the methods used by other companies to calculate similarly titled non gaap financial measures before comparing their measures to ours adjusted income before income taxes

numbers before we open it up for your questions we re very pleased to continue our solid performance in the fourth quarter of 2018 and it sets us up well to drive continued growth across all of our business segments in 2019 and beyond for the quarter revenue grew 9 to 478 million and adjusted eps increased 23 to 0 90 in our full service center segment we added 15 centers including new client centers for colgate palmolive and cambridge university as well as additional centers for penn state and the mayo clinic we also completed two high quality tuck in acquisitions in the quarter one in the u k and one in the netherlands we also continue to expand our back up and education advisory client base with recent new client launches for hilton worldwide samsung ocean spray and kettering health in addition children s hospital health system and hp represent cross sells of existing clients to our back up and educational advisory services these recent additions are great examples of the more than 250 of our employer clients who purchased more than one of our services we continue to be very excited about these cross selling successes and the significant untapped opportunity with the rest of our client base as we focus on selling the full suite of services to new and existing clients we officially unveiled our modernized logo and collection of brands that tie each of our services directly to the bright horizons trade name and mark we believe that closer affiliation of each of the service names will allow clients and end users to feel greater connection with the overall bright horizons brand i encourage you to visit our newly launched website to experience one of the ways we are bringing this to life tracking our solid top line growth we also continue to deliver strong and consistent operating results across the business in the fourth quarter adjusted operating income expanded 110 basis points as we leverage enrollment gains and our newer and ramping full service centers strong utilization of our back up and educational advising services and operating efficiencies from technology over the last several quarters we ve talked about the investments we ve been making in targeted marketing programs and technology to speed and improve the end user experience we continue to be really pleased with the progress of these initiatives exemplified by improved conversion from registration to back up use and expanded capability to confirm care reservations instantly these initiatives once fully rolled out should continue to drive growth and operating leverage over time let me turn now to another of our growth initiatives our lease consortium center strategy as a reminder lease consortium centers have always been a part of the bright horizons growth plan in recent years we focus this strategy in select urban settings where we see a concentrated population of our target demographic limited supply of high quality child care and strong opportunities to meet the needs of our client partners over the last six years we ve opened 85 of these centers and now have more of these centers at mature operating levels than those still ramping their enrollment as a result in 2018 the margin generated by this group of centers as a whole has become a modest contributor to margin expansion and we expect to continue to modestly expand that contribution as the most recently opened centers ramp to their mature levels we are pleased with the progress of this strategy and therefore we ll continue to invest in this area as we see significant value creation opportunity in these centers over time as many of you have heard us talk about on prior calls our organic growth strategy is focused on cultivating new clients and expanding our existing client relationships through cross sells and additional take up of current services after another solid year in both of these categories i m really optimistic about the sales and growth momentum across all aspects of our business in 2019 and beyond the sales pipeline in each of our services remain strong with interest across industries with both new and existing clients we also continue to execute on our acquisition strategy i mentioned earlier that we had completed two deals in the fourth quarter and overall for 2018 we re really pleased to complete transactions which added a total of 36 centers across all three of our primary geographies we continue to cultivate a solid pipeline of prospects including a good mix of networks and single center opportunities both here in the u s and abroad and we expect these acquisitions to continue to be a key element of our growth plan in the years ahead before i wrap up i want to comment briefly on the thought leadership study that we published last month for five years we ve been researching the struggle working parent face in both the u s and the u k through our modern family index the harsh reality is that when we focus the lens on working mothers it s clear that workplaces still have a long way to go to meet the needs of women as they grow their families and their careers at the same time our data shows that mothers and fathers in the u s agree in overwhelming numbers that women are penalized in their careers for starting families while men are not in the u k the study revealed that the average mother waits two years longer for a promotion than the average father on an equally important note our modern family index reveals that mothers bring key leadership skills that are critical to today s businesses what we ve learned from the studies is that the need is as great as ever for employers to provide family friendly services it s not only important for families but it s critical for the health of employers as well we are very proud to be the partner of choice for so many leading employers looking to meet the needs of the modern workforce so in summary we believe that we are well positioned to continue the positive momentum and operating agility we have demonstrated over years for 2019 we anticipate continued strong performance with revenue growth in the range of 8 to 10 and operating leverage to drive adjusted earnings per share in the range of 3 57 to 3 63 with that elizabeth can review the numbers in more detail and i ll be back with you during q a elizabeth boland chief financial officer thank you stephen once again recapping the headlines for the fourth quarter of 2018 overall revenue was up 9 or 38 million in the quarter the 8 growth in full service center revenue around 30 million was driven by rate increases enrollment gains and contributions from new centers including about 2 from acquisitions fx impact was a slight headwind to full service growth for the quarter approximately 80 basis points new client launches and expanded utilization by existing clients helped drive 9 revenue growth in backup and 19 growth in ed advisory services in q4 gross profit increased 12 5 million to 121 million or 25 2 of revenue and adjusted operating income increased to 63 7 million or 13 3 of revenue as stephen mentioned up 110 basis points from q4 of 2017 in our full service segment adjusted operating income expanded 50 basis points to 9 2 on gains from enrollment growth in our mature and ramping centers from contributions from our new and acquired centers and from tuition increases both of the backup and ed advisory segments reported operating income margins over 30 in the quarter on strong utilization levels continued scale in these operations and improving efficiency of service delivery interest expense of 12 million in q4 of 2018 was up slightly over 2017 as incremental revolver borrowings to finance acquisitions and share repurchases was offset by lower average interest rates our current borrowing cost approximates 4 with 500 million of our term loans fixed with an interest rate swap we ended the quarter at 3 25 turns of net debt to ebitda our structural tax rate for 2018 on adjusted net income came in at 21 lower than our previous estimate due primarily to a reduction in the effective tax rate on our foreign earnings with our improved operating performance and positive working capital movements we also continue to generate strong cash flow for 2018 our operating cash flow of 295 million was up 47 million over the prior year in terms of deploying that cash flow in our overall capital allocation strategy our first priorities continue to be investments in the growth of the business this is illustrated by the 100 million plus we spent in 2018 on new centers and acquisitions and the 50 million plus we reinvested in our existing operations and support functions share repurchases are our third priority after new business investments and acquisitions in 2018 we acquired a total of 1 2 million shares under our share repurchase program lastly at the end of 2018 we operated 1 082 centers with the capacities to serve 120 000 children and across all of our service lines we now partner with more than 1 150 clients adding to the guidance headlines that stephen touched on earlier we do continue to project top line growth for 2019 in the range of 8 to 10 including low double digit revenue gains in our back up division and top line growth in our ed advisory services in the range of 15 to 20 in our full service segment we re projecting top line growth in the range of 7 to 8 including the effects of approximately 1 projected foreign exchange headwind on lower pound and euro rates on the operating side for 2019 we expect to continue to add approximately 1 to 2 to the top line from enrollment in our ramping and mature full service centers and to realize average price increases in the range of 3 5 to 4 across the p l center network while maintaining a 1 spread between price and our cost center cost increases we re expecting to add approximately 50 new centers including organic openings and acquisitions consistent with 2018 we also anticipate that we will close 20 to 25 centers as we maintain the discipline that we ve established over the last several years top line growth and increasing efficiency in our service delivery contribute to improved operating performance and margin improvement in 2019 in the range of 50 to 100 basis points compared to 2018 on some other key metrics for the full year 2019 we estimate amortization expense of 33 million to 34 million depreciation in the range of 75 million to 78 million and stock compensation of 18 million to 19 million based on our outstanding borrowings and estimates of interest rates for the rest of the year we project that interest expense will approximate 48 million to 50 million on the tax front we are projecting that the structural tax rate will increase from 21 this past year to approximately 24 in 2019 this increase primarily reflects the diminishing impact of stock option exercises on our reported tax expense lastly weighted average shares are projected to approximate 59 million for the year we estimate that we will generate approximately 300 million to 320 million of cash flow from operations and to have 50 million of maintenance capital which would yield 250 million to 275 million of free cash flow for us to invest in the ongoing growth of the business we expect to invest 45 million to 50 million of that in new center capital for centers opening this year and in early 2020 the combination of all these factors lead to our projection of adjusted net income of 209 million to 214 million in 2019 and adjusted eps growth in the low double digits to a range of 3 57 to 3 63 a share looking specifically to q1 we ve seen a decline in foreign exchange rate since q1 of 2018 that we expected to impact growth rates specifically we are projecting approximately 7 top line growth including a foreign exchange headwind of approximately 1 5 on the bottom line we re projecting adjusted net income in the range of 45 million to 46 5 million and adjusted eps in the range of 0 77 to 0 79 a share and so hector with that we are ready to go to q a questions and answers operator thank you at this time we ll be conducting a question and answer session operator instructions our first question comes from the line of andrew steinerman with jpmorgan please proceed with your question michael cho jp morgan analyst hi good evening this is michael cho for andrew my first question is just around the margin this past quarter around in backup it was quite an improvement year over year i mean and i know you called out scale and investments but i was wondering if you can provide a little bit more color behind the margin profile and backup elizabeth boland chief financial officer yes so we have as mentioned on prior calls mike we ve got some variability that can occur in both the backup and ed advising business based on levels of utilization and so there is a fairly strong utilization time period in the fourth quarter with holidays and so that s the main driver is down to the good levels of use that we had and some of our clients are per use clients and so that that use is incremental to the performance and as a result we are seeing that on the topline and then on the bottom line i do think that we re it s too to soon to have seen all of the efficiencies of some of the investments that we re making on that technology and user experience but we are beginning to gain from some of the automation of the reservation process and the matching of service we re seeing some efficiency that is coming into the cost structure so at the margin it all contributes michael cho jp morgan analyst understood if i could just ask a quick follow up on the tech investments i mean and i know stephen had a bit of color around investments in your prepared remarks but i understand kind of just looking for matching and efficiencies but can you give a little bit more insight into kind of what has actually been the benefits and what s actually expected over the near and medium term from these past tech investments thanks stephen kramer president chief executive officer and director sure so the tech investments as you ll know are really focused on driving additional use as well as user experience and so on the driving additional use side i think we ve shown some really good progress as it relates to first engaging more users within a particular employers client base so increasing the numbers of individuals that are registered to use and then ultimately putting them on personalized journeys that allow us to communicate to them when we perceive they may have a need and allowing them to then react to that communication and so from a marketing perspective i think we feel really good about the progress that we re making in that regard both from creating more registrations as well as creating more reservations on the user experience side certainly we see great user experience enhancements across all the lines of service but probably the one that is most significant is in the backup area and very specifically around the ability for an end user to instantly book care and so that is really creating connectivity between the end user and the supply that we have and so it makes it a frictionless process for them to put in a reservation and ultimately get an instant care confirmation and so what that does for the user is it eliminates any of the lag time that there is around whether or not and who is going to serve that care and then secondly from an efficiency standpoint it eliminates some of the cost associated with what had previously been an interaction with the contact center so again i think that from both the marketing perspective as well as from a user experience perspective we re seeing good strides and obviously the impact is both at the top line as well as from a cost structure perspective michael cho jp morgan analyst great thank you operator our next question comes from the line of manav patnaik with barclays please proceed with your question ryan leonard barclays analyst hi this is ryan leonard filling in for manav just a question on the cost in the quarter i guess adjusted ebitda came in a little bit light relative to our expectations were there any costs associated with either the rebranding that you mentioned or maybe some of these college programs you re rolling out for employees elizabeth boland chief financial officer sorry ryan i wasn t able to quite hear you you said with respect to the cost in the quarter ryan leonard barclays analyst yes i think costs were a little bit higher than we had expected and i was just wondering if there s any onetime things to call out whether it d be some of the rebranding or some of the education you re providing for associates that that had any impact that we should be aware of elizabeth boland chief financial officer well we ve had really good i d say on the education program what we re really pleased about is we ve had very good a takeup on the what we re calling the horizons teacher s degree program and have had a very good level of interest and so there is a modest cost associated with that i think it s absorbable in our overall structure so i m not calling that out as an unusual cost we have had a really positive response to it likewise the branding we re excited about what it s going to bring in and it involved some level of cost but not something that s unusual or outsize so i don t think we have anything to call out particularly on the cost front no ryan leonard barclays analyst okay fair enough and then just a quick one if i could on the buyback how should we think of the pace of that or i guess what s assumed in guidance or how do you think of it kind of strategically on your end elizabeth boland chief financial officer yes i mean our view is we have a very predictable cash flow generation business of course and so as i mentioned in the prepared remarks we are expecting to have free cash flow well north of 250 million and so to the extent that we can identify growth opportunities be they acquisitions we do tuck in acquisitions as a matter of course those are part of our standard plan if you will so that is part of our guidance but an outsize acquisition should that come along that would be an opportunity for us to deploy more of that cash we have 100 million or so that we re investing in new centers that we re developing and in maintenance capital but that still leaves a level of cash flow that is predictable from year to year and replenishing year to year that we would be looking to continue to be active with a repurchase program so it the plan considers regular borrowing but we re not really signaling exactly what that is we have a 300 million program that s authorized we ve been regular buyers in the open market and now that bain exited their position earlier in 2018 those larger blocks added to the volume a bit but we would continue to be active stephen kramer president chief executive officer and director and ryan just doubling back to your original assertion around cost i would just observe that we feel really good about the 110 basis point improvement so not really clear what you re referencing on the cost side but again we re really pleased with the performance both from revenue and cost perspective that yielded the margin that we had in the fourth quarter ryan leonard barclays analyst understood thanks operator our next question comes from the line of gary bisbee with bank of america please proceed with your question gary bisbee bank of america analyst hi good afternoon it didn t feel the same without dave bragging on the patriots but as a giants fan i have to say didn t mind not hearing it elizabeth boland chief financial officer we re just trying to cut everybody a break i know it s sort of gary bisbee bank of america analyst so as i sit back and think about the pretty terrific growth you ve driven in the six years since your second ipo i guess i ve been trying to spend some time thinking about how do we think about multiyear growth from here is it would it be fair to project the broad outlines of the 2019 guidance as sustainable growth targets over the next few years and by that i guess i m thinking the eight to 10 revenue the 50 to 100 bps of margin expansion and double digit earnings growth is that reasonable or is given the scale of the company is it just is it getting more difficult i don t know if there s any if you want to give official updates or anything you d point out that we might think about over the next few years thanks stephen kramer president chief executive officer and director sure so i ll start and i m sure elizabeth will play color as well but the way i would start to answer that question is really around the opportunity that we see and we continue to see really strong opportunity in all of the lines of service that we deliver on so in terms of an expectation on the top line i think it s very fair to assume that we will continue to look at an 8 to 10 growth rate based on the fact that when we look at the white space within our existing client base as well as within those who are today not clients we see terrific opportunities for building out additional centers attracting more back up clients and ed advisory clients and then the use within each one of those three categories we see is continuing to have a very positive trend line associated with it and so maybe elizabeth you want to cover up on the margin side elizabeth boland chief financial officer yeah i mean i do think that the 50 to 100 basis points gary we would see as we continue to bed in a little bit of a tailwind with our lease model strategy adding call it 20 25 basis points a year for the next couple of years still that s really more of a mature series or cohorts and then seeing that operating margin ability to expand that in the range more like 25 to 50 or 75 basis points so maybe a call it two three year horizon on the 50 to 100 and then tapering a bit but the inherent structural elements of the model do offer modest opportunities for leverage when we are both vigilant about cost management labor intensive business and then making smart investments that allow us to enable technology to support the service delivery in our back up and ed advising in a more effective way and in a more user conscious way those things were both costless and be a better experience for the end user so i think there s a lot to execute to get that done but i think that our view is we do have some inherent business model elements that allow for ongoing leverage and so as you say a conversion of top line growth at a faster pace so in the double digit range certainly probably lower double digits but that is sustainable gary bisbee bank of america analyst okay and one of the keys obviously to margins historically has been the ability to price in excess of labor cost inflation that you re paying out i ve always thought it s dangerous to think long term 3 to 5 every year for as many years as you ve done it is there anything does that become more difficult to get at some point or do you feel like where you are relative to people s ability to pay and relative to the market continues to remain in a compelling level such that you could continue to pass on this price over several more years elizabeth boland chief financial officer yeah i think that the it s important to keep it at the structure where there s a bit of gaap and we target 1 gaap at lease room for some variability but to have a gaap whether the wage rates are going up at 3 or 2 and flexing according to that not getting ahead of ourselves on how much we will price but i think that we ve got a long track record of having the ability to price in a way that we have and to be transparent with parents and to have a service that they are able to afford because of other both what they re earning and or the employer support to it so it s something we pay a lot of attention to again don t want to sound either complacent about it or that it doesn t get a lot of focus but we are geographic location by location making pricing determinations and adjusting according to that market and the demand profile so i think that there s a long winded way of saying we think we can sustain price increases and to absorb the kinds of cost increases that we ve seen over the last couple of years with wage rates both modestly ticking up a bit faster than they had been and the movement behind minimum wages in certain locations where we ve always had reasonable visibility there and stayed ahead of that pricing gary bisbee bank of america analyst and then just one last one if i could on the lease consortium good to see them contributing or the drag no longer there from margins does the contributing in 2018 does that mean that the gross margins for that business are now above the corporate average or does that just mean that the drag is less in some way and i guess i m trying to think of yeah go ahead elizabeth boland chief financial officer it s more that the drag if the drag is less i mean as a cohort they re still in the high single digits to low double digits and that s the range of where they would be as a cohort so they re still not contributing at the overall rate of the full service segment but they are not absorbing more losses so it s becoming a positive and so that s why there is a little bit more runway there gary for there to be an extra 20 25 basis points from the lease consortium through the next couple of years as they continue to i think you may have been the person who asked us a couple of years ago but what level how many years of this would you have and do you got a mature cohort but we re six years in another three years four years while 10 years of these centers only two to three years that are not mature that s when we would really consider to be at a sort of a just rolling level and so i m going on too long i mean with answers but that s the gist of it we see a little bit of continued opportunity there gary bisbee bank of america analyst great thank you very much elizabeth boland chief financial officer yeah operator our next question comes from the line of jeff meuler with baird please proceed with your question jeff meuler baird analyst yeah thank you good afternoon the my family care acquisition does that have a sizable backup component to it and can you just refresh us on our backup business in the u k and i guess the netherlands if it s applicable stephen kramer president chief executive officer and director yeah good afternoon jeff thank you for the question so we did acquire recently the my family care in the u k and their focus and their business really is in the backup segment and so if we take a step back and why that was an important acquisition for us we believe we re in the really early innings of the backup opportunity in the u k and our backup opportunity outside the u s today is the u k and they were very focused on the u k as well so as one of our main competitors i think from an opportunity perspective it s a really nice pickup for us a few things that we think make it particularly attractive one is it came along with obviously economics again both our business in the u k as well as their business is relatively small so i would characterize it no different from a tuck in acquisition that we might do on the center side that s sort of the scale that we re talking about on the other hand it came along with some important client partnerships it came along with some solid technology and i think lastly but quite importantly it came along with some really high quality people that have been dedicated to the backup space similar to us for a number of years now and so we see the combination of our backup business and my family care s backup business as a really good platform to continue to accelerate the momentum in that u k market for backup care in the netherlands we don t have a backup care business in fact there is no market in today s economy there for backup so this is really about u k opportunity jeff meuler baird analyst thank you for that and then i hear you on the branding and branding all of the services around bright horizons any other initiatives change in sales force change in compensation to get after the big opportunity of cross selling to take it well beyond the i guess 250 clients stephen kramer president chief executive officer and director yes so i think we re really staying the course there we made some sort of fundamental structural changes over the last 18 months and believe now we re well positioned to go after that opportunity as i ve shared on previous calls things that we have implemented are one that the sales folks are really partnering with our account management team to go after our existing client base we created a small enterprise team that is focused on some of the more complex large opportunities so again i think we ve done some really good things around the team itself and then as you rightly mentioned i think we have now aligned our incentives so that our teams are really focused on not only bringing new clients into the family but also making sure that we are really going after the opportunity that exists within our existing client base jeff meuler baird analyst okay thank you and then just one last one so what is the outlook intermediate long term now on the backup care margins and i guess i m just it seemed like the messaging was hey we have really good margins in that business it s very economic to us it s a growth business the growth is still there but it sounds like maybe you re starting to see some of the pay offs on the investments and structurally they could improve the margins of the business so is there going to be reinvestment and should we still think of backup care as a fuller margin story or are you seeing an inflection following those investments and should it would you expect it to be a business with margin expansion over a multiyear horizon elizabeth boland chief financial officer well i think our view on back up is as it continues to mature of course there s a number of factors that go into the overall the mix of where we are providing care the mix of clients who are capitated and sort of a of buying a basket of uses versus pre use and so there s some elements of that that will evolve over time we think that the margin for this full year so in q4 it was over 30 for the full year of 2018 it was in the high 20 s and we would expect that being able to stay in that range and maybe tick up modestly toward the 30 range is possible with the efficiencies that come with these we will continue to invest but the efficiencies should come through but i do think that at a 30 level and with the clients that we re working with that will be a reasonable target for us to sustain in that level rather than a much leverage beyond that jeff jeff meuler baird analyst got it thank you stephen kramer president chief executive officer and director thanks jeff operator operator instructions our next question comes from the line of with george tong with goldman sachs please proceed with your question brian zimmerman goldman sachs analyst you have brian on for george today you mentioned that you plan to organically add 50 new centers in 2019 can you talk about how the pace of new openings compared with earlier periods taking into account competitive dynamics industry penetration and customer spending intentions elizabeth boland chief financial officer yes i mean it s a fairly consistent expectation the mix of those centers we would expect to be in the 12 to 15 would be lease consortium models that we are citing and another 15 to 20 would be client centers so what we re seeing is continued interest from the industries that we ve seen good penetration in the healthcare pharmaceuticals the tech sector has been a bit more active the last couple of years and that we would continue to see colleges universities as new clients and expanding their footprint so from a client spending standpoint this tends to be a fairly long decision cadence we haven t really seen a different pace just a steady pace from clients on the spending side hence they re relatively similar level of new centers that we d expect to open brian zimmerman goldman sachs analyst great thanks and then for my last question can you discuss how enrollment and pricing trends have been performing in light of tightening labor market and later cycle economic environment elizabeth boland chief financial officer yes so we as we had anticipated for 2018 we saw about 1 enrollment gain in our mature centers and then we of course have ramping centers that contribute as well but pretty solid enrollment in the mature base with our labor rates as i mentioned before the labor has been seen a little bit firmer wage increase we do wage increases every year it s not a new thing but we re seeing wages climbing more like to 2 5 to 3 on average and in some cases where there are markets that are having seattle for example had put in a minimum wage law several years ago that has been introduced over the course of many years in that environment over the last couple of years we ve seen wages climbing a bit faster we pay above minimum wage but it still has an effect on all kinds of companies like ours that are working with workforce that s competing against some of the minimum wage jobs so in that way we re seeing again staying ahead of the labor rates but probably 2 5 to 3 on average brian zimmerman goldman sachs analyst great thank you operator our next question comes from the line of hamzah mazari with macquarie please proceed with your question mario cortellucci macquarie analyst this is mario cortellacci filling in for hamzah i know you guys already touched on the work that you re kind of doing in order to cross sell and increase the number of subscription you have from clients but i guess you guys are around like that 21 22 range right now and just wanted to see if you think that 2019 we could see that accelerate or even over the longer term how big do you think that number could be realistically stephen kramer president chief executive officer and director yes so the way we look at it is we obviously look at our existing client base and have very strong relationships with those clients we have an understanding as it relates to what services the particular clients would benefit from so we really do a bottoms up analysis to figure out client by client what services their them as an employer and their employees would benefit from and then obviously we try to introduce those services to them in an appropriate way so i think the hardest part about seeing the percentage move up is that we continue to see that many new clients to the bright horizons family come into our organization investing in a single service and so we continue to grow the number of single service clients while at the same time we continue to increase the number of cross sells that ultimately add additional services to existing clients so what we re really focused on is less about the percentage although that will tick up naturally over time and really focused on the number of clients who are investing in multiple services and we ve seen really nice progress as it relates to the numbers of our clients that are investing in multiple services mario cortellucci macquarie analyst got it okay and just one more could you maybe talk about your m a pipeline internationally whether markets like france or australia or even certain asian countries are attractive and whether there are platforms or platform deals you could do in those regions stephen kramer president chief executive officer and director absolutely it s a great question and the quick answer is yes so we continue to monitor where we think we could add value by operating in a particular country when we think about countries that are most appropriate for our expansion plans we re really looking for those countries that have some source of third party financial support for child care and so that can come in the form of government as it is in the place like the netherlands or it can come in the form of employers like we have here in the united states and so there are many countries throughout europe as well as in asia and as you mentioned australia where one or both of those two possibilities exist so again we try not to speculate which country will necessarily be next on the other hand we continue to look for ways to keep good relationships with platform as you call them opportunities throughout the world and there are a number of those in each of the countries that we are evaluating and so we continue to keep great relationships and at the point where they re ready to sell and or it makes sense for us to go to a particular place we ll be on the ready and i think as we demonstrated from the experience in the netherlands we have the ability to go in with a platform type acquisition and then grow both organically and through additional acquisition to create quite a presence in a market mario cortellucci macquarie analyst great thank you so much stephen kramer president chief executive officer and director thank you elizabeth boland chief financial officer welcome operator our next question comes from the line of jeff silber with bmo capital markets please proceed with your question jeff silber bmo capital markets analyst thanks so much wanted to focus actually on your first quarter guidance i know it s the first time you ve given it and it seems like consensus was a little bit ahead of your guidance or maybe we got out over our skis a little bit you called out fx pressure i m just wondering if there s anything specifically going on did you have any impact from the government shutdown et cetera elizabeth boland chief financial officer we really didn t have much effect we do run centers for a number of government agencies jeff and had i think one or two centers that had just one center had to close others had funding elsewhere that they were able to continue to stay open during the shutdown and serve families so not an impact from the government shutdown in the first quarter i think it s mostly a comp versus i mean fx is certainly a factor and a comp against what had been a first quarter that had not only high foreign exchange in relation to this year but it was higher in relation to the year before that otherwise we feel really good about the overall components the same full service growth components would play in the first quarter and we ve just had solid backup new client launches and we feel good about the kickoff to the year there too so nothing else to call out in terms of unexpected cost that were heavy jeff silber bmo capital markets analyst okay that s helpful and as my follow up i know we talked a little bit about wage inflation before i m just curious just focusing on your center staff considering what s going on in the labor market are you seeing higher than normal turnover or having difficulty finding people stephen kramer president chief executive officer and director yeah so one of the key features of bright horizons as an organization is we really are an employer of choice and we spend a tremendous amount of time and have over our 30 year history investing in our culture and investing in our people and so we haven t actually experienced any difference in the turnover rates i think that once someone determines that this is the field that they want to be in we like to think that they re excited to be a practitioner within our organization and i think our turnover rates suggest that and to put a fine point on it our turnover rates at bright horizons are about half of the industry average and that s been consistent and in fact in a market like the one we re in it s actually a little bit less than half because again i think we have real stability in our workforce and i think others are struggling in the way that you described jeff silber bmo capital markets analyst okay great that s helpful thanks so much stephen kramer president chief executive officer and director thank you elizabeth boland chief financial officer thanks jeff stephen kramer president chief executive officer and director wonderful well thank you again for joining us on the call we appreciate the questions and the insights so wishing you all a good night and looking forward to seeing you out on the road

which we also refer to as adjusted earnings per share or adjusted eps v ebitda and adjusted ebitda these measures are not recognized measurements under united states generally accepted accounting principles or gaap when analyzing our operating performance investors should use them in addition to and not as an alternative for their most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap because not all companies use identical calculations our presentation of these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies our management generally uses these non gaap financial measures to evaluate operating performance and for other discretionary purposes the company believes that these measures provide a more complete understanding of ongoing operations enhance comparability of current results to prior periods and may be useful for investors to analyze our financial performance because they eliminate the impact of selected charges that may obscure trends in the underlying performance of our business the company further uses certain of these measures and believes that they are useful to investors for purposes described below with respect to fee revenue and organic fee revenue the company believes that investors may find these measures useful to analyze the financial performance of our occupier outsourcing and property management business lines and our business generally fee revenue excludes costs reimbursable by clients and as such provides greater visibility into the underlying performance of our business organic fee revenue for the three months ended december 31 2018 further excludes contributions from all acquisitions completed after fourth quarter 2017 organic fee revenue for the twelve

fourth quarter 2017 for the three months ended december 31 2018 with respect to adjusted net income adjusted eps ebitda and adjusted ebitda the company believes that investors may find these measures useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because their calculations generally eliminate the accounting effects of acquisitions which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions and in the case of ebitda and adjusted ebitda the effects of financings and income tax and the accounting effects of capital spending all of these measures may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance in the case of ebitda and adjusted ebitda these measures are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for our management s discretionary use because they do not consider cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments the ebitda and adjusted ebitda measures calculated herein may also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our credit facilities and debt instruments which amounts are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non cash charges and are used by us to determine compliance with financial covenants therein and our ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments the company also uses adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps as significant components when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive compensation programs

china s growth rate remains impressive even if on the decline the country s continuing economic gains owe much to the chinese state s 1 still considerable ability to direct the activity of critical economic enterprises and sectors such as finance 2 commitment to policies of economic expansion and 3 flexibility in economic strategy it appears that china s leaders view their recently adopted one belt one road initiative as key to the country s future economic vitality however there are reasons to believe that this strategy is seriously flawed with working people including in china destined to pay a high price for its shortcomings chinese growth trends downward china grew rapidly over the decades of the 1980s 1990s and 2000s with production and investment increasingly powered by the country s growing integration into regional cross border production networks by 2002 china had become the world s biggest recipient of foreign direct investment and by 2009 it had overtaken germany to become the world s biggest exporter not surprisingly the great recession and the decline in world trade that followed represented a major challenge to the county s export oriented growth strategy the government s response was to counter the effects of declining external demand with a major investment program financed by massive money creation and low interest rates investment as a share of gdp rose to an all time high of 48 percent in december 2011 and remains at over 44 percent of gdp but despite the government s efforts growth steadily declined from 10 6 in 2010 to 6 7 in 2016 before registering an increase of 6 9 in 2017 current predictions are for a further decline in 2018 beginning in 2012 the chinese government began promoting the idea of a new normal centered around a target rate of growth of 6 5 the government claimed that the benefits of this new normal growth rate would include greater stability and a more domestically oriented growth process that would benefit chinese workers however in contrast to its rhetoric the state continued to pursue a high grow rate by promoting a massive state supported construction boom tied to a policy of expanded urbanization new roads railways airports shopping centers and apartment complexes were built as might be expected such a big construction push has left the country with excess facilities and infrastructure highlighted by a growing number of ghost towns as the south china morning post describes six skyscrapers overlooking a huge man made lake once seemed like a dazzling illustration of a city s ambition the transformation of desert on the edge of ordos in inner mongolia into a gleaming residential and commercial complex to help secure its future prosperity at noon on a cold winter s day the reality seemed rather different only a handful of people could be seen entering or exiting the buildings with hardly a trace of activity in the 42 storey skyscrapers the complex opened five years ago but just three of its buildings have been sold to the city government and another is occupied by its developer a bank and an energy company the remaining two are empty gates blocked and dust piled on the ground ordos however was just one project in china s rush to urbanize the nation used more cement in the three years from 2011 to 2013 than the united states used in the entire 20th century other mostly empty ghost towns can be found across china including the yujiapu financial district in tianjin the chenggong district in kunming in yunnan and yingkou in liaoning province this building boom was financed by a rapid increase in debt creating repayment concerns corporate debt in particular soared but local government and household debt also grew substantially the boom also caused several industries to dramatically increase their scale of production creating serious overcapacity problems as the researcher xin zhang points out over the past decade scholars and government officials have held a stable consensus that nine traditional industries in china are most severely exposed to the excess capacity problem steel cement plate glass electrolytic aluminium coal ship building solar energy wind energy and petrochemical all of these nine sectors are related to energy infrastructural construction and real estate development reflecting the nature of a heavily investment driven economy for china not surprisingly this situation has also led to a significant decline in economy wide rates of return according to xin zhang despite strong overall growth performance the capital return rate of the chinese economy has started to be on a sharp decline recently although the results vary by different estimation methods research in and outside china points out a recent downward trend for example two economists show that all through the 1980s and the first half of the 1990s the capital return rate of the chinese economy had been relatively stable at about 0 22 much higher than the u s counterpart however since the mid 1990s the capital return rate experienced more ups and downs until the dramatic drop to about 0 14 in 2013 since then the return to capital within chinese economy has decreased even further creating the phenomenon of a capital glut in other words it was becoming increasingly unlikely that the chinese state could stabilize growth pursuing its existing strategy in fact it appears that many wealthy chinese have decided that their best play is to move their money out of the country a china economic review article highlights this development since 2015 the specter of capital flight has been haunting the chinese economy in that year faced with the threat of a currency devaluation and an aggressive anti corruption campaign investors and savers began moving their wealth out of china the outflow was so large that the central bank was forced to spend more than 1 trillion of its foreign exchange reserves to defend the exchange rate the chinese government was eventually able to dam up the flow of capital out of its borders by imposing strict capital controls and china s balance of payments exchange rate and foreign currency reserves have all stabilized but even the largest dam cannot stop the rain it can only keep water from flowing further downstream there are now several signs that the conditions that originally led to the first massive wave of capital flight have returned the strength of china s capital controls might soon be put to the test chinese leaders were not blind to the mounting economic difficulties limits to domestic construction were apparent as was the danger that unused buildings and factories coupled with excess capacity in key industries could easily trigger widespread defaults on the part of borrowers and threaten the stability of the financial sector growing labor activism on the part of workers struggling with low salaries and dangerous working conditions added to their concern however despite earlier voiced support for the notion of a new normal growth tied to slower but more worker friendly and domestically oriented economic activity the party leadership appears to have chosen a new strategy one that seeks to maintain the existing growth process by expanding it beyond china s national borders its one belt and one road initiative

on the 40th anniversary of the islamic revolution this past friday supreme leader ayatollah khamenei made an effort to express iran s geopolitical stance in simple terms we have good relations with all nations in the world we don t want to break relations with any european nation and an explanation of the slogan death to america the ayatollah said death to america means death to trump john bolton and mike pompeo it means death to american rulers we have no problems with the american people so the slogan is indeed a metaphor as in death to us foreign policy as conducted for much of the past four decades that includes of course the dismantling by the trump administration of the nuclear deal with iran known as the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa in a rash rebuke of the centrist government of president hassan rouhani and foreign minister muhammad javad zarif who negotiated the jcpoa with the obama administration as well as russia china france the uk and germany khamenei stressed he would not have signed it his legendary distrust of the us now seems more than vindicated payment system for the europeans who signed the jcpoa what s left is trying to pick up the pieces enter instex the instrument in support of trade exchanges a mechanism backed by the european union with its headquarters in paris and run by a german banker which in theory allows european banks and companies to keep trading with iran without being fined extra territorially by the us department of justice or being totally excluded from the american market french foreign minister jean yves le drian called it an important geopolitical gesture but a gesture may not be enough especially because initially it just covers humanitarian goods sold to iran such as pharmaceuticals food and medical supplies tehran pays instex and instex reimburses the food and pharma companies involved further on down the road small and medium sized european companies might also use instex to trade with iran without being slapped with us sanctions what s crucial in the long run about instex is that the mechanism bypasses the us dollar so it will be under immense scrutiny all across the global south instex won t replace the swift payment system anytime soon because the capitalization is set at only 1 billion the thing is whether other heavyweights such as russia china and turkey will start using instex to bypass us dollars and sanctions trading way beyond humanitarian goods instex although an embryonic response shows how brussels and major european capitals are exasperated by the trump administration s unilateralism diplomats have been saying on and off the record that nothing will prevent the europeans from doing business with iran buying their energy investing in their market and bypassing the us dollar in the process this has the potential to offer some breathing space to president rouhani the latest internal polls reveal that 40 years after the islamic revolution over 70 of iranians of all social classes have zero trust in any negotiations involving the us government and that even includes an increasing number of millennials for whom the islamic revolution is just an echo of a distant past that may not be the exact sentiment in teherangeles california the capital of the iranian diaspora which may number over half a million people worldwide mostly upper middle class but it does reflect the pulse of the nation paymon crypto alternative over and over again the rouhani administration must tackle an insurmountable contradiction national pride boosted by iran recapturing its role as a major power in southwest asia is always undermined by intimations of social despair as in countless families surviving on less than 200 a month under rampant inflation and suffering the effects of the non stop fall of the rial whatever the feel good factors constantly exhorted by the government already in regard to instex there has been a backlash iran has been told it must join the financial action task force fatf a global body that seeks to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism and that it must compromise on its missile program which it regards as non negotiable the chief of iran s judiciary ayatollah sadeq amoli larijani branded the two conditions set by the europeans as humiliating and on the european front there s no evidence yet that small companies trust that the instex payment system will make them immune to retaliatory action by the us iranians though are opening other creative fronts four banks bank melli bank mellat parsian bank and bank pasargad have developed a gold backed cryptocurrency named paymon and negotiations are already advanced with the europeans as well as russia switzerland and south africa to expand paymon trading iranian officials are adamant that blockchain will be crucial to improve the nation s economy the iranian move mirrors venezuela s action in launching its own oil backed cryptocurrency the petro last october but count on the blocking iran illicit finance act to swing into overdrive in the us congress meanwhile russia and iran have all but bypassed the us dollar in bilateral trade using only ruble and rial and in case of urgent need the euro if we have no other options according to the russian ambassador to iran levan dzhagaryan china russia iran and turkey the four key vectors of ongoing eurasia integration are investing in bypassing the us dollar on trade by any mechanism necessary the eurasia economic union eaeu is also working on a common system for boosting economic sovereignty as defined by president putin it has free trade agreements with an array of partners including china and iran arab nato roll call this is the background in the run up towards what is essentially an anti iran conference convened by the trump administration in warsaw this wednesday no one in europe that really matters wants to be publicly associated with iranian demonization federica mogherini the eu foreign policy chief is not going eu wide businesses increasingly tell their puny political leaders that the way to go is greater eurasia from lisbon to vladivostok from murmansk to mumbai with tehran in between and everything linked to the china driven belt and road initiative poland is an exception ruled by hardcore nationalists it has been lobbying for a permanent us military base which president andrzej duda wants to call fort trump unable to force france the uk germany and italy out of doing business with iran what s left for washington is to have persian gulf governors plus israel assembled in the same room pledging their efforts towards an ill defined anti iran arab nato what this will certainly accomplish inside iran is to promote even more hardliners and principlists who are lobbying for a return to former president ahmadinejad s look east strategy iran is already looking east considering its top asian energy clients and the close ties with the belt and road initiative and the eaeu team rouhani now knows in realpolitik terms they cannot trust the us and the eu is an immensely problematic partner the next major step would be for iran to become a full member of the shanghai cooperation organization china wants it and russia wants it venezuela looks to have been targeted for regime change essentially because it s trying to bypass the us dollar on trade that should not be a problem for iran which has been a target for regime change for decades top photo iranian president hassan rouhani walks to his car after exiting the

modern monetary theory mmt is getting significant media attention these days after rep alexandria ocasio cortez said in an interview that it should be a larger part of our conversation when it comes to funding the green new deal according to mmt the government can spend what it needs without worrying about deficits mmt expert and bernie sanders adviser professor stephanie kelton says the government actually creates money when it spends the real limit on spending is not an artificially imposed debt ceiling but a lack of labor and materials to do the work leading to generalized price inflation only when that real ceiling is hit does the money need to be taxed back but even then it s not to fund government spending instead it s needed to shrink the money supply in an economy that has run out of resources to put the extra money to work predictably critics have been quick to rebut calling the trend to endorse mmt disturbing and a joke that s not funny in a feb 1 post on the daily reckoning brian maher darkly envisioned bernie sanders getting elected in 2020 and implementing quantitative easing for the people based on mmt theories to debunk the notion that governments can just print the money to solve their economic problems he raised the specter of venezuela where money is everywhere but bare essentials are out of reach for many the storefronts are empty unemployment is at 33 percent and inflation is predicted to hit 1 million percent by the end of the year blogger arnold kling also pointed to the venezuelan hyperinflation he described mmt as the doctrine that because the government prints money it can spend whatever it wants until it can t he said to me the hyperinflation in venezuela exemplifies what happens when a country reaches the it can t point the country is not at full employment but the government can t seem to spend its way out of difficulty somebody should ask these mmt rock stars about the venezuela example i m not an mmt rock star and won t try to expound on its subtleties i would submit that under existing regulations the government cannot actually create money when it spends but that it should be able to in fact mmters have acknowledged that problem but it s a subject for another article what i want to address here is the hyperinflation issue and why venezuelan hyperinflation and qe for the people are completely different animals what is different about venezuela venezuela s problems are not the result of the government issuing money and using it to hire people to build infrastructure provide essential services and expand economic development if it were unemployment would not be at 33 percent and climbing venezuela has a problem the u s does not and will never have it owes massive debts in a currency it cannot print itself namely u s dollars when oil its principal resource was booming venezuela was able to meet its repayment schedule but when the price of oil plummeted the government was reduced to printing venezuelan bolivars and selling them for u s dollars on international currency exchanges as speculators drove up the price of dollars more and more printing was required by the government massively deflating the national currency it was the same problem suffered by weimar germany and zimbabwe the two classic examples of hyperinflation typically raised to silence proponents of government expansion of the money supply before venezuela suffered the same fate professor michael hudson an actual economic rock star who supports mmt principles has studied the hyperinflation question extensively he confirms that those disasters were not due to governments issuing money to stimulate the economy rather he writes every hyperinflation in history has been caused by foreign debt service collapsing the exchange rate the problem almost always has resulted from wartime foreign currency strains not domestic spending venezuela and other countries that are carrying massive debts in currencies that are not their own are not sovereign governments that are sovereign can and have engaged in issuing their own currencies for infrastructure and development quite successfully i have discussed a number of contemporary and historical examples in my earlier articles including in japan china australia and canada although venezuela is not technically at war it is suffering from foreign currency strains triggered by aggressive attacks by a foreign power u s economic sanctions have been going on for years causing the country at least 20 billion in losses about 7 billion of its assets are now being held hostage by the u s which has waged an undeclared war against venezuela ever since george w bush s failed military coup against president hugo chávez in 2002 chávez boldly announced the bolivarian revolution a series of economic and social reforms that dramatically reduced poverty and illiteracy as well as improved health and living conditions for millions of venezuelans the reforms which included nationalizing key components of the nation s economy made chávez a hero to millions of people and the enemy of venezuela s oligarchs nicolás maduro was elected president following chávez s death in 2013 and vowed to continue the bolivarian revolution recently as saddam hussein and moammar gadhafi had done before him he defiantly announced that venezuela would not be trading oil in u s dollars following sanctions imposed by president trump the notorious elliott abrams has now been appointed as special envoy to venezuela considered a war criminal by many for covering up massacres committed by u s backed death squads in central america abrams was among the prominent neocons closely linked to bush s failed venezuelan coup in 2002 national security adviser john bolton is another key neocon architect advocating regime change in venezuela at press conference on jan 28 he held a yellow legal pad prominently displaying the words 5 000 troops to colombia a country that shares a border with venezuela clearly the neocon contingent feels it has unfinished business there bolton does not even pretend that it s all about restoring democracy he blatantly said on fox news it will make a big difference to the united states economically if we could have american oil companies invest in and produce the oil capabilities in venezuela as president nixon said of u s tactics against salvador allende s government in chile the point of sanctions and military threats is to squeeze the country economically killing the public banking revolution in venezuela it may be about more than oil which recently hit record lows in the market the u s hardly needs to invade a country to replenish its supplies as with libya and iraq another motive may be to suppress the banking revolution initiated by venezuela s upstart leaders the banking crisis of 2009 10 exposed the corruption and systemic weakness of venezuelan banks some banks were engaged in questionable business practices others were seriously undercapitalized others still were apparently lending top executives large sums of money at least one financier could not prove where he got the money to buy the banks he owned rather than bailing out the culprits as was done in the u s in 2009 the government nationalized seven venezuelan banks accounting for around 12 percent of the nation s bank deposits in 2010 more were taken over chávez s government arrested at least 16 bankers and issued more than 40 corruption related arrest warrants for others who had fled the country by the end of march 2011 only 37 banks were left down from 59 at the end of november 2009 state owned institutions took a larger role holding 35 percent of assets as of march 2011 while foreign institutions held just 13 2 percent of assets over the howls of the media in 2010 chávez took the bold step of passing legislation defining the banking industry as one of public service the legislation specified that 5 percent of the banks net profits must go toward funding community council projects designed and implemented by communities for the benefit of communities the venezuelan government directed the allocation of bank credit to preferred sectors of the economy and it increasingly became involved in private financial institutions operations by law nearly half the lending portfolios of venezuelan banks had to be directed to particular mandated sectors of the economy including small business and agriculture in a 2012 article titled venezuela increases banks obligatory social contributions u s and europe do not rachael boothroyd said that the venezuelan government was requiring the banks to give back housing was declared a constitutional right and venezuelan banks were obliged to contribute 15 percent of their yearly earnings to securing it the government s great housing mission aimed to build 2 7 million free houses for low income families before 2019 the goal was to create a social banking system that contributed to the development of society rather than simply siphoning off its wealth boothroyd wrote venezuelans are in the fortunate position of having a national government which prioritizes their life quality wellbeing and development over the health of bankers and lobbyists pay checks if the 2009 financial crisis demonstrated anything it was that capitalism is quite simply incapable of regulating itself and that is precisely where progressive governments and progressive government legislation needs to step in that is also where in the u s the progressive wing of the democratic party is stepping in and why ocasio cortez s proposals evoke howls in the media of the sort seen in venezuela article i section 8 of the constitution gives congress the power to create the nation s money supply congress needs to exercise that power the key to restoring our economic sovereignty is to reclaim the power to issue money from a commercial banking system that acknowledges no public responsibility beyond maximizing profits for its shareholders bank created money is backed by the full faith and credit of the united states including federal deposit insurance access to the fed s lending window and government bailouts when things go wrong if we the people are backing the currency it should be issued by the people through their representative government today s government however does not adequately represent the people which is why we first need to take our government back thankfully that is exactly what ocasio cortez and her congressional allies are attempting to do

for two years in the early 1990s richard palmer served as the cia station chief in the united states moscow embassy the events unfolding around him the dissolution of the soviet union and the rise of russia were so chaotic so traumatic and exhilarating that they mostly eluded clearheaded analysis but from all the intelligence that washed over his desk palmer acquired a crystalline understanding of the deeper narrative of those times to hear more feature stories see our full list or get the audm iphone app washington told itself a comforting story that minimized the importance of this outbreak of kleptomania these were criminal outliers and rogue profiteers rushing to exploit the weakness of the new state this narrative infuriated palmer he wanted to shake congress into recognizing that the thieves were the very elites who presided over every corner of the system for the u s to be like russia is today american officialdom palmer believed had badly misjudged russia washington had placed its faith in the new regime s elites it took them at their word when they professed their commitment to democratic capitalism but palmer had seen up close how the world s growing interconnectedness and global finance in particular could be deployed for ill during the cold war the kgb had developed an expert understanding of the banking byways of the west and spymasters had become adept at dispensing cash to agents abroad that proficiency facilitated the amassing of new fortunes in the dying days of the u s s r palmer had watched as his old adversaries in soviet intelligence shoveled billions from the state treasury into private accounts across europe and the u s it was one of history s greatest heists washington told itself a comforting story that minimized the importance of this outbreak of kleptomania these were criminal outliers and rogue profiteers rushing to exploit the weakness of the new state this narrative infuriated palmer he wanted to shake congress into recognizing that the thieves were the very elites who presided over every corner of the system for the u s to be like russia is today he explained to the house committee it would be necessary to have massive corruption by the majority of the members at congress as well as by the departments of justice and treasury and agents of the fbi cia dia irs marshal service border patrol state and local police officers the federal reserve bank supreme court justices in his testimony palmer even mentioned russia s newly installed and little known prime minister whom he mistakenly referred to as boris putin accusing him of helping to loot russia this unillusioned spook was a prophet and he spoke out at a hinge moment in the history of global corruption america could not afford to delude itself into assuming that it would serve as the virtuous model much less emerge as an untainted bystander yet when yegor gaidar a reformist russian prime minister in the earliest postcommunist days asked the united states for help hunting down the billions that the kgb had carted away the white house refused the united states palmer made clear had allowed itself to become an accomplice in this plunder his assessment was unsparing the west could have turned away this stolen cash it could have stanched the outflow to shell companies and tax havens instead western banks waved russian loot into their vaults palmer s anger was intended to provoke a bout of introspection and to fuel anxiety about the risk that rising kleptocracy posed to the west itself after all the russians would have a strong interest in protecting their relocated assets they would want to shield this wealth from moralizing american politicians who might clamor to seize it eighteen years before special counsel robert mueller began his investigation into foreign interference in a u s election palmer warned congress about russian political donations to u s politicians and political parties to obtain influence what was at stake could well be systemic contagion russian values might infect and then weaken the moral defense systems of american politics and business this unillusioned spook was a prophet and he spoke out at a hinge moment in the history of global corruption america could not afford to delude itself into assuming that it would serve as the virtuous model much less emerge as an untainted bystander yet when yegor gaidar a reformist russian prime minister in the earliest postcommunist days asked the united states for help hunting down the billions that the kgb had carted away the white house refused capital flight is capital flight was how one former cia official summed up the american rationale for idly standing by but this was capital flight on an unprecedented scale and mere prologue to an era of rampant theft when the berkeley economist gabriel zucman studied the problem in 2015 he found that 52 percent of russia s wealth resided outside the country as in the russian case much of this plundered wealth finds its way to the united states the contagion has spread remarkably quickly which is not to say steadily in a country haunted since its founding by the perils of corruption the united states has had seizures of conscience en route to the top of the new global order surveyed by the british journalist oliver bullough in his excellent book remarkably quickly which is not to say steadily in a country haunted since its founding by the perils of corruption the united states has had seizures of conscience en route to the top of the new global order surveyed by the british journalist oliver bullough in his excellent book moneyland why thieves and crooks now rule the world and how to take it back in the months following palmer s testimony the zeitgeist swerved in the direction he urged at least momentarily newspaper articles in the fall of 1999 showed how billions in russian money some of it seemingly tied to an alleged crime boss had landed in the bank of new york these sums startled bill clinton s administration which readied tough new anti money laundering bills designed to stiffen banking regulations but the administration was in its last year and passing any new law would have required a legislative slog and bull rushing obstreperous lobbyists so plans stalled the collapse of communism in the other post soviet states along with china s turn toward capitalism only added to the kleptocratic fortunes that were hustled abroad for secret safekeeping officials around the world have always looted their countries coffers and accumulated bribes but the globalization of banking made the export of their ill gotten money far more convenient than it had been which of course inspired more theft by one estimate more than 1 trillion now exits the world s developing countries each year in the forms of laundered money and evaded taxes as in the russian case much of this plundered wealth finds its way to the united states new york los angeles and miami have joined london as the world s most desired destinations for laundered money this boom has enriched the american elites who have enabled it and it has degraded the nation s political and social mores in the process while everyone else was heralding an emergent globalist world that would take on the best values of america palmer had glimpsed the dire risk of the opposite that the values of the kleptocrats would become america s own this grim vision is now nearing fruition the clinton era proposals would have remained an unvisited curio in the national archives had osama bin laden not attacked but in the days after the twin towers collapsed george w bush s administration furiously scoured washington for ideas to jam into the 342 page piece of legislation that would become the patriot act a sense of national panic created a brief moment for bureaucrats to realize previously shelved plans title iii of the act a sense of national panic created a brief moment for bureaucrats to realize previously shelved plans title iii of the patriot act the international money laundering abatement and anti terrorist financing act was signed into law little more than a month

this section of the bill was a monumental legislative achievement undeterred by the smoke clouds of crisis representatives of the big banks had stalked the senate trying to quash the measure citibank officials reportedly got into shouting matches with congressional staffers in the hall this anger reflected the force of the patriot act if a bank came across suspicious money transferred from abroad it was now required to report the transfer to the government a bank could face criminal charges for failing to establish sufficient safeguards against the flow of corrupt cash little wonder that banks fought fiercely against the imposition of so many new rules which required them to bulk up their compliance divisions and more to the point subjected them to expensive penalties for laxity act if a

subjected them to expensive penalties for laxity much of what palmer had urged was suddenly the law of the land but nestled in the patriot act lay the handiwork of another industry s lobbyists every house district in the country has real estate and lobbyists for that business had pleaded for relief from the act lay the handiwork of another industry s lobbyists every house district in the country

the financial system foreigners could still buy penthouse apartments or mansions anonymously and with ease by hiding behind shell companies set up in states such as delaware and nevada those states along with a few others had turned the registration of shell companies into a hugely lucrative racket and it was stunningly simple to arrange such a potemkin front on behalf of a dictator a drug dealer or an oligarch according to global witness a london based anti corruption ngo founded in 1993 the united states palmer made clear had allowed itself to become an accomplice to this plunder much

at columbus circle in manhattan were owned by a constellation of kleptocrats one condo belonged to the family of a former russian senator whose suspected ties to organized crime precluded him from legally entering canada for a few years a condo down the hall belonged to a greek businessman who had recently been arrested in an anti government corruption sweep the family of a former colombian governor imprisoned for self enrichment while in office owned a unit he could no longer visit times found were bought using shell companies the proportion was even greater in los angeles and manhattan

of russian interference in the 2016 presidential election the state department concerned about deripaska s connections to russian organized crime which he has denied has restricted his travel to the united states for years such fears have not stood in the way of his these denizens all of whom denied wrongdoing made their high priced purchases in what has become a common way nationwide nearly half of homes worth at least 5 million thefound were bought using shell companies the proportion was even greater in los angeles and manhattan where more than 80 percent of time warner center sales fit that description as the treasury department put it in 2017 nearly one in three high end real estate purchases that it monitors involves an individual whom the government has been tracking as suspicious yet somehow the presence of so many shady buyers has never especially troubled the real estate industry or for that matter politicians in 2013 new york city s then mayor michael bloomberg asked wouldn t it be great if we could get all the russian billionaires to move here the warm welcome has created a strange dissonance in american policy take the case of the aluminum magnate oleg

east side and another estate near washington s embassy row over time the gap between the noble intentions of the patriot act and the dirty reality of the property market became too wide to ignore in 2016 in 2017 act and the dirty reality of the property market became too wide to ignore in 2016 barack obama s administration tested a program to bring the real estate industry in line with the banks compelling brokers to report foreign buyers too the ongoing program piloted in miami and manhattan could have become the scaffolding for a truly robust enforcement regime but then the american presidency turned over and a landlord came to power obama s successor liked selling condos to anonymous foreign buyers and may have grown dependent on their cash in 2017 reuters examined the sale of trump organization properties in florida it found that 77 of 2 044 units in the developments were owned by russians but that was likely an incomplete portrait more than one third of the units had been sold to corporate vehicles which can readily hide the identity of the true owner as oliver bullough remarks they might have belonged to vladimir putin for all anyone else could know around the time that trump took up occupancy in the white house the patriot act s temporary exemption for real estate entered its 15th year without anyone ever declaring it so the ephemeral has been enshrined act s temporary exemption for real estate entered its 15th year without anyone ever declaring it so the ephemeral has been enshrined the war on kleptocracy had meanwhile been lurching forward on another front if foreign plutocrats remained mostly unscathed as they made themselves at home in the u s american plutocrats eager to hide their fortunes abroad faced fresh trouble in 2007 the united states experienced one of its bouts of moral clarity jolted by the confessions of a banker named bradley birkenfeld who came clean to the department of justice he would later tell his story in a book called lucifer s banker what he freely divulged to prosecutors were his client recruiting efforts on behalf of ubs the swiss banking behemoth the scale of the hidden cash spun congress into a fury in 2010 it passed the foreign account tax compliance act birkenfeld described how he had ensconced himself in the gilded heart of the american plutocracy attending yacht regattas and patronizing art galleries he would mingle with the wealthy and strike up conversation what i can do for you is zero he would say and then pause before the punch line actually it s three zeroes zero income tax zero capital gains tax and zero inheritance tax birkenfeld s unsubtle approach succeeded wildly as did his bank as part of an agreement with the justice department ubs admitted to hiding assets totaling some 20 billion in american money the scale of the hidden cash spun congress into a fury in 2010 it passed the foreign account tax compliance act fatca legislation with moral clout that belies its stodgy name never

to one powerful strain of american exceptionalism the nation boasts superior financial hygiene and a bedrock culture of good government indeed the u s government has devoted more attention to money laundering than perhaps any other nation on the planet but the bar isn t very high and the vigilance has its limits in 2011 the obama administration sought to collect more information about foreigners bank accounts and to share it with the relevant home countries but banks along with their lobbyists and intellectual mouthpieces worked furiously to prevent the expansion a fellow at the heritage

this is the wrong issue bankers associations in texas california and new york followed suit the effort went nowhere in congress members of america s professional elite competed to sell their services

retrieve money laundered within its borders in fact it has grown into the biggest tax haven in the world the firm said these statements were removed before the presentation was delivered because they did not reflect the firm s real views not long before the u s declined to sign on to the oecd standards a branch office of the baronial rothschild bank opened on the 12th floor of a building in reno nevada far away in miles and spirit from the home office in paris the bank s name wasn t announced on the exterior of the building or even listed in the lobby directory soon after the reno outpost opened one of the bank s managing directors introduced the new branch s services to potential clients in san francisco what made the presentation so memorable were the ideas included in a draft procured by the script laid bare the reasons for wealthy foreigners to funnel money through nevada the state is the ideal place to hide money from governments and avoid paying u s taxes the draft acknowledged a truth that bankers don t usually admit in public which is that the united states has little appetite for helping foreign governments retrieve money laundered within its borders in fact it has grown into the biggest tax haven in the world the firm said these statements were removed before the presentation was delivered because they did not reflect the firm s real views what changed wasn t just regulatory structure the behavior of the american elite changed too members of the professional classes competed to sell their services to kleptocrats in the course of that competition they breezed past old ethical prohibitions and the pressure rose to test the limits of the law a collection of videos on the internet filmed in 2014 illustrates this moral collapse the clips never show the face of a man introduced as ralph kayser a german who reveals only the most elemental details about himself recited in lightly accented english he has lined up a succession of meetings with 13 law firms in manhattan in which he engages in pleasantries and then announces his purpose he works as an adviser to a government official in one of these mineral rich countries in west africa he explains over a long career the official has grown quite wealthy companies are eager to get hold of rare earth or other minerals and so they pay some special money for it i wouldn t name it bribe i would say facilitation money that is entirely by design kayser is actually a character devised by global witness the london based ngo the actor is outfitted with a well concealed camera to capture the american lawyers displaying their ethical proclivities although none of the lawyers kayser visits takes him on as a client and several say they need more information about the source of the official s wealth only one flatly refuses to discuss ways to move the money kayser has not it should be said selected the law offices of saul goodman his targets include attorneys at white shoe firms of course they understand the risks of moving suspect cash into new york one lawyer tells kayser i ve gotta be very careful myself i don t wanna do something looks like i m laundering money and that would cost me my license and and i just don t do that just what sort of scrutiny he generally applies though isn t clear when i get money from my other clients he admits it always comes in with some strange name on it i don t even ask another lawyer blithely announces they don t send lawyers to jail because we run the country we re still members of a privileged class in this country the perils of corruption were an obsession of the founders madison mentioned corruption 54 times in a 1787 notebook global witness conducted its experiment to point out big law s complicity in the spread of kleptocracy but the footage also provides primary anthropology of an american elite a profession like law has highly developed ethical codes yet those codes appear to have receded in recent years even the most prestigious firms find themselves fretful about the survival of their high priced business model which was profoundly rattled by the 2008 financial crisis and the corporate cost cutting that followed greedy impulses have surely always existed within the white shoe world but the sense of darwinian struggle and the norms of a global elite have eroded boundaries the same partners who shed underachieving colleagues more ruthlessly than they used to also seem primed to adopt a more permissive attitude toward clients whom they might once have rejected this decay has been on full display in robert mueller s investigation we have seen how the firm skadden arps slate meagher flom a sturdy pillar of the legal profession placed itself in the service of kleptocracy one partner at the firm from 2010 to 2018 gregory craig had served as barack obama s white house counsel the man responsible for safeguarding the integrity of the presidency at skadden he oversaw the creation of a report that was used to justify ukrainian president viktor yanukovych s arrest of his primary political opponent on what were widely viewed as highly dubious grounds the firm according to testimony in mueller s investigation said privately that evidence to support the arrest was kayser s client he continues is getting older and because the client s wife has always wanted a new york brownstone and the client is in the market for a gulfstream and a yacht he has a sudden need to transport money into the united states the client prefers that his purchases remain a tightly held secret so as not to provoke attention back in his home country it would look at least very very embarrassing kayser makes hardly any effort to disguise his desire to move suspect funds that is entirely by design kayser is actually a character devised by global witness the london based ngo the actor is outfitted with a well concealed camera to capture the american lawyers displaying their ethical proclivities although none of the lawyers kayser visits takes him on as a client and several say they need more information about the source of the official s wealth only one flatly refuses to discuss ways to move

creation of a report that was used to justify ukrainian president viktor yanukovych s arrest of his primary political opponent on what were widely viewed as highly dubious grounds the firm according to testimony in mueller s investigation said privately that evidence to support the arrest was virtually nonexistent another lawyer who worked for skadden has pleaded guilty to lying to prosecutors during the mueller team s probe of the firm s ukrainian work the ukrainians hired skadden through a middleman the now jailed political consultant paul manafort once upon a time it might have been possible to think of manafort as a grubby outlier in washington the lobbyist with the lowest standards willing to take on the most egregious clients but mueller has exposed just how tightly tethered manafort s work on behalf of ukrainian kleptocrats was to washington s permanent elite manafort subcontracted some of his lobbying to the firm of tony podesta arguably the most powerful democratic influence peddler of his generation and manafort employed mercury public affairs where he dealt with vin weber a former republican congressman and a former chairman of the national endowment for democracy america s fear of kleptocracy goes back to its founding in 1785 benjamin franklin returned from paris where he had served as a representative of american interests he brought home a bejeweled gift which incited controversy the grandest item in his possession it was a portrait of louis xvi outlined by 408 diamonds and stored in a golden case this present was often referred to as a snuffbox a name that seemed intended to obscure its grandeur it symbolized everything that franklin s generation despised about europe and its debasements there gift giving was a standard diplomatic custom but a gift might cloud the judgment of a public official and risked undermining the allegiances of the recipient it represented the possible elevation of personal gain over commitment to the public good the perils of corruption were an obsession of the founders in the summer of 1787 james madison mentioned corruption in his notebook 54 times to read the transcripts of the various constitutional conventions is to see just how much that generation worried about the moral quality of public behavior and how much it wanted to create a system that defined corruption more expansively than the french or british systems had and that fostered a political culture with higher ethical ambitions in her important history corruption in america zephyr teachout a legal scholar and liberal activist argues that during the country s first 200 years courts maintained the founders vigilance against corruption for a good chunk of american history a number of states criminalized lobbying in many forms out of a sense that a loosening of standards would trigger a race to the bottom that near phobia now looks quaint and also prescient the political culture the legal culture the banking culture so much of the culture of the self congratulatory meritocratic elite have long since abandoned such prudish ways the defining document of our era is the supreme court s citizens united decision in 2010 the ruling didn t just legalize anonymous expenditures on political campaigns it redefined our very idea of what constitutes corruption limiting it to its most blatant forms the bribe and the explicit quid pro quo justice anthony kennedy s majority opinion crystallized an ever more prevalent ethos of indifference the collective shrug in response to tax avoidance by the rich and by large corporations the yawn that now greets the millions in dark money spent by invisible billionaires to influence elections

management may only address questions of a material nature from the investment community in a public forum so please ask all such questions during this call we are also live tweeting today s earnings call you can follow us on twitter using our handle ab_insights now i ll turn it over to seth seth p bernstein president and chief executive officer good morning thank you for joining us today despite the impact of year end market dislocation on both industry flows and assets we maintained strong underlying momentum across our business in 2018 and further strengthened our competitive position our full year results reflects the differentiation of our revitalized active equity platform which attracted 10 8 billion in net new flows and our ability to continue scaling and commercializing our business our sales mix across channels was our most diverse in years and finally our results reflect our ongoing commitment to disciplined expense management as demonstrated by the 140 basis point expansion in our adjusted operating margin in 2018 to 29 1 now let s get into the specifics starting with a firmwide overview on slide three annual gross sales of 93 8 billion in 2018 were up 15 billion or 19 about 10 billion of the increase came from first quarter crs fundings the rest was from robust client activity particularly in active equities total firmwide net flows were negative 8 1 billion for the year we experienced two large crs redemption totaling 14 billion in the first half and significant annual outflows from both institutional and retail fixed income products because of these net outflows and the steep fourth quarter market decline we finished 2018 with lower assets under management however average aum was up due to our first three quarters of strong market performance we also reported january 2019 aum this morning we were pleased to see the markets rebound during the month and a return to positive net flows in our retail and private wealth channels so these were eclipsed by outflows from institutions which resulted in total firm net outflows for the month slide four shows our quarterly flow trend by channel the left side chart show the outsized impact of lumpy crs sales and redemptions on firmwide institutional flows in the first half of the year on the right you can see the spike in fourth quarter retail redemptions due to the market correction in private wealth fourth quarter outflows were caused by several one off factors including year end tax related trading slide five is our annual flows view again the left side chart shows the net effect of this year s lumpy crs activity predominantly in our institutional channel net outflows totaled 10 billion from institutions and 8 billion overall the right side of chart tells a more positive story despite the fourth quarter rev in the markets our retail net flows were essentially flat in 2018 and our private wealth net flows were positive for the third consecutive year now let s turn to investment performance beginning on slide six clearly our near term fixed income performance has been challenged given our broad portfolio exposure to emerging market debt we were hard hit by the sustained downturn there we ve also had difficulty in recovering from some early duration calls and experienced some negative currency impact as well however our three year and five year track records remain quite strong with 90 and 89 of assets outperforming respectively in equities our investment performance bounced back in the fourth quarter as large strategies like strategic equities and large cap growth returns to outperformance our percentage of outperforming active equity strategies increased for every time period to 71 for the one year 62 for the three year and 83 for the five year slide seven and eight provide more insight on retail fixed income and equity investment performance the fixed income table on slide seven reflects the impact of our emerging market exposure on one year fund performance em debt and high yield were most affected though long term track records remain in top two quartiles our income portfolios are holding up well european income is top half for one year top quartile for the three year and top decile for the five year mortgage income remains at first percentile for the one year and increased sequentially to 13 for the three year and ab income remains top decile for three year and five year periods in equities on slide eight our emerging market concentrated international growth and international value equities funds continued to underperform yet every other fund on this slide ranks in the top two quartiles across all time periods these include concentrated global global low vol global core and large cap growth which are all top quartile solid long term track records like these were a major driver of our outstanding 2018 active equity flows let s move on to our client channels beginning with retail on slide nine we continue to invest in reshaping the firm s retail product offerings to better serve our clients our business is stronger and more diversified and we have become more adept of both anticipate client needs and innovating in a timely basis to meet them the cumulative effect of this methodical long term strategy is evident in our 2018 retail business mix and results the top left chart shows our success in reducing our dependence on volatile asia ex japan fixed income market we ve taken our share of fixed income gross sales from three quarters of total global sales two years ago to 41 today in asia ex japan fixed income has gone from 89 of gross sales in 2016 to 53 our positive mix shift is clear from the bottom left chart of the 25 funds that attracted net flows of 100 million or more in 2018 19 of them were equity alternative or multi asset services and half of those funds have been launched relaunched or redesigned in the past decade we are particularly proud of how our combination of relevance and outperformance in active equities has attracted inflows our full year retail active equity gross sales of 25 billion were up 72 and our active equity net flows increased to 8 billion from 2 8 billion that s in a year where total outflows in us active equity mutual funds increased by 33 to nearly 260 billion and we keep innovating for clients today we have partnerships with 13 distributors for our various flexfee funds which have total aum of 145 million excluding seed capital momentum continues to build as we educate the marketplace about this new mutual fund pricing structure now i ll talk about institutional on slide 10 here as in retail we re experiencing the benefits today of the years spent both rebuilding our active equity franchise and diversifying it in the most promising long term growth areas the top left chart shows our active equity gross sales of 7 3 billion more than doubled in 2018 they were our highest in a decade and our active equity net flows of 4 billion were positive for the first time since 2007 this represents a 13 organic growth rate against the steep industry wide contraction the revenue associated with our gross sales was up 54 reflecting our mix shift toward higher fee active equities alternatives and multi asset services these services represented 85 of our 9 7 billion year end pipeline this bodes well for our future revenues and fee rate in fact 2 2 billion or 60 of our new pipeline adds in the fourth quarter alone were in active equity strategies the balance included alternative and multi asset like commercial real estate debt custom alternative solutions and multi manager fund of funds as a result our pipeline annualized fee base exceeded 30 million for the fifth consecutive quarter moving to private wealth on slide 11 gross sales of 11 7 billion were our highest in 10 years and that s excluding inflows from our very successful first half option advantage launch as i mentioned earlier net flows were positive for the third consecutive year despite the fourth quarter spike in net outflows we added 2 4 billion in commitments to our suite of alternatives and focused equity services bringing the total to 9 1 billion at year end that s the bottom left chart we launched a new bdc for qualified private clients and we re in the process of partnering with abbott capital a leader in private equity investing to add a fund of funds offering as we expand our higher net worth client base advisor productivity is rising advisor productivity has grown at a 7 compound annual rate in years since we began offering alts and focused equity services and our average relationship size has increased by 6 just in the last year what s more after two years of flat to negative headcount growth we increased our advisor base by 6 in 2018 and we ll keep growing with spring 2019 opening of our 19th us private wealth office in nashville an exciting next step for ab i ll finish our business overview with the sell side on slide 12 in a year when this industry face one of its most disruptive events ever with the mifid ii transition and commissions continuing to decline i m impressed by our resilience bernstein research revenues were down just 2 in 2018 fourth quarter revenues increased 11 sequentially thanks to both the spike in us volume and volatility shown on the bottom left chart and robust year end research payments as i ve said many times now more than ever sell side research providers must deliver a differentiated offering to stay on clients lists that s our goal in acquiring autonomous research autonomous adds a preeminent research franchise in financial services in fintech to our platform areas where we ve historically been underrepresented it s a step change for us in both the us and europe in terms of analysts and stocks under coverage and a huge category by market cap it also allows us to focus resources on new analyst hires in other promising areas around the world in the fourth quarter alone we hired six new analysts in the us europe and india where we are building our mumbai office research excellence is our firm s brand and we re focused on successfully navigating this next phase of the evolution of this business i ll close by highlighting some of our 2018 accomplishments on slide 13 2018 was a year of progress for ab in every part of our long term growth strategy we continue to deliver for clients with our diverse products we further scaled and commercialized our offering set with particular momentum in active equities and we stay vigilant on expenses making our seventh straight year of margin expansion we re proud of these accomplishments and well aware of the challenges we face going forward coming into 2019 our asset base is lower and the revenue outlook is uncertain at the same time we have the right strategy business mix talent and global footprint to continue delivering for our clients which is our primary goal in any market environment now i ll turn it over to john to review our financials john c weisenseel chief financial officer thank you seth let s start with the gaap income statement on slide 15 fourth quarter gaap net revenues of 804 million decreased 13 from the prior year period operating income of 199 million decreased 30 and a 25 operating margin decreased by 490 basis points gaap epu of 0 63 comparison 0 84 in the fourth quarter of 2017 as always i ll focus our remarks from here on our adjusted results which remove the effect of certain items that are not considered part of our core operating business we base our distribution to unitholders upon our adjusted results which we provide in addition to and not as substitutes for our gaap results our standard gaap reporting our reconciliation of gaap to adjusted results are in our presentations appendix press release and 10 k our adjusted financial highlights are included on slide 16 fourth quarter revenues of 696 million operating income of 204 million and our margin of 29 3 all decreased year on year we earned and will distribute to our unitholders 0 64 per unit compared to 0 84 for last year s fourth quarter lower base and performance fees as well as seed investment losses primarily drove the weaker results for the year revenues increased 213 million to 2 9 billion operating income increased by 102 million to 852 million and operating margin increased by 140 basis points to 29 1 adjusted epu increased to 2 67 from the prior year s 2 30 higher base and performance fees drove the increase in revenues and diligent expense management drove our continued margin expansion we delve into these items in more detail on our adjusted income statement on slide 17 beginning with revenues net revenues decreased 10 for the fourth quarter but increased 8 for the full year versus the same prior year periods base fees for the fourth quarter decreased 3 due to lower average aum in the retail and institutional distribution channels but increased 7 for the full year due to higher average aum across all three distribution channels for the full year total average aum increased 5 1 and the portfolio fee rate increased 1 4 fourth quarter performance fees of 35 million compared to 80 million in the same prior year period our securitized assets strategy generated 23 million of performance fees in the fourth quarter 2017 compared to none in 2018 our middle market lending and us concentrated growth strategies generated lower performance fees in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the same prior year period for the year performance fees increased by 91 million to 196 million real estate equity fund i generated 91 million in performance fees in 2018 it is in the process of liquidation in addition the liquidation of financial services opportunity fund i was completed in 2018 and produced 36 million in additional performance fees compared to the prior year fourth quarter and full year revenues for bernstein research services decreased 3 and 2 respectively for the same prior year period due to the delay in revenue recognition resulting from the unbundling of research payments from trading commissions and a shift to lower fee electronic trading the impact of foreign exchange translation also contributed to the fourth quarter decline but partially offset the revenue decline for the full year period fourth quarter and full year investment losses include a 6 million realized loss on the sale of a seed capital investment in a private equity fund to which we approximately we received approximately 30 million in cash proceeds from the sale we liquidated this investments since it no longer met our product development objectives for our clients fourth quarter and full year other revenues increased 26 and 27 respectively as a result of higher dividends and interest earned on our broker dealer investments interest expense increased 8 million for the fourth quarter and 27 million for the full year as a result of higher interest paid on broker dealer customer balances because of the higher interest rates moving to adjusted expenses all in our total fourth quarter operating expenses of 492 million decreased 2 full year operating expenses of approximately 2 1 billion increased 6 from the prior year total compensation and benefits expense decreased 2 in the fourth quarter driven by lower incentive compensation but increased 9 for the full year due to higher incentive compensation base compensation commissions fringe and other employment costs all higher in both the fourth quarter and full year periods compared to the prior year compensation was 45 2 of adjusted net revenues for the fourth quarter versus 42 in the prior year period the full year 2018 comp ratio was 47 5 up 40 basis points from the prior year of the 40 basis point increase 30 basis points is attributed to employee transition costs relating to the nashville relocation the 40 basis point increase in full year increased full year epu by 0 03 and lowered the full year operating margin by 40 basis points going forward we expect to continue to manage to a comp ratio that will not exceed 50 in any given year given current market conditions we plan to accrue compensation at a 49 5 ratio in the first quarter 2019 with the option to adjust accordingly throughout the year if market conditions change fourth quarter and full year promotion and servicing increased 6 and 4 respectively versus the same prior year periods due primarily to higher marketing expenses resulting from retail advertising campaigns in asia europe and the united states for the full year increased trade execution and transfer fees were partially offset by a decline in t e g a expenses decreased 4 both in the fourth quarter and the full year versus the same prior year periods due to lower errors portfolio servicing fees occupancy and more favorable foreign exchange translation which was partially offset by higher professional fees and technology expenses the third quarter 2017 included net nonrecurring charges of 15 million the net of the 20 million outsourcing termination charge and a 5 million asia vat refund credit fourth quarter operating income of 204 million decreased 25 versus the same period of the prior year of the 25 decline 8 is attributed to the higher comp ratio in the fourth quarter of 2018 although the 2018 full year comp ratio is only 40 basis points higher than the prior year the fourth quarter 2018 comp ratio was 320 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of the prior year when a larger full year true up resulted in a much lower comp ratio for the quarter full year 2018 operating income of 852 million increased 14 from the prior year as revenue growth outpaced expense growth the incremental margin for the full year 2018 was 48 fourth quarter operating margin of 29 3 was down 590 basis points year on year of which 320 basis points is attributed to the higher comp ratio discussed earlier our full year 2018 operating margin of 29 1 was up 140 basis points from 2017 and represents our seventh consecutive year of margin expansion and our highest in 10 years these outstanding results demonstrate our continued diligent focus on expense management and the operating leverage of our business you may have noticed that our fourth quarter adjusted operating income was 5 million higher than our gaap operating income we excluded five items from our adjusted results that are not part of our core business operations first we recorded a 1 million non cash real estate charge for gaap reporting to true up our sublease assumptions relating to a prior period real estate write offs second we recorded a 3 million gaap p l credit to reduce the contingent payment liability related to a previous acquisition third we excluded 2 million of acquisition related expenses fourth we recorded a 3 million reduction in the fair value of our investment in a third party provider of financial market data and trading tools finally we deconsolidated certain seed investments in our adjusted results that we consolidated for our gaap reporting consolidating these investments decreased operating income by 2 million but did not affect net income or epu for the year adjusted operating income was 852 million was 27 million higher than our gaap operating income here we excluded six items of note 22 million in consolidated variable interest entities operating income 3 million long term compensation mark to market losses 7 million in real estate charges 2 million in acquisition costs 2 million contingent payment p l credits and a 4 million writedown in our investment in a third party provider of financial market data and trading tools in addition 35 million of performance fees earned on real estate equity fund i are included in our adjusted operating income but are excluded from gaap operating income since they are recorded as an increase to partner s capital in the opening balance sheet at the start of 2018 as per the implementation rules for the new revenue recognition standard these non gaap adjustments are outlined in the appendix of this presentation the full year 2018 effective tax rate for alliancebernstein lp was 5 6 about as expected going forward we expect the effective tax rate to remain around this level based upon our current forecasted mix of domestic versus foreign pre tax earnings i ll finish with an update on our planned corporate headquarters relocation to nashville our relocation is going very well and proceeding faster than we originally expected we re in the process of securing additional temporary office space which will facilitate the acceleration of our relocation so that the majority of the positions in scope will be relocated to nashville prior to the completion of our new permanent office buildings currently scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2020 we incurred 10 million of net transition costs in 2018 as expected nearly all are employee related and are included in the comp ratio calculation and the compensation accrual of the 10 million full year transition costs approximately 5 million was recorded in the fourth quarter as a result of the acceleration we now anticipate both higher transition cost and higher expense savings related to the nashville relocation we currently estimate that we will incur a total transition cost of approximately 155 million to 165 million for the period 2018 through 2024 when our new york city building lease expires these costs include employee relocation severance recruitment and overlapping compensation and occupancy costs over the same period we expect to realize total expense savings of about 190 million to 200 million which exceed the total transition costs however we will incur transition costs prior to the realization of expense savings we currently anticipate that the largest reduction in epu during the transition period could be approximately 0 07 in 2019 about 0 03 above the amount incurred in 2018 we still expect to achieve breakeven or possibly a slight increase in epu by 2021 and then epu accretion for each year thereafter beginning in 2025 once the transition period has been completed we estimate ongoing annual expense savings of approximately 70 million to 75 million through results of a combination of occupancy compensation fringe benefit and consulting relating savings our estimates for both the transition costs and the corresponding expense savings are based upon our best current assumptions of employee relocation costs severance recruitment overlapping compensation and occupancy costs our estimates for both the timing of incurring the transition cost and realizing the related expense savings are based upon our current relocation implementation plan and the timing for the execution of each phase the actual total charges eventually recorded and the related expense savings realized and the timing of the epu impact are likely to differ from our current estimates as we implement each phase of our headquarters relocation and with that seth jim and i are pleased to answer your questions questions and answers operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of michael carrier from bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead sean colman bank of america merrill lynch analyst good morning guys this is actually sean colman on for mike just a couple of questions on flows can you guys discuss your thoughts on what drove the elevated fixed income outflows in the quarter do you guys believe it was driven by the weaker short term performance or more just environmental factors and seasonality seth p bernstein president and chief executive officer let me take that i think it was more the environment than short term performance but and i say that principally because particularly in investment grade credit a lot of those flows outflows were a function unattractive fx hedging costs that a number of our offshore clients were experiencing rather than necessarily performance shortfalls in the in performance of investment grade on the other hand in our retail services which were global multi sectors such as global high yield and ab high income we do have an exposure to emerging markets and we did see underperformance there given our overweight earlier in the year which did cause us to underperform relative to some peers so i do think it was more accentuated by a broader environment that was more negative sean colman bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay thanks and then you guys have had really strong flows in equities and alternatives and a part of that is at a strong performance but even very strong performing peers you guys are doing better so we re just wondering if that s more of the product lineup or distribution mix that s driving this seth p bernstein president and chief executive officer well i think it made i think we have really spent a lot of time and effort creating a product suite that speaks to our clients we had 16 services equity services with net flows greater than 250 million last year and so i think that they were the services were meeting specific client needs additionally we have been as you know been investing and optimizing our us and emea sales forces and i believe there has been benefit from that as well sean colman bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of dan fannon from jefferies please go ahead daniel fannon jefferies analyst thanks good morning just looking into next year you highlighted assets that are starting at a lower point or i should say this year can you talk about non comp expense and kind of how you re thinking about the environment or budget for this year versus say previous periods john c weisenseel chief financial officer sure this is john actually i think we ve made a lot of great headway on keeping the non comp expenses under control they are actually down year over year for the full year when you look at the combined promotion and servicing and general g a expenses going forward our goal is to try to keep those the rate of increase of those both of those lines at around the rate of inflation daniel fannon jefferies analyst great and then for performance fees obviously very difficult to predict but just thinking about the setup for 2019 and if there any high water marks or how we should think about just generally the level versus kind of previous periods as you ve obviously been growing your alternative aum but just wanted to get a sense of how we should kind of think about the contribution in 2019 maybe versus previous periods or other things you could help us in terms of getting some level around that john c weisenseel chief financial officer sure in 2018 we were helps in the performance fees the over 195 million or so of performance fees we had about 130 million of those fees came from two funds that are currently in liquidation so real estate equity fund i we realized about 91 million of performance fees and then over 30 million came from financial services opportunity fund i and the liquidation of that fund was completed in 2018 real estate fund i is still out there but it s been mostly liquidated so we would just expect some minimal fees from that in 2019 so i think when you look at the 195 million you have to really take off the 130 million and then of course it s really a function of what s going to happen with the markets going forward the strategies are all varies some of them have high watermarks that you have to pass and then you get a certain percentage of the upside above that some others don t but again it s just varies strategy by strategy daniel fannon jefferies analyst okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of bill katz from citi please go ahead william katz citi analyst okay thank you very much for taking the question this good morning just wondered if you could still spend a little time on the institutional dynamics in your aum at least you sort of noted that you had outflows in institutional in january but yet your pipeline at the end of year was rather strong so still wondering if you could talk to maybe the interplay between what s sort of driving the nice pickup in the pipeline versus what was sort of seeing on a tactical basis in the month of january seth p bernstein president and chief executive officer bill in terms of january it s always i hate to even comment on a month to month basis but i think the dynamic was not unlike what we saw in 2018 in a sense that we had a couple of large fixed income outflows that really accounted for the bulk of what we saw in january outside of that the trends were quite similar and to your point the level of activity that we re seeing be it in equities alternatives continues to be quite strong the and what s encouraging i think when you look both at what s been coming into our institutional business over the course of say with the last three quarters of the year where the fee rate was nearly twice what our overall average fee rate was in the book overall and then you look at the pipeline and the average fee rate is well above 2 times our existing book i mean that s a very encouraging trend when you think about both the breadth of activity the type of support that we re getting from consultants and the average fee rate it s all positive william katz citi analyst okay that s very helpful thank you and then you had mentioned in the in the private clients a new sort of fund to fund opportunity just sort of wondering how quickly that gets launched and what kind of scalability you could foresee as you look out over the next one to two years maybe back half of this year and 2020 seth p bernstein president and chief executive officer bill it s seth we are working with abbott capital to do a private equity fund of funds vehicle abbott s focus is on middle market which fits nicely with our focus of our middle market lending business both of which we target capacity for our private fund client group i think it s too early for us to forecast what we think the take up will beat because we haven t sold this sort of service before so i would refrain from guessing but we re hopeful that this will resonate with our clients james a gingrich chief operating officer and bill i would just see it as again one more step in a continuing evolution of how we re positioning our private wealth business as we target a higher net worth client and maybe that we ve served historically and it s going to be if you look at how we have progressed in terms of the development of our alternatives and focused equity services in that business it s just another brick in the wall william katz citi analyst okay inaudible so as you think about your commentary that you re running a little bit ahead of time in terms of the pacing of the cost saves associated with the relocation and sort of putting aside the elevated upfront transition cost could you give us an update on sort of what are you thinking about in terms of the long range margin opportunity and obviously you re bumping up already close to that 30 near term target how should we think of maybe long term once you get through some of these cost savings i m just assuming reasonably benign markets i know it s a big assumption john c weisenseel chief financial officer let me get that it s john so as we ve talked about that we expect to turn breakeven or slightly positive in 2021 and from that period the savings continue to build each year but it s not until you get to 2025 when the transition period ends at that point we re looking at basically expense savings in 70 million to 75 million a year so i think you can just take that number and there you will see the impact on the margin from that william katz citi analyst okay all right thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from robert lee kbw your line is open robert lee kbw analyst great thanks good morning thanks for taking my question i guess my first question would be in the private wealth management i know there is a 6 increase in the number of advisors and i must think maybe the highest biggest increase in the number of years so as maybe just i m assuming maybe that was just a larger recruiting class you maybe talk a little bit about what s driving that and kind of how you see that progressing and how you re kind of thinking of that for the new advisors hitting kind of the run rate reduction seth p bernstein president and chief executive officer sure we have as jim was saying as we revised the suite products services that we offer our private clients we are beginning to see greater productivity out of the advisors i think the advisors productivity was up 7 year over year and so we also thought it was as we are beginning to gain more and more confidence in our ability to penetrate in higher income brackets we thought that we should be growing the advisor force carefully and so we ve been increasing the size of our incoming classes and we ve dedicated personnel to accomplish that and we re beginning to see we ve seen very good classes who are diversed engaged and they re taking their seats in our offices around the country so we want to continue growing it carefully part of that is finding the right people and i think that s really all i can say in that regard robert lee kbw analyst okay thank you and as a follow on i know it s still very early days for the fulcrum fee and it seems like you ve had some success adding up new distributors and some early sales it is any sense that in those channels when you start to sell them products that it s being additive to overall gross sales versus maybe cannibalizing existing sales how are you maybe it s too early to tell but what s your experience so far seth p bernstein president and chief executive officer we are pleased with the progress i think we ve said all along this was going to take an awfully long time because in part we were appealing to slightly different segments of the marketplace so i think it s too early to determine whether it s cannibalization i don t think so because this is appealing to people with model portfolios and others i think it s important to recognize that most of our clients have at least in their non ira portfolios a lot of taxable gains that they don t want to recognize so i don t think this is really arising from people moving out of existing but we think it s been additive and but we think the process is a slow one and we just want to manage people s expectations around it but the take up from distributors has been very reassuring robert lee kbw analyst hey great but maybe one last one i mean you ve talked about and clearly you ve had a positive mix shift with new sales in pipelines into higher fee strategies if we were to look at 2018 fourth quarter and maybe even with the first quarter do you have a sense or a number you maybe could share what the new organic revenue growth would have looked like relative to kind of just a flow picture john c weisenseel chief financial officer well again i in terms of the year let me answer it in terms of the year i think the arithmetic is pretty straightforward fee rate grew 1 and then you can look at what the aum change is year on year and that s really the sum of those two that s going to be over time our organic revenue growth rate robert lee kbw analyst okay thanks for taking my question operator thank you our next question comes from alex blostein from goldman sachs your line is open alex blostein goldman sachs analyst on the research business can you talk about the pipeline that you re seeing specifically outside the us in us and europe and what sort of how do you plan to expand the number of stocks that are being covered and add additional resource in that business seth p bernstein president and chief executive officer we are seeing a pipeline outside the us that s similar to what we re seeing in the us in terms of improved mix i think that s what you re asking john c weisenseel chief financial officer yes could you repeat the question because you just alex blostein goldman sachs analyst yes sure we just wanted to get a sense of the pipeline and the outside the us and how many more analysts that you plan to add going forward in 2019 and extend the coverage seth p bernstein president and chief executive officer well i the there the businesses is as we note we re in the process of adding analysts around the world both us as well as as you mentioned in europe and in asia those asian hires are going to be in both hong kong singapore and india the i think that that is just a continual process of that business to continue to build out the overall headcount alex blostein goldman sachs analyst understand okay and last one any technological improvements or investments that you are planning going forward like and are you trying to build in in house or are you trying to outsource from a third parties just wanted to get a sense as to how you re thinking about it for this year and next year seth p bernstein president and chief executive officer see i think our if you re talking about our overall technology spend john c weisenseel chief financial officer sorry can you repeat the question alex blostein goldman sachs analyst yes sorry just wanted to check on what are the technological improvements or investments are you thinking for 2019 and 2020 and are you trying to build things like internally or trying to purchase it from like going for a third party outsourcing seth p bernstein president and chief executive officer i think that that we do all of the above we where it makes sense we will develop in house where it makes sense to use third party software we use third party software or similarly in terms of using onshore and offshore and nearshore resourcing the it is an ongoing strategy across all of our businesses to continue to digitize there s been a whole series of examples for example in our fixed income business the development of efforts like inaudible or in our us retail business the simon application there are a host of those types of examples of things going on our business where we are looking to work smarter and more efficiently in everything we do alex blostein goldman sachs analyst okay thank you operator operator instructions your next question comes from the line of will katz from citi please go ahead william katz citi analyst okay just a couple of follow ups actually one follow up on request on the follow up just as you think about january sort of curious of the behavior that you re seeing in terms of the snap back in january you talked about maybe on the retail private client side where the demand is by asset class and by geography seth p bernstein president and chief executive officer let me start and people may add in but with regard to january we reported aum this morning as you know of 538 billion that was up 4 2 that increase was due to market appreciation partially offset by total firmwide net outflows but by channel what we re really seeing is improved retail taxable fixed income flows and the outflows as i mentioned earlier were more institutional in nature and active equity remains in positive flow james a gingrich chief operating officer and you asked about geographically bill i say that in retail the trends have been positive globally so we ve seen good traction in asia ex japan we ve seen more positive or conservative situation in the us so that includes global high yield and american income william katz citi analyst okay just one request sort of appreciate all your disclosure to the extent you could further break out your costs associated with the relocation somewhere either in the press release or the supplement i think will help investors get to the core earnings power core margin improvement and it takes a little bit of work trying to get there thank you very much john c weisenseel chief financial officer thank you bill this is john so maybe i can give you a little bit more info there just with regards to 2019 so as i said we expect 2019 the impact to epu to be about 0 07 and that impact is going to be split between increased occupancy costs as well as increased costs on the headcount or human capital side and the human capital piece tends to flow up into the comp ratio so we expect the impact or the pressure of the comp ratio from the human capital piece to be about 40 basis points and i think of the total 0 07 yes i would say that probably maybe just around a third or slightly more than a third of that will flow through occupancy and the balance would be in that 40 basis points that would flow into the comp ratio for human capital cost william katz citi analyst okay that s really helpful thank you so much thanks for taking all the questions operator there are no further questions at this time i ll turn the call back over to management for closing remarks

it s looking as though a familiar dynamic is taking hold a fundamental search for yield in an environment that supports risk taking is seeing capital move out of safer assets in fixed income and cash markets and into higher yield equity markets boding well for global equity indices in the short to medium term 5 for now its fed before fundamentals market participants have proven their concern is first with the fed and financial conditions followed by fundamental concerns like earnings global growth and concomitant factors like the trade war and geopolitical ructions again that balance would shift in the event recession risk becomes too heightened while not an immediate problem now such a risk ought not to be waived away economic data is treading a fine line especially in europe and would indicate the world economy is on some sort of slippery slope china is in the same boat but unfortunately the opacity of their financial system and economy make it difficult to garner a credible view on the middle kingdom the us stands out as a beacon in the global economy presently and is willed by the bulls to maintain its currently solid growth outlook 6 inflation risk looking low one risk that doesn t appear too bothersome for traders in fact it may be a welcomed dynamic is that inflation in developed markets is apparently flatlining once again it was a theme of last night s trade market s received inflation data out of the u k and us economies prefacing the release of chinese cpi data today on balance cpi missed expectations in both the us and uk overnight presumably to the relief of central bankers who in the face of market volatility and growth concerns would loathe being pushed into hiking rates because of an inflation outbreak in response to the news traders maintained their position that global rates will stay low this year as the global economy wrangles with its current funk 7 european bond curves flattening greenback stands to benefit bond curves have flattened in the european region consequently bizarrely and this does not bode well for the euro and pound potentially markets are still pricing in some chance of a rate hike still from the bank of england or european central bank this year far be it to argue with the will and wisdom of the market but given brexit tensions and clear signs of cracks in the continent s economy the notion rates can move higher in this dynamic is fanciful the us dollar will be a barometer for european and probably global growth risks as well as the rate outlook for the boe and ecb although the greenback is still range bound here and now a desire for safety and higher yield should attract investors to treasuries and subsequently bolster the usd going forward 8 market watch spi futures up 7 points or 0 1 to 6025 at about 6 10am aedt aud 0 1 to 71 02 us cents nzd 1 1 to 68 10 us cents nzd 1 to 95 87 australian cents on wall st at 2 09pm dow 0 4 s p 500 0 3 nasdaq 0 3 in new york bhp 1 2 rio 1 3 atlassian 0 1 in europe stoxx 50 0 4 ftse 0 8 cac 0 4 dax 0 4 spot gold 0 1 to us1311 77 an ounce at 1 22pm new york time brent crude 1 9 to us63 60 a barrel us oil 1 9 to us54 10 a barrel iron ore 0 5 to us87 22 a tonne dalian iron ore 0 6 to 620 yuan lme aluminium flat at us1860 a tonne lme copper 0 3 to 6125 a tonne 2 year yield us 2 53 australia 1 73 5 year yield us 2 52 australia 1 78 10 year yield us 2 79 australia 2 15 germany 0 12 us australia 10 year yield gap as of 5 20am aedt 55 basis points this column was produced in commercial partnership between the sydney morning herald the age and ig
a scandinavian style social welfare state requires a massive tax hike on the middle class it can t be done simply by raising marginal tax rates on the wealthiest taxpayers to 70 percent as rep alexandria ocasio cortez suggests because few taxpayers pay the top rate red baiting appears to be a crucial part of president donald trump s reelection campaign he regularly accuses democrats of wanting to turn america into another venezuela in the state of the union address he went straight from denouncing the maduro regime to proclaiming here in the united states we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country on the present trajectory it won t be long before trump like a latter day richard nixon will be accusing sen kamala harris d calif of being pink right down to her underwear having emigrated to the united states as a small boy from the soviet union i am instinctively suspicious of socialism and inveterately opposed to communism but it is cretinous to conflate sen bernie sanders i vt and rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y with nicolás maduro they may all call themselves socialists but that s all they have in common trump s attack makes as much sense as suggesting that the democratic party is made up of kim jong un loyalists because the official name of north korea is the democratic people s republic of korea the free market economist friedrich hayek warned of this confusion in his book the road to serfdom socialism he noted may mean and is often used to describe merely the ideals of social justice greater equality and security which are the ultimate aims of socialism but it could also describe the means that some socialists used to achieve their objectives in this sense socialism means the abolition of private enterprise of private ownership of the means of production and the creation of a system of a planned economy in which the entrepreneur working for profit is replaced by a central planning body obviously sanders ocasio cortez represent the former strain of socialism and maduro the latter even if sanders has been foolish enough to praise venezuela in the past do you have something to say share your opinion by sending a letter to the editor email share your opinion by sending a letter to the editor email letters seattletimes com and please include your full name address and telephone number for verification only letters are limited to 200 words maduro and his predecessor hugo chávez grossly mismanaged the state oil company which accounts for almost all of venezuela s exports they expanded the government by gobbling up more than 500 private companies and they imposed controls on prices imports and foreign exchange when oil prices sank maduro piled up debts and printed money the result is hyperinflation 377 678 percent and counting and an economic free fall worse than the one the united states experienced during the great depression along the way chávez and maduro crushed the remnants of democracy rigging elections and locking up or killing political opponents this is one model of socialism the same approach that has been applied in cuba and the soviet union but there are many other varieties that are far more benign france has had socialist presidents on and off since the 1920s and it remains a free country socialists have ruled in many south american countries without ushering in disaster sanders himself cites the scandinavian model the achievement of denmark norway and sweden is indeed remarkable those countries are roughly as wealthy as the united states on a per capita basis but they have less income inequality and a stronger social safety net by some measures moreover they are freer economically and politically than the united states they show that a free market welfare state isn t an oxymoron so there is nothing sinister about wanting to emulate the scandinavian example but that doesn t necessarily mean it s practical the scandinavians have lower corporate tax rates than the united states but much higher individual taxes according to the tax foundation the top marginal tax rate of 60 percent in denmark applies to all income over 1 2 times the average income in denmark from the american perspective this means that all income over 60 000 1 2 times the average income of about 50 000 in the united states would be taxed at 60 percent the scandinavian countries also charge hefty value added taxes of 25 percent on consumption the united states doesn t have a national sales tax and the average rate for state sales taxes is only 7 percent in all scandinavians pay 25 488 a head in taxes compared with 14 793 a head in the united states 72 percent more this is what it takes to finance a scandinavian style social welfare state it can t be done simply by raising marginal tax rates on the wealthiest taxpayers to 70 percent as ocasio cortez suggests because few taxpayers pay the top rate it requires a massive tax hike on the middle class there is a good reason sanders and ocasio cortez aren t advocating this it s unpopular support for medicare for all plummets from 71 percent to 37 percent if people are told it will require most americans to pay more in taxes we are far more likely to do what we have done before and add new social welfare benefits with deficit spending that s not the scandinavian way in those countries government debt

which we also refer to as adjusted earnings per share or adjusted eps v ebitda and adjusted ebitda these measures are not recognized measurements under united states generally accepted accounting principles or gaap when analyzing our operating performance investors should use them in addition to and not as an alternative for their most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap because not all companies use identical calculations our presentation of these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies our management generally uses these non gaap financial measures to evaluate operating performance and for other discretionary purposes the company believes that these measures provide a more complete understanding of ongoing operations enhance comparability of current results to prior periods and may be useful for investors to analyze our financial performance because they eliminate the impact of selected charges that may obscure trends in the underlying performance of our business the company further uses certain of these measures and believes that they are useful to investors for purposes described below with respect to fee revenue and organic fee revenue the company believes that investors may find these measures useful to analyze the financial performance of our occupier outsourcing and property management business lines and our business generally fee revenue excludes costs reimbursable by clients and as such provides greater visibility into the underlying performance of our business organic fee revenue for the three months ended december 31 2018 further excludes contributions from all acquisitions completed after fourth quarter 2017 organic fee revenue for the twelve

fourth quarter 2017 for the three months ended december 31 2018 with respect to adjusted net income adjusted eps ebitda and adjusted ebitda the company believes that investors may find these measures useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because their calculations generally eliminate the accounting effects of acquisitions which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions and in the case of ebitda and adjusted ebitda the effects of financings and income tax and the accounting effects of capital spending all of these measures may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance in the case of ebitda and adjusted ebitda these measures are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for our management s discretionary use because they do not consider cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments the ebitda and adjusted ebitda measures calculated herein may also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our credit facilities and debt instruments which amounts are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non cash charges and are used by us to determine compliance with financial covenants therein and our ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments the company also uses adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps as significant components when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive compensation programs

executive summary wisconsin has struggled with its tax a tax is a mandatory payment or charge collected by local state and national governments from individuals or businesses to cover the costs of general government services goods and activities system for decades the state has always been marked by high property tax a property tax is primarily levied on immovable property like land and buildings as well as on tangible personal property that is movable like vehicles and equipment property taxes are the single largest source of state and local revenue in the u s and help fund schools roads police and other services burdens but in its effort to fix them has leaned on corporate and individual income tax an individual income tax or personal income tax is levied on the wages salaries investments or other forms of income an individual or household earns the u s imposes a progressive income tax where rates increase with income the federal income tax was established in 1913 with the ratification of the 16th amendment though barely 100 years old individual income taxes are the largest source of tax revenue in the u s es to a sizable degree as well wisconsinites are often flummoxed by why taxes are so high here government services have a good reputation but it isn t always clear they are worth the price tag still other taxpayers feel they should be grateful as at least fiscal matters aren t in as dire of straits as in illinois in recent legislative sessions the legislature and administration have made strides to improve the roughest edges of the state s tax system but comprehensive tax reform has not been at the top of the agenda we believe it ought to be over the last year our team of economists and tax experts at the tax foundation joined with wisconsin s own badger institute to investigate what can be done about the state s tax system over the course of 12 months our team met with over 100 stakeholders from all walks of wisconsin life including small business owners local government officials trade associations industry representatives state legislators accountants and tax attorneys and everyday taxpayers we also reviewed the history of the fiscal system previous tax reform studies and historical revenue and economic trends the result is this book which is meant to help wisconsin achieve the goal of true tax reform reform that benefits all taxpayers and sets the state on a competitive path in the region and in the nation it s meant to start the conversation about what wisconsin does well but also what it could do better by recognizing strengths diagnosing challenges and prescribing real workable solutions during our meetings across wisconsin several themes emerged individual income tax rates are high at 7 65 percent wisconsin s top individual income tax rate is among the highest nationally and regionally and taxpayers are aware this issue is especially acute in milwaukee where firms must compete for top professional talent with other states and taxes can influence relocation decisions corporate tax rates are high but are significantly abated by the manufacturing and agriculture credit mac this credit shields manufacturing and agriculture firms from much of the burden of the state s high tax rates but many industries do not have access to it and this unequal treatment discourages diversified investment in the badger state for many wisconsin taxpayers property tax burdens are a persistent political concern but attempts at fixes have been costly while property taxes are a local revenue stream the state government has tried all sorts of levers to ameliorate the property tax burden including reimbursing local governments for property tax credits providing property tax credits on state income tax returns and offering direct subsidies to local governments in the form of a shared revenue program wisconsin is a member of the streamlined sales tax a sales tax is levied on retail sales of goods and services and ideally should apply to all final consumption with few exemptions many governments exempt goods like groceries base broadening such as including groceries could keep rates lower a sales tax should exempt business to business transactions which when taxed cause tax pyramiding our conversations with wisconsinites from all walks of life were instrumental in our development of four comprehensive tax reform options tailored to the badger state s unique strengths and challenges informing every page of this book are the insights and perspectives we gained from those who interact with wisconsin s tax system on a daily basis with these valuable perspectives at the forefront of our minds we undertook this project as an independent national organization familiar with tax developments in many states with the view that tax systems should adhere to sound economic principles including simplicity transparency neutrality and stability positioning wisconsin for the future means creating a tax code that can grow with the state not hold it back a tax code better aligned with growth opportunity and job creation is in the interest of all wisconsinites while economic efficiency is only one lens through which to analyze a tax code it is an important one after all there are many ways to generate a dollar of tax revenue but some taxes are more harmful to the economy than others and should be mitigated wherever possible stay informed on the tax policies impacting you subscribe to get insights from our trusted experts delivered straight to your inbox subscribe major tax studies consistently find that taxes have a negative impact on economic growth and that this impact varies across tax types and structures among major tax types corporate income taxes tend to be the most harmful to economic growth since they penalize capital investment followed by individual income taxes which impact individuals labor and savings decisions property and consumption taxes are less harmful because ultimately it is production innovation and entrepreneurial risk taking that drive economic growth within each of these taxes moreover the decisions states make to carve out tax bases incentivize or penalize certain economic decisions or create or reduce complexity have an effect as well for example mullen and williams 1994 found that higher marginal tax rates reduce gross state product growth each of the four comprehensive tax reform options presented in the pages ahead tackles wisconsin s tax dilemmas through a slightly different angle but all four options present bold reforms and prioritize progress in key areas in which the state s economic wellbeing is most at stake we hope that this book and its recommendations will provide useful information and observations for policymakers journalists and citizens in the badger state as they evaluate the state s fiscal system we are thankful to the wisconsinites who spent time with us talking about wisconsin s taxes without their input this publication would have been far less rich and meaningful we are also grateful to the wisconsin department of revenue for providing data to assist in estimating the fiscal impact of our proposed reforms our objective we hope these solutions guide the tax reform conversation in wisconsin by providing a framework upon which legislators and citizens can make further decisions each option in the menu of choices we present is designed to ensure the state builds a tax system for a diversified economy and positions itself as a destination for investment entrepreneurs and talented individuals in the years ahead menu of tax reform options our menu of comprehensive tax reform options is designed to allow legislators and taxpayers to reimagine their tax system to build an economy for the long term each of these plans streamlines the tax system removes or consolidates duplicative provisions and positions wisconsin for long term growth they are designed with economic growth in mind consistent with the literature on the economic effects of different tax types and structures these plans are roughly revenue neutral but if policymakers desire a net tax reduction or increase rates can be dialed up or down accordingly option a would transform wisconsin s income tax into a streamlined simplified flat tax an income tax is referred to as a flat tax when all taxable income is subject to the same tax rate regardless of income level or assets balanced by modernizing and increasing the sales tax these changes would align the state s tax rates with competitor states resembling changes enacted in the past decade in indiana it includes a flat income tax rate of 4 82 percent a standard deduction the standard deduction reduces a taxpayer s taxable income by a set amount determined by the government it was nearly doubled for all classes of filers by the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act tcja as an incentive for taxpayers not to itemize deductions when filing their federal income taxes a repeal of the personal exemption a moderately broadened sales tax base the tax base is the total amount of income property assets consumption transactions or other economic activity subject to taxation by a tax authority a narrow tax base is non neutral and inefficient a broad tax base reduces tax administration costs and allows more revenue to be raised at lower rates a slightly lower corporate income tax a corporate income tax cit is levied by federal and state governments on business profits many companies are not subject to the cit because they are taxed as pass through businesses with income reportable under the individual income tax improvement in wisconsin s ranking on our state business tax climate index from 32nd to 12th option b would recraft wisconsin s tax system in a similar fashion to state level tax reforms in other states simplifying and reducing income and business taxes while broadening the sales tax to match today s economy it includes a consolidated income tax structure with rates of 4 5 and 6 8 percent at thresholds of 0 10 000 and 40 000 conformity with the generous new federal standard deduction a repeal of the personal exemption moderate sales tax base broadening base broadening is the expansion of the amount of economic activity subject to tax usually by eliminating exemptions exclusions deductions credits and other preferences narrow tax bases are non neutral favoring one product or industry over another and can undermine revenue stability a reduction in the corporate income tax rate to 4 6 percent improvement in wisconsin s ranking on our state business tax climate index from 32nd to 14th option c would set wisconsin apart as the only state in the region with no corporate income tax making the state stand out as one of the few with no taxes on investment and job creation income tax rates are consolidated and reduced while the sales tax is broadened at the current rate it includes a full repeal of the corporate income tax one of the biggest impediments to growth in the badger state large sales tax base broadening paired with a slightly higher sales tax rate of 5 2 percent a consolidated income tax structure with rates of 4 5 and 6 8 percent at thresholds of 0 10 000 and 40 000 conformity with the generous new federal standard deduction a repeal of the personal exemption substantial improvement in wisconsin s ranking on our state business tax climate index from 32nd to 6th option d simplifies and stabilizes wisconsin s existing tax system broadening bases and adopting growth friendly reforms while retaining progressivity reducing business taxes and keeping the current sales tax rate it includes a graduated individual income tax with rates of 4 5 and 7 5 percent at thresholds of 0 20 000 and 150 000 elimination of the marriage penalty a marriage penalty is when a household s overall tax bill increases due to a couple marrying and filing taxes jointly a marriage penalty typically occurs when two individuals with similar incomes marry this is true for both high and low income couples retention of the current law personal exemption moderate sales tax base broadening while maintaining the current 5 percent sales tax rate a reduction in the corporate income tax rate to 4 percent improvement in wisconsin s ranking on our state business tax climate index from 32nd to 14th improvements included in all options in addition to the specific changes listed above options a b c and d each include the following structural improvements to wisconsin s tax code designed to move to more neutral treatment of business and individual activities while improving the state s competitiveness in the region and nation individual income tax repeal the state s marriage penalty by doubling bracket widths for married couples and repealing the married couple credit repeal the itemized deductions credit as a more generous standard deduction available to all taxpayers in options a b and c will reduce dependency on this credit corporate income tax conform to the tcja s new full expensing full expensing allows businesses to immediately deduct the full cost of certain investments in new or improved technology equipment or buildings it alleviates a bias in the tax code and incentivizes companies to invest more which in the long run raises worker productivity boosts wages and creates more jobs repeal the 3 percent surcharge levied on top of the corporate income tax and instead fund the wisconsin economic development corporation wedc through the general fund conform with new federal standards for treatment of net operating losses nols under the tcja eliminate the throwback rule in the corporate income tax sales tax sales tax pursue sales tax base expansion as detailed above and in chapter 5 share revenues from local flow down of state base expansion between counties and municipalities use revenue from the new online sales tax supreme court ruling to help pay for

so much for the federal reserve killing the us dollar when fed chair jerome powell signaled last month that rate hikes probably won t happen anytime soon many experts thought that would hurt the dollar powell said the central bank needed to be patient and see what happens next for the us economy low interest rates usually go hand in hand with a weaker currency think of japan and the yen during its lost decades of negative rates deflation and a sluggish economy but the us dollar index has rallied 1 5 against other currencies after the fed s january 30 meeting that has taken many by surprise an increase of 1 5 may not sound like a lot but it s actually a fairly dramatic move in the usually sleepy world of currencies the dollar is now up slightly year to date blue chip us companies hurt by stronger greenback that could wind up being a problem for big us multinational companies market leaders that are the biggest components of the dow and s p 500 a stronger dollar eats into the value of their international sales dow components apple boeing caterpillar and 3m generate a significant amount of their sales from foreign markets those are stocks that almost every average investor probably has some exposure to through popular etfs or mutual funds in a 401 k account or ira a stronger dollar has already helped drag down growth at companies that have reported their fourth quarter earnings s p 500 companies with more than half of their sales coming from the us have posted earnings growth of 16 6 according to data from factset that compares to growth of just 8 4 for companies with more than half of their sales generated overseas the strong dollar is just one of the reasons why multinational profits have lagged economic weakness in europe the uk china japan and other international markets is to blame as well those two things are related if the us economy remains healthier than most other major developed and developing countries the dollar will likely rally further if that happens that could make the situation even worse for many of america s largest companies when they report first quarter earnings in april china slowdown makes dollar look more attractive several experts do think the dollar rally has legs left in it jameel ahmad global head of currency strategy and market research at fxtm a foreign exchange brokerage firm said in a report this week that investors have been attracted to the dollar because the us economy still looks to be in solid shape he added that those who are fatigued from yo yo trade headlines about the us and china are now starting to focus on the fact china s moderating economic conditions remain a major overhang for the global growth narrative in other words the dollar could keep rallying if china s growth slows further particularly if that winds up dragging down other emerging markets with it but if this sluggishness eventually hits the united states most experts expect it won t hurt america s economic growth all that much that s why the dollar may continue to be the cleanest dirty shirt it s not a question of people flocking to the dollar because they want to it s that the data from europe and china and elsewhere has just gotten markedly worse said boris schlossberg managing director of fx strategy at bk asset management

yves here this isn t the most inspired discussion of mmt but it does give an idea of where mainstream economists are the fact that mmt is now being treated as a topic of consideration means it is well beyond the first you ignore them stage by inês gonçalves raposo an affiliate fellow at bruegel who previously worked for the financial stability department of the bank of portugal originally published at bruegel an old debate is back with a kick the discussion around modern monetary theory first gained traction in the economic blogosphere around 2012 recent interventions in the us and uk political arenas rekindled the interest in the heterodox theory that is now seeping into mainstream debates it is february 2019 and modern monetary theory mmt a heterodox theory born in the late 1990s has made its way into mainstream discussions on the back of public support from political figures both in the united states and the united kingdom interest around mmt is now at its peak figure 1 and the economic blogosphere and econtwitter have been having heated discussions on the matter a few weeks ago we reviewed some of the opinions around mmt most of which tied with the debate on us debt in this post we gather the main points that have been raised over the past week what is not mmt most of the debate has been on understanding what mmt actually is in fact the basis for mmt started in the 1940s back then abba lerner coined the term functional finance the base premise from which mmt later drew was that under functional finance fiscal policy should be the main instrument used to stabilise the economy taxes and not central bank interest rates should be used to remove people s spending power and thus stave off inflation this was a view shared by some in the postwar period as randall wray one of the main authors of mmt explains wray also summed up mmt in 10 points two of which have been the main focus of contention finance should be functional to achieve the public purpose not sound to achieve some arbitrary balance between spending and revenues most importantly monetary and fiscal policy should be formulated to achieve full employment with price stability there is no chance of involuntary default so long as the state only promises to accept its currency in payment it could voluntarily repudiate its debt but this is rare and has not been done by any modern sovereign nation jo michell had something to say on what mmt is not michell debunks the claim that government deficits are necessary and good because without them the means to make settlement would not exist in our economy this claim is neither correct nor part of mmt i don t believe that any of the core mmt scholars would argue that deficits are required to ensure that there is sufficient money in circulation the macroeconomic reason for running a deficit is straightforward and has nothing to do with money the government should run a deficit when the desired saving of the private sector exceeds the sum of private investment expenditure and the surplus with the rest of the world this is not an insight of mmt it was stated by kalecki and keynes in the 1930s as josh barro clarifies though there is no magical money tree involved the government is not constrained by its ability to obtain dollars but the economy is constrained by real limits on productive capacity main lines of criticism inflation there is nothing new about this and there is no underlying theory as brad delong puts it mmt has a modest goal that can nevertheless go wrong should three implicit assumptions prove to be false the first one that the debt market is efficient the second that investors react quickly and that inflation will too should concerns over government sustainability become evident the third that investors will only borrow foolishly on a small scale jonathan portes criticised mmt for not accounting for the role of the private sector in determining the level of demand and inflation portes takes issue with the claim that deficits are necessary for growth money is ultimately a creation of government but that doesn t mean only government deficits determine the level of demand at any one time the actions and beliefs of the private sector matter as well and that in turn means you can have budget surpluses and excess demand at the same time just as you can have budget deficits and deficient demand in his post portes describes mmt as the reversal of the traditional management of macroeconomy through interest rates aka the consensus agreement alexander douglas argues that this consensus asymmetrically affects the poor who have less control over their cash flow when rates are high they can t defer consumption they have bills to pay and necessities to buy when rates are low they have neither the spare capital nor the collateral base to take full advantage by making investments the way that rich people can the poor can t in technical terms optimise over the yield curve anywhere like as well as the rich can the distributional consequences of increasing interest rates have been empirically assessed in the literature by e g amaral 2017 the more meaningful changes in inequality occur over longer periods of time than the horizon at which monetary policy operates and are most likely the result of structural changes while monetary policy may have some redistributive consequences their magnitude seems to be small ampudia et al 2018 or bunn et al 2018 meanwhile colciago et al 2018 review the literature and conclude that empirical research on the effect of conventional monetary policy on income and wealth inequality yields very mixed findings although there seems to be a consensus that higher inflation at least above some threshold increases inequality douglas acknowledges that redistributive taxation can compensate for the distributional impact of interest rate adjustments but leaves the open ended question why not therefore use tax to control inflation instead why not skip the middleman brian romanchuk on the other hand takes issue with those critics of mmt who argue that it leads to inflation or hyperinflation the whole premise of mmt is that too much spending leads to too much inflation and that is to be avoided the only real debate is how much spending is too much to critics that say that mmt is nothing new romanchuk answers that mmt should be seen as building from post keynesian theory the key point to understand is that mmt is part of a long line of post keynesian theory and in academic circles is described as such the mmt moniker can either be viewed as a branding exercise or an attempt to create a consistent body of thought within the wider post keynesian literature this latter step was necessary since we have to admit that the post keynesian project was a practical failure finally romanchuk tries to assert the t in mmt naming and expanding on two divergences between neoclassical and mmt economists their takes on overlapping generations models and on the inter temporal governmental budget constraint the zlb is where both sides see eye to eye there seems to be however one instance in which both sides can agree and that is when the zero lower bound zlb comes knocking at the door portes notes that taking fiscal policy as the main tool may be called for under the zlb although in his view that s no longer controversial and was explicitly recognised by government policy during and immediately after the 2008 financial crisis in fact back in october simon wren lewis had weighed mmt and non mmt against a five question framework and concluded that whenever the economy is not on the zlb using fiscal policy as the main stabilisation tool is less desirable as it is slower to implement cannot be delegated and is subject to political incentives a potentially strong argument against monetary policy is the lower bound problem you could argue that having monetary policy as the designated stabilisation instrument gets government out of the habit of doing fiscal stabilisation so that when you do hit the lower bound and fiscal stabilisation is essential it does not happen recent experience only confirms that concern after an intense week of social media spats it is unclear where this discussion will lead in practice perhaps the most interesting element is that political clout brought mainstream and heterodox to talk to each other in any case delong leaves us with a silver lining the government should make it its first priority to use its tools of economic management so that we do not experience either and maybe the government needs to be a little bit clever in how it uses fiscal and when and how it uses monetary policy to keep the task of financing the national debt from becoming an undue or even an unsustainable burden

so much for the federal reserve killing the us dollar when fed chair jerome powell signaled last month that rate hikes probably won t happen anytime soon many experts thought that would hurt the dollar powell said the central bank needed to be patient and see what happens next for the us economy low interest rates usually go hand in hand with a weaker currency think of japan and the yen during its lost decades of negative rates deflation and a sluggish economy but the us dollar index has rallied 1 5 against other currencies after the fed s january 30 meeting that has taken many by surprise an increase of 1 5 may not sound like a lot but it s actually a fairly dramatic move in the usually sleepy world of currencies the dollar is now up slightly year to date blue chip us companies hurt by stronger greenback that could wind up being a problem for big us multinational companies market leaders that are the biggest components of the dow and s p 500 a stronger dollar eats into the value of their international sales dow components apple boeing caterpillar and 3m generate a significant amount of their sales from foreign markets those are stocks that almost every average investor probably has some exposure to through popular etfs or mutual funds in a 401 k account or ira a stronger dollar has already helped drag down growth at companies that have reported their fourth quarter earnings s p 500 companies with more than half of their sales coming from the us have posted earnings growth of 16 6 according to data from factset that compares to growth of just 8 4 for companies with more than half of their sales generated overseas the strong dollar is just one of the reasons why multinational profits have lagged economic weakness in europe the uk china japan and other international markets is to blame as well those two things are related if the us economy remains healthier than most other major developed and developing countries the dollar will likely rally further if that happens that could make the situation even worse for many of america s largest companies when they report first quarter earnings in april china slowdown makes dollar look more attractive several experts do think the dollar rally has legs left in it jameel ahmad global head of currency strategy and market research at fxtm a foreign exchange brokerage firm said in a report this week that investors have been attracted to the dollar because the us economy still looks to be in solid shape he added that those who are fatigued from yo yo trade headlines about the us and china are now starting to focus on the fact china s moderating economic conditions remain a major overhang for the global growth narrative in other words the dollar could keep rallying if china s growth slows further particularly if that winds up dragging down other emerging markets with it but if this sluggishness eventually hits the united states most experts expect it won t hurt america s economic growth all that much that s why the dollar may continue to be the cleanest dirty shirt it s not a question of people flocking to the dollar because they want to it s that the data from europe and china and elsewhere has just gotten markedly worse said boris schlossberg managing director of fx strategy at bk asset management

one of the great claims made for the euro was that it would rival the us dollar as a second global reserve currency these hopes have failed to materialize the euro s importance in global reserves and financial markets today is about the same as it was two decades ago when the euro replaced the deutsche mark and ten other national currencies but hope dies last and in this spirit the european commission recently published a communication entitled towards a stronger international role of the euro sic the european commission like most european policymakers takes it as given that the eurozone would benefit if the euro played a more global role but that is not necessarily true one such benefit supposedly derives from the widespread use of euro banknotes outside the single currency area on this measure at least the euro has been a big success currency in circulation has more than doubled over the last 20 years both in absolute terms and as a percentage of eurozone gdp and the total value of euro banknotes in circulation amounts now to 1 2 trillion 1 3 trillion furthermore it is commonly estimated that a large fraction of euro cash is used outside the eurozone but the economics of banknote issuance have changed issuance was previously a profitable business for central banks because they could invest the proceeds in government bonds with a decent yield with interest rates at 5 per cent and 1 2 trillion of notes in circulation the european central bank could have generated revenue of about 60 billion a year though small compared to the eurozone s overall gdp of 10 trillion this sum is equivalent to almost one half of the eu s budget at today s negative interest rates however currency issuance is no longer profitable this might be another reason why the ecb decided to stop issuing the 500 note which is also much more convenient than the 100 bill for handling large amounts of black money providing a handy vehicle for underground transactions abroad should not be regarded as an advantage of the euro another argument for having a global reserve currency is that foreign borrowing becomes cheaper this is the exorbitant privilege that valéry giscard d estaing when he was france s finance minister famously said the united states enjoyed owing to the dollar s status as the world s main reserve currency but while issuing dollar denominated debt is an important advantage for the us the world s largest debtor the eurozone is a net creditor and with real interest rates tending to be higher in dollar terms it would be better for the eurozone s external assets to be denominated in dollars than in euro furthermore the consequences of being a major anchor currency would be particularly problematic for the euro fortunately the countries that peg their currency to the euro have little economic weight imagine for example that china pegged its currency to the euro instead of to the dollar the chinese authorities would then determine the euro s exchange rate against the dollar the currency of the eu s biggest trading partner and competitor being an anchor currency can actually entail a loss of control true there are other reasons why it might be in europe s interest for the euro to play a larger global role for example the extra territorial application of sanctions by the us makes it extremely difficult for european companies to maintain trade ties with iran because most of iran s international trade is invoiced and settled in dollars but the ability of the us to apply sanctions so widely is essentially due to its diplomatic and military power even if the euro played a much larger role in global finance the us would remain dominant in terms of hard power having a global reserve currency makes sense for a large economy that is not too exposed to the rest of the world the us fits the bill it makes less sense for the somewhat smaller eurozone economy where trade in goods and services accounts for more than one quarter of overall gdp moreover the eurozone s share of the global economy has declined from about 25 per cent when the euro was born to 15 per cent today and will soon fall below 10 per cent the relative weight of the us economy will of course also decrease as china and india continue to grow faster but the dollar will retain its conventional role as the key currency for international trade transactions as long as china limits capital movements to keep control over its domestic economy the euro on the other hand could increase its global role only by slowing the relative decline of the eurozone economy through rapid growth but even assuming that the eurozone s relative decline continues this would not necessarily mean a fall in living standards the share of japan s economy in global gdp has halved over the last 20 years while living standards there have continued to improve albeit slowly either way it is a good thing that early hopes for the euro to become a true global currency have not been realised the eurozone currently is facing enough economic challenges without the additional burden of issuing a global reserve currency when the euro was introduced a generation ago european leaders envisaged a common currency that would come to rival the us dollar as a second global reserve currency that hope has failed to materialize an outcome that european leaders would be wise to welcome

stemco s brake products group will be resolved in 2019 and taking into consideration the macroeconomic forecasts for the company s core end markets overall i am very pleased with the performance of our company during the fourth quarter said steve macadam president and ceo nearly all of our businesses generated year over year sales growth driven by continued favorable demand in many of the markets that we serve sales to the aerospace food pharma heavy duty tractor and trailer builds metals mining refining processing oil gas military marine engines and aftermarket parts and services markets grew year over year as we communicated throughout the year we expected power systems performance to be weighted to the second half of the year and power systems delivered remarkable results in the fourth quarter driven by record aftermarket parts and services sales the sales momentum across the company along with lower sg a resulted in adjusted ebitda growth despite continued cost challenges in stemco s brake products group in sealing products we are focused on resolving the issues that we have faced in stemco s brake products group and we recently announced a restructuring plan to discontinue the manufacturing of brake drum friction products we believe these actions plus others underway across the company are positioning us for margin improvement and free cash flow growth in 2019 given current macroeconomic forecasts planned improvements in stemco s brake products group and anticipated weakness in semiconductor automotive and heavy duty truck oe demand we expect our 2019 full year adjusted ebitda to be between 225 million and 233 million this translates to an adjusted diluted earnings per share outlook of 4 28 to 4 55 for the year said mr macadam full year

market demand and costs subsequent to year end the impact of foreign exchange rate changes subsequent to year end and environmental and any select legacy litigation charges consolidated results for the periods after july 31 2017 reflect the reconsolidation of gst its subsidiaries and oldco as a result of the completion of the acrp given that consolidated results in the year ended december 31 2017 did not reflect all of enpro s entities investors may find comparisons of consolidated results for the year ended december 31 2018 to pro forma results for the prior year to be most illustrative of the year over year performance of all of enpro s businesses pro forma results for the year ended december 31 2017 reflect the performance of all of these businesses for that period demand in the aerospace food pharma heavy duty tractor and trailer builds metals mining and military marine engines and aftermarket parts and services markets was strong during the quarter although year over year growth in sealing products and engineered products was muted by strong prior year results the company s exit of the industrial gas turbine market earlier in the year and softness in the automotive nuclear and u s oil gas pipeline construction markets foreign exchange translation reduced sales by 1 0 versus the fourth quarter of 2017 segment profit in the fourth quarter was down year over year as a result of cost challenges and restructuring expenses in the heavy duty truck portion of sealing products despite growth and improved margins outside of heavy duty truck excluding the impact of costs related to acquisitions and divestitures foreign exchange translation the impact of the change in the loss reserve due to foreign exchange on the edf contract in the power systems segment acquisition inventory fair value adjustments and restructuring charges total segment profit was 15 3 higher compared to the total segment profit in the fourth quarter of last year as previously announced the company implemented a restructuring plan under which its stemco heavy duty truck business subsequently discontinued the manufacturing of brake drum friction products the restructuring plan involved the shutdown of production lines that occupy a portion of stemco s owned manufacturing facility in rome georgia stemco has elected to concentrate its drum friction resources specifically on formulating and sourcing and the company will continue to offer a full range of high quality brake shoes using friction manufactured by approved suppliers who meet stemco s stringent quality standards the company recorded total restructuring expenses related to the exit of approximately 15 4 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 composed of non cash charges primarily related to impairment of inventory equipment and other tangible assets additionally restructuring costs related to the exit include severance and other costs of approximately 0 4 million expected to be incurred in the first half of 2019 the company s average diluted share count in the fourth quarter of 2018 was 20 7 million shares approximately 1 1 million less than in the same period a year ago the decrease was primarily due to share repurchases during 2018 in connection with the 50 million share repurchase program authorized in october 2017 which was completed during the third quarter of 2018 pro forma

quarter of 2018 we adopted an accounting standard that requires an employer to report the service cost component of pension and other postretirement benefits expense in the same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period the other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations we recast our consolidated statements of operations to reflect the retrospective application of this guidance for the quarter ended december 31 2017 this resulted in an increase in cost of sales of 0 2 million a decrease in selling general and administrative expense of 0 4 million and the corresponding increase in other non operating expense of 0 2 million for the year ended december 31 2017 this resulted in an increase in cost of sales of 0 1 million a decrease in selling general and

obligation to update any forward looking statements also we will refer today to certain non gaap financial measures further information regarding our use of these measures and reconciliations of these measures to our gaap results are available in the earnings release and supplemental disclosure on the investor relations portion of our website operator instructions at this time it s my pleasure to introduce jim taylor james taylor chief executive officer president thanks stacy good morning and thank you for joining our 2018 fourth quarter conference call i m really pleased to report on how our team s accomplishments in 2018 were consistent with and even better than the plan we set forth at our investor day in december of 2017 to a record setting anchor leasing a compelling spreads a value accretive reinvestment pipeline that s delivering now growing small shop leasing our opportunistic capital recycling of the bottom quartile of our portfolio and a strengthened balance sheet we ve set the table for accelerating noi growth of 3 or better in 2019 and beyond in a few minutes angela will provide some additional color on the fourth quarter and importantly the impact of the kmart bankruptcy that we previewed on last quarter s call in short the recapture of the kmart space created 90 basis points of drag that coupled with prior year headwinds below the abr line created a tough comp for the quarter however even with those drags we delivered 190 basis points of contribution from the top line and we re able to hold the full year range we had originally provided of 1 to 1 5 but perhaps most importantly recapturing those kmart boxes is eliminated uncertainty for us allowing us to advance accretive reinvestment plans that will transform those centers at very attractive returns for the year we signed a sector leading 8 5 million square feet of new and renewal leases achieving average new and renewal rents of 15 72 a comparable spreads of 14 our spreads on the 4 million feet of new leases averaged 34 importantly we created over 45 million of additional rent with better tenants let me dig into that a bit further first we achieved record small shop leased occupancy of 85 7 a number that we believe has several hundred basis points of additional growth as we continue to recapture space from weaker anchors and bring in concepts that are relevant to the communities we serve expect to see this follow on growth continue this year and beyond continuing our trend of growing our market share of new store openings we signed a record 84 anchor leases for 2 5 million square feet incredibly that record was achieved on a smaller portfolio many of these leases triggered accretive reinvestment projects and also quickly address boxes recapture through bankruptcy we signed new leases with driving tenants like kohl s la fitness sprouts aldi burlington marshal at home maya cinema el rancho schnucks 24 hour fitness ross total wine five below ulta and many others as some of you have noted our progress here in improving tenant quality has led to one of the lowest at risk tenant percentages in our peer group demonstrating the tenants demand to be in our older well located centers we now have leases or loi s on over 80 of the space recaptured through bankruptcy over the last few years at average spreads north of 50 as some of you have also noted in your research our track record of capitalizing on bankruptcies compares very favorably it also underscores very important point that disruption can present a great opportunity when you have attractive rent basis our overall leasing production has now driven the largest gap between build and leased of 350 basis points since ipo that represents over 46 million of signed but not yet commenced around setting much of our expectations for this year and beyond finally and importantly as many of you have also noted we ve remained disciplined with leasing capital in returns keeping capital relatively flat and average term in line by leveraging tenant demand and our low in place rents this strong leasing productivity continue to drive our reinvestment pipeline this year we delivered a 131 million of reinvestment at an average incremental return of 9 creating well over 70 million of incremental value this quarter we commenced an additional 54 million of projects bringing our active pipeline to 350 million at a 9 return and our pipeline continues to grow with over 1 billion of opportunity identified throughout our portfolio at attractive returns we expect to deliver over 161 million of reinvestment in 2019 which is on plan with what we highlighted at our investor day and importantly our active pipeline will improve centers with over 100 million of in place noi which as i discussed on last quarter s call highlights how our projects not only deliver very attractive incremental returns they grow the intrinsic value of the centers impacted it s important to note that the projects we are gearing up for redevelopment are creating over 100 basis point drag on occupancy but the projects that have already delivered or delivering now this year offset this investment and continuing future growth simply put the continued execution of our multi year pipeline moves us relentlessly toward our purpose of owning centers that are center of the communities we serve we also capitalize on attractive market valuations and liquidity to dispose over 60 assets this year raising 1 billion in proceeds at an average cap rate of nearly 150 basis points inside our average market implied cap rate by executing these as one off transactions we not only captured an additional 50 million to 75 million over what would have been achieved in larger portfolio trades we also unlocked over 250 million of nav versus where our shares were trading we achieved that on assets that are in the bottom quartile of our portfolio with population densities and incomes that are significantly below our portfolio average we also exited over 50 cities allowing us to focus our capital and markets that we believe have strong underlying supply demand fundamentals we also repaid approximately 800 million and refinanced nearly 3 billion of debt reducing our debt to adjusted ebitda to 6 2 times or 6 5 times if you adjust for straight line rents and fas 141 we now have no debt maturing until 2021 we ve built an all weather balance sheet that provides us maximum flexibility to continue our value added plan to harvest the value intrinsic in our portfolio you also note that we ve reached an agreement and principle with the sec regarding the events that we announced in february of 2016 and which led to the departures of the prior ceo cfo and cao we are pleased to have reached this agreement as well as the settlement of the class actions previously announced and believe that there will be no additional proceedings relating to these matters brought against the company in sum just a few weeks into this new year we are focused and excited for what we expect the year to bring our retail partners continued to demonstrate demand to be in our centers our leasing and reinvestment efforts continue to drive additional growth in our intrinsic value and most importantly our team is energized and ready to deliver continued outperformance angela angela aman executive vice president chief financial officer thanks jim and good morning i m pleased to report on another quarter of strong execution across our platform as we continue to position the company for long term sustainable growth fourth quarter ffo was 0 40 per share which reflects the charge of 0 02 per share related to the sec settlement in addition to the previously disclosed 0 06 per share of loss on debt extinguishment full year ffo was 1 85 per share excluding loss on debt extinguishment the sec settlement and other items that impact comparability ffo was 2 per share versus our original guidance range of 1 95 to 2 04 per share despite having executed on nearly 1 billion of non core and non strategic asset sales during 2018 far in excess of our original expectations as we responded to strength in the private market and rates attractively priced capital to fund our accretive value enhancing reinvestment projects deleverage primarily through the repayment of high cost secured debt and repurchase our stock at attractive valuation same property base rent contributed 190 basis points to same property noi growth in the fourth quarter reflecting strong lease in productivity and redevelopment execution over the last 12 months to 18 months despite the headwinds experienced in the fourth quarter due to the rejection of six of our 11 sears kmart leases which detracted 40 basis points of base rent growth and 90 basis points of noi growth during the quarter as jim discussed while the six locations we took back in the fourth quarter and the additional three locations we expect to take back in the first quarter of 2019 will detract from growth over the course of the year we re well under way with remerchandising and redevelopment plans for nearly all of the space and strongly believe that this bankruptcy has unlocked substantial value creation opportunities of this asset in total same property noi growth during the fourth quarter was negative 0 2 with strong base rent performance being offset by net recoveries and provision for doubtful accounts which detracted 220 basis points from growth in the quarter net recoveries were negatively impacted on a year over year basis by significant positive real estate tax refund and appeal activity in the fourth quarter of 2017 while provision for doubtful accounts or bad debt expense was impacted in the current quarter by the sears kmart bankruptcy we also recognized an unusually low level of bad debt expense in the prior period only 40 basis points of total revenues versus our historical run rate of 75 basis points to 100 basis points you may recall that difficult year over year comparisons in bad debt were the primary reasons that our original same property noi guidance for 2018 included a 50 basis point detraction related to bad debt which is in line with where we ended on a full year basis with the most difficult comparisons in the second half of the year these items and their disproportionate impact on our fourth quarter growth rate underscore the inherent volatility and same property noi growth metrics and serve as an important reminder of why it s critical to have a somewhat longer term view as it relates to the performance of a long term business same property noi growth for 2018 was 1 1 within our original range of 1 to 1 5 with base rent contributing 210 basis points above the midpoint of our original guidance range of 175 basis points to 225 basis points the sears kmart bankruptcy acted as a 20 basis point drag on full year noi growth and absent that event same property noi growth would have been in the upper half of the original range turning to 2019 as jim highlighted the coming year will be an opportunity for the investment community to see accelerating results from the works that has been done over the last three years to create a platform position to take full advantage of the opportunity embedded in this portfolio our same property noi growth guidance for 2019 remains 3 at the midpoint of the range with the growing contribution from recently completed repositioning and redevelopment work across the portfolio more than offsetting additional drag in the future redevelopment pipeline that s being incurred as a result of the timing of recent bankruptcy activity our ffo guidance for 2019 is 1 86 to 1 94 per share in addition to the previously disclosed impact of the continued deceleration in non cash gaap rental adjustments and the lease accounting change this range also reflects strength and same property noi growth as well as the impact of significant back end weighted disposition activity in 2018 the range also includes the potential impact of future capital recycling activity we expect that disposition volume will be lower and the use of proceeds from such activity will be more balanced as we head into 2019 the substantial improvements we made with respect to solidifying our balance sheet last year put us in a position to focus capital allocation on our reinvestment pipeline stock repurchases and or acquisition activity in the coming year as it relates just same property noi and earnings trajectory please note that as a result of the sears kmart bankruptcy billed occupancy is expected to trough in the first half of the year following the additional rejections expected in the first quarter before reaccelerating in the second half as redevelopment completions also accelerate we expect the contribution from base rent and the detraction or contribution from net recoveries to follow the occupancy trajectory throughout the year i would also note that our most challenging bad debt comparison will occur in the second quarter of 2019 as we recognize significant cash payment of amounts previously reserved due to bankruptcy activity in the second quarter of 2018 in summary we entered 2019 well positioned to execute on the business plan we laid out for you at our investor day over a year ago we believe the coming year will demonstrate the growth potential of our asset base the internal capabilities we have developed with respect to redevelopment execution the capital allocation philosophy with which we manage investment activity and the strength and stability of our balance sheet with that i ll turn the call over to the operator for q a questions and answers operator thank you at this time we ll be conducting a question and answer session operator instructions our first question comes from the line of todd thomas with keybanc capital markets please proceed with your question todd thomas keybanc capital markets analyst hi thanks good morning last quarter you mentioned that sears and some other activity would impact 2019 but suggested that it could set up the company for better growth in 2020 and you have a little more clarity around sears you re few months into lease negotiations for some replacement tenants so maybe for brian can you talk about the mark to market expectation a little bit on some of the backfills for the kmart specifically and the general timeline for commencements to begin and then jim can you touch on early thoughts on how this activity might impact 2020 in light of your comments last quarter james taylor chief executive officer president sure go ahead brian finnegan executive vice president of leasing yeah todd i ll take the first part as you mentioned we are pleased with the progress that we ve made on kmart so far we ve got roughly 80 of the gla committed meaning executed lease at lease or final loi with a range of uses many of the tenants that jim mentioned in his opening remarks this quarter we announced the deal with kohl s at our box in lending kentucky which we expect to announce other national tenants later this year and we ll start opening those spaces toward the end of the year that comes on the heels of the box that we announced in greenville kentucky with marshall s hobby lobby and five below so we ve been excited by the demand we re not surprised by it the team has continuously demonstrated the ability to get ahead of these bankruptcies so that we re in a position to quickly address when we get them back and expect to see us continue to announce tenants throughout the year from a rent perspective we re just over 2x the rents in place on the kmart boxes incremental returns in line with what we ve been seeing historically on our kmart spaces and we re excited about the opportunity because we still have boxes in places like miami metro philadelphia and cincinnati that we expect to be bringing online here toward the back half and 2019 and in the 2020 james taylor chief executive officer president yeah and scott todd excuse me i would just add that the activity does set us up well for 2020 and beyond and importantly it eliminates a lot of uncertainty at this point we only have two boxes remaining with kmart one of which we ve negotiated the elimination of options in hamilton new jersey we already have a lot of interest in that box so while we ve been working on over the last two years what you have implicitly suggested has been setting up the ability to drive value in these kmart boxes and not only importantly we getting great returns on the boxes we re also opening up pad opportunities as we get into these 40 year old leases and importantly improving the balance of the center by bringing in uses that are relevant to the communities they serve so as we talked about last quarter the timing of the actual bankruptcy was a little bit sooner than what we thought but we ve been working for the last year and a half to set ourselves up to capitalize on what we think is a great intrinsic growth opportunity in addition to a lot of other opportunities throughout the portfolio todd thomas keybanc capital markets analyst alright that s helpful and then angela in terms of the 3 midpoint for same store noi growth in 2019 which is consistent with what you had said last quarter how much additional reserve is there for additional or incremental speculative fall out and how much visibility or insight do you feel you have about potential future bankruptcies and move outs at this point in the year angela aman executive vice president chief financial officer yeah james taylor chief executive officer president i would first say we expect continued disruption right and i think that s reflected angela angela aman executive vice president chief financial officer yeah i would just add to that it s always tricky to pinpoint a number because of the variety of ways we budget for additional retailer distress or disruption so from a bad debt perspective we consistently model and guide to about 75 basis points to 100 basis points of total revenues is the bad debt reserve we came in at the lower end of that range this year again despite significant bankruptcy activity during the course of 2018 so we feel like we re well covered from a bad debt perspective from a top line perspective we budgeted as we do a zero base budget for every space in the portfolio we re taking a thoughtful look at each space and the spaces we may get back because of retailer distress or disruption and then there is an additional kind of portfolio reserve employed on top of that so it s a very thoughtful process i think in terms of deriving the 3 midpoint and that the overall same property noi range but to jim s point i think we feel very comfortable that we have within that range incorporated our expectations for additional retailer distress or disruption todd thomas keybanc capital markets analyst okay thank you james taylor chief executive officer president you bet thanks todd operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jeremy metz with bmo capital markets please proceed with your question jeremy metz bmo capital markets analyst hey good morning james taylor chief executive officer president good morning jeremy metz bmo capital markets analyst jim you guys stopped disclosing the impact of redevelopments on your same store noi i don t think it had a huge impact on 2018 at the end of the day but you ve obviously talked plenty in recent quarters and even in your opening remarks about the increasingly development activity given few hundred million delivered during the next 12 months or so so can you talk about that decision and then maybe help us help quantify what sort of impact it s actually expected to have on your 3 same store expectations for the year james taylor chief executive officer president we d love to as you think about our business plan and the opportunities that are intrinsic in our portfolio it really runs the gamut jeremy from pad opportunities to end cap repositions to anchor repositions to facade renovations to larger redevelopments and importantly we provide you detail on the significant anchor repositionings all the outparcels and the redevelopments it seemed to be us to be a bit of a distinction without a difference given the breadth of reinvestment opportunity that we have in the portfolio and kind of forces weird decisions about timing as to when things are rolling in and out so we thought it was better to basically show you our aggregate capital that s going into the portfolio where it is what the timing is and what that overall impact is so that s really yeah it s really just how we think about the business and the other thing i would highlight for you is it s a very clean overall noi number because it includes basically the entire portfolio which i think is important but as we step back again and just thought about this it s really opportunity that s intrinsic in the real estate itself we re not creating large mixed use projects we re not taking centers down completely we re not changing drastically their use this is sort of core business stuff it s granular i love it because it s lower risk it s higher return and i also like that it s really spread across the portfolio one thing i m particularly excited about is that we see the ability to impact nearly half of the assets we have through accretive reinvestment everything from a pad ph to again an end cap and anchor repo or a larger facade redevelopment type projects so we re showing you that we re making money on the capital that we re putting to work and importantly i think we re also creating a lot of value on the balance of the center that s being impacted here but again it s core to our business and it seems to us that particular disclosure was somewhat limited angela angela aman executive vice president chief financial officer yeah i would agree with that i would point out that disclosure was really a legacy disclosure that we inherited and didn t really match up with the way that you ve heard jim and i and brian and mark talk about the business over time if you think back to investor day last year we talked about not just read off what was recently completed and currently in process which is what that disclosure was but we also talked about the other part of the life cycle of redevelopment which was the future pipeline and everything that we re teeing up vacancy we re incurring in order to prepare for the next wave of redevelopment none of the future pipeline was shown in that disclosure before so i think as we think about and manage the business and try to communicate externally that disclosure really didn t tied to the way we think about it the points that jim made as well and as a reminder we ve always guided to the total number including redevelopment that s what you ve always seen the more detailed same property disclosure from us in the supplemental around and to the point jim made if you look at the reconciliation in a glossary of our supplemental you ll see there are very few exclusions from our same property pool effectively nearly 100 of the portfolio we showed you in that number jeremy metz bmo capital markets analyst yeah and i think that s all fair i mean from a broad level it just sounds like that it is going to continue to play a bigger role here near term and kind of driving that accelerating growth you highlighted in your opening comments that s fair statement james taylor chief executive officer president yeah absolutely it s part of what excited us when we came on board the company was how broad based the opportunity is but again it s a wide gamut it s not all extensive jeremy metz bmo capital markets analyst appreciate that and second for me just in terms of the asset sales you obviously sold more in 2018 than you had initially expected so obviously expecting last year in 2019 wondering if you could maybe comment on how much you currently have on the market today how much is under contract and then if pricing firms up even more could we see you accelerate some sales to further clean our that bottom tier in single asset markets and perhaps just warehouse some of that capital for future redevelopment james taylor chief executive officer president we always reserve the right to be opportunistic it s part of why we don t provide pin point guidance on things like transactional activity so we did provide a range of what we think the impact will be from the capital recycling in terms of where we expect to be for the year it will be less than where we were in 2018 and i think the important point to note is that we were opportunistic in taking advantage of the liquidity that we found for these assets and the second thing i d note is that we dealt with a lot of the bottom of the portfolio and that s really important so as we look forward we have a few more assets that we re going to be sellers of but we ve dealt with many of the ones that just weren t consistent with our long term plan and all of that hard work and it was what i was trying to allude to in my prepared remarks has set us up in 2019 and 2020 and beyond to be more balanced and the other comment i d make is i think that any good long term business plan had some degree of capital recycling so because of all the work that we ve done in 2018 it sets us up to be balanced in 2019 balanced in 2020 and so forth as it relates to some of the remaining single asset markets please understand that some of those will be growth markets for us and i m very pleased that we ve exited as many of the cities as we have because it has greatly simplified the portfolio and frankly sharpen the focus of the team on the execution of the value added strategy and opportunity that we have jeremy metz bmo capital markets analyst thanks for the time james taylor chief executive officer president you bet operator thank you our next question comes from the line of craig schmidt with bank of america please proceed with your question craig schmidt bank of america merrill lynch analyst thank you your combined leasing spreads remained double digit but when you look at the trend they tightened over the course of 2018 i wonder what was driving this trend and what you re expecting from leasing spreads in 2019 james taylor chief executive officer president part of that was really driven by mix in the latter part of the year we executed some shorter term renewals to facilitate redevelopment which had some drag on that new and renewal spread for the quarter but we do expect our spreads for new and renewal leases to be in that mid teen range going forward i would point you to importantly what we ve been doing on the new lease spreads which for the year averaged 34 and also some of brian s commentary in terms of the embedded mark to market for example that we see in the kmart boxes so we re still seeing that opportunity one of the other things that i m excited about is we re also driving acceleration in the small shops right and that s really important you re beginning to see it this quarter and you re going to see it for the balance and the reason i highlight that is that we re capitalizing on what we re doing with these larger boxes and anchors as follow through throughout the portfolio and frankly we re setting new records as it relates to small shop rents so i expect that combined spread for next year to be pretty consistent with what it s been over the last couple of years and i m excited about how we are leveraging our improving centers craig schmidt bank of america merrill lynch analyst great and then second i would just say how active are the grocers in pursuing buy online and pickup in stores and what is the longer term impact for cross shopping with that increase brian finnegan executive vice president of leasing craig this is brian they re very active and we have been very encouraging of our grocery partners to add this it s a very low investment for us almost none we give a couple of parking spaces and it creates several more trips and engagement with the consumer and obviously more traffic to the center means more sales for the rest of our tenant partner or retail partners we have quick progress at roughly half our locations we ve been doing this with hed ph we re working with stop shop so across the spectrum we re working with our traditional retail grocers to add this where we can we re doing it with walmart as well so we re going to continue to do this as much as possible craig schmidt bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay and just the people i noticed that are using this service really seem to be focused on saving time that they re actually willing to pay a little more money to have somebody walk up and down the aisles of the grocery to have is that also going to limit their willingness to cross shop james taylor chief executive officer president it might allow them to work out at orange theory have a cup of coffee at panera and i actually love that the grocers are focused on their the strong grocers are focused on the customer and the customer experience and early on in these discussions to brian s point we jumped all over this program of adding these pickup lanes to our centers what s actually interesting is that there is often times shopping within the store that occurs with the pickup of groceries and i do also think that the interaction between the grocer and the customer is improved by that level of service so particularly when you look at how some of the better grocers are executing upon it so we think it s a net positive and the last thing i d say on this is that i think strong retailers are going to continue to evolve adjust their formats importantly have capital to do that and we want to be supportive of them and we want to have shopping centers that gives them the flexibility to do that which we re demonstrating effectively now as we are dividing boxes adding space doing other things to try to make sure that we re getting tenants like our recent downsize of burlington our recent downsize to kohl s to the format that they want to be in the format that they re going to thrive in and what s fun is that we re doing it off of pretty low rents so we re able to do it and make money in the process so a little bit broader than your question but the point i m trying to make is that i think retail is going to continue to evolve and the important thing is the landlord is that you have the flexibility and importantly the rent bases to meet the needs of your tenants and if you look at the market share that we re capturing at the new store openings i think it shows you that we are really doing a very good job on that so i m excited about the change i don t really see it as a threat i think you ve got to be clear eyed about what its implications are and certainly in some instances it s informing our capital recycling decisions right it s part of why that will always be part of our plan but again i m kind of excited for what these changes are bringing craig schmidt bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay thanks for your thoughts james taylor chief executive officer president you bet operator thank you our next question comes from the line of greg mcginniss with scotiabank please proceed with your question greg mcginniss scotiabank analyst hi good morning angela there was a lot of work done this year extending debt term bringing down the blended interest rate but i m curious if there is any ability or desire to proactively address total debt to ebitda leverage in 2019 angela aman executive vice president chief financial officer yeah i think greg to your point we did make a tremendous amount of progress on the balance sheet this year not just in terms of working down that debt to ebitda number but like you said extending duration putting us in a position where we have no debt maturities at this point until 2021 expanding the flexibility of the balance sheet repaying all that secured debt has created a tremendous amount of operational and financial flexibility across the capital stack so we re really pleased with the progress we made in 2018 i do think we re sitting at a point in time now where while we remain committed to getting down to that six times number a lot of the additional progress you re going to see is going to come from ebitda growth and all of jim s earlier comments about the benefits of all the work we ve done over the last couple of years in terms of repositioning and redevelopment work really coming to provision it s going to be a significant driver of how we make additional progress on that leverage metrics from this point going forward greg mcginniss scotiabank analyst thanks and so the second question with the sign versus build occupancy gap between at 50 bps how much does that translate to on an noi basis and what s the expectation on closing that gap james taylor chief executive officer president well again we have over 46 million of rent that s been signed and not yet commenced and that brand is going to be commencing over the next six quarters to eight quarters and it is a clear driver of what we see our noi growth to be for this year and next year timing this year is going to be critical i mentioned it on last call but because of the deals that we ve signed up every day of rent commencements worth about a couple of hundred grand for us on average so it s a good problem to have and i m glad at this point that we re able to drive the demand in the leasing activity for the spaces that we re taking back the spaces that we re recapturing proactively or in the case of kmart dealing with a timing issue that bankruptcy being sooner than we expected which certainly help contribute to that gap between build and lease and as angela said our build number is likely going to continue to drag a little bit in the first part of the year as we take back those kmart boxes but again when you dig into the leases that we are signing the redevelopments that they re setting up it s really a big component the visibility that we have on our growth there is not a lot of speculative assumptions as it relates to where noi is coming from we know it the leases are signed we have rent commencement dates scheduled as i mentioned over the next six to eight quarters and so for us from an execution standpoint the real focus is going to be on timing craig schmidt bank of america merrill lynch analyst alright okay thank you james taylor chief executive officer president you bet operator thank you our next question comes from the line of samir khanal with evercore isi please proceed with your question samir khanal evercore isi analyst yes good morning i guess getting back to the 350 basis points wide in lease versus occupied what is the i know that that s going to narrow but what is kind of the normalized spread going forward i mean is it 250 basis points angela aman executive vice president chief financial officer yeah i would say historically it s been probably between 150 basis point and 200 basis points so you should see over time significant compression in that number samir khanal evercore isi analyst okay and then brian i guess for you just taking a step back can you generally talk about where your watch list is today versus this time last year maybe excluding sears and kmart so where does that watch list stand today brian finnegan executive vice president of leasing it s definitely smaller obviously those were the two names that we had been watching for a while there are still some uses in tenants out there that were keeping a closer eye on but the magnitude of last year s bankruptcies are certainly smaller as we look into this year samir khanal evercore isi analyst okay and as part of your watch list i mean do you have any concerns of sort of the traditional grocers going forward i mean what is kind of your thought on that segment james taylor chief executive officer president yeah let me take that initially the concern or the focus on grocers is always on occupancy costs and you look at that per square foot sales productivity relative to your rents and as we ve said many times we re benefited by our average occupancy costs that are well below 2 so even in the instance of a grocer that may not continue it gives you a lot of optionality in terms of backfilling that space with another grocer or quite frankly with another use brian finnegan executive vice president of leasing yeah it s interesting this quarter we announced hearthstone corners in houston we backfilled with an el rancho for a traditional grocer that hadn t put a lot of capital into that store in some time they re are coming in they are much more relevant to the community there they re probably going to do 30 to 50 more in volume it s allowed us to really advance our follow on leasing at the center so as we look out and jim mentioned capital recycling earlier we re looking at areas where our grocers are not investing and where they are and making sure that we re focused on that our anchors continue to invest in our locations samir khanal evercore isi analyst i guess as a follow up jim are you seeing any sort of cap rate expansion on some of these grocery anchored centers kind of any secondary markets especially when buyers are becoming a little bit concern on kind of traditional grocers james taylor chief executive officer president yeah our cap rates have held pretty firm for what we ve actually transacted on mark i don t know if you re on do you want to take that mark horgan executive vice president chief investment officer yeah thank you you ve hit the nail on the head jim when we looked at our assets that we traded on the year over year basis so like for like so similar assets in our markets we actually saw pretty stable cap rates so yeah we have really haven t seen a big impact on cap rate movement for that factor samir khanal evercore isi analyst okay thank you james taylor chief executive officer president you bet operator thank you our next question comes from the line of christy mcelroy with citi please proceed with your question christy mcelroy citi analyst hi good morning everyone angela sorry if i missed this do you have an assumption in your guidance for unsecured debt issuance in 2019 later this year and maybe you can talk about sort of any indications of pricing today and then what do you plan to deal with the swaps that burn off in march angela aman executive vice president chief financial officer yeah thanks christy i would say if you look at the guidance walk down we provided we do have a 0 03 range between 0 07 and 0 10 on a line that it includes the impact of leverage reduction last year the share repurchase activity from last year and then all other items so it would be embedded within that 0 03 range what i would say it s just a reminder and i mentioned this in response to greg s question earlier but we don t have any debt maturities at this point until 2021 so we ve really put ourselves in a position where no additional unsecured issuance is necessary but obviously we ve embedded within the range the ability to do something should be opportunistic to do so and continue to advance our goals of extending term and weighted average duration across the balance sheet in terms of the swaps as you mentioned we have 400 million of swap burning off in march we would look to we ll evaluate the market as those burn off and determine what the optimal outcome is for those and that sort of plays into the first question you had about do we term out some of that floating rate debt to begin with so any expectations with respect to both the unsecured debt issuance in the swap would be embedded within that 0 03 range in that other line in the markdown christy mcelroy citi analyst okay and then just in terms of the recaptured kmart in q4 and q1 how much capital would you expect to sort of go into those boxes and in terms of retenanting and would that be considered sort of the normal leasing capex bucket or would that be the redevelopment bucket and just longer term as you think about sort of the 350 million active pipeline but just in terms of the billion dollar of opportunities going forward that you talked about would you expect that pipeline to continue to be self funded with free cash flow angela aman executive vice president chief financial officer yeah i mean as we look out i think this year we re probably running somewhere around 75 million of free cash flow after we fund the dividend which gives us a great base from which to continue to invest and value accretive reinvestment activity across the portfolio the remainder of what we need to fund that activity will come from primarily disposition activity but we view that as jim said earlier capital recycling as a fundamental part of the business you would see us do some of that activity no matter what really in any given year to continue to reinvest in the portfolio and generate growth from that point forward brian finnegan executive vice president of leasing and then christie in terms of the kmart i mean we ve been seeing those on average around call it 80 to 90 bucks a foot inclusive of the demising split when we re putting new facades on working with loading docks and the tenant ti s that are part of that and that s been very consistent throughout markets and i think i mentioned on the last call one of the benefits to the platform and continuing to grow share with a lot of the retailers that you mentioned is the team is getting pretty good at being able to deliver to prototype and what is in a regular box and it s not the typical ground up scenario we ve done a number of these so we ve been able to keep some cost efficiencies in line and working with our retail partners on the operation side mark horgan executive vice president chief investment officer and again i think the numbers that brian quotes are numbers where we are going to split the box we ve had a few executions where we haven t split the box but that s a pretty good estimate that 80 70 to 80 90 a foot generally speaking to demise the box and then where it fits within the pipeline just depends on what we re doing outside of the box are we adding pads are we changing the balances of the facades are we adding space that then tends to move it into one bucket or the other christy mcelroy citi analyst got you thank you james taylor chief executive officer president you bet operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jeff donnelly with wells fargo please proceed with your question jeffrey donnelly wells fargo analyst good morning folks maybe just a first question for angela i m just curious compared to prior years can you talk about some of the assumptions in the 2019 budget that you re making on things like tenant renewal rates particularly around the at risk tenants when their leases mature this year and maybe perhaps the length of downtime you re assuming between leases because i know that bad debt expense doesn t effectively capture all the assumptions you re making in around revenue recognition angela aman executive vice president chief financial officer yeah so my comment earlier about kind of how we budget what the process really is the only line item i would say in our budget process that s more of sort of a portfolio metric is really that bad debt expense your point now we ll capture some of the retailer disruption you have but it s also embedded in abr aligned to your question jeff our budget process is a very granular space by space budget process so we are making very specific assumptions for each tenant in the portfolio not just for the watchlist tenants but across the board based on feedback we re getting from tenants about their sales and their productivity in those locations as well so that s certainly a sort of how we budget and inform the process and like i mentioned earlier we then take a portfolio look and sort of right size those i would say across the board renewals probably look excluding redevelopment assets where we might not be renewing people because we re completing something bigger or more holistic at the asset i would say that retention rates look pretty similar to previous years but again sort of underlying that is specific lease by lease assumptions for every tenant in the portfolio jeffrey donnelly wells fargo analyst understood and then i m just curious the value enhancing projects that were added to the pipeline this quarter i think you guys said we re coming in at around an 8 yield is that indicative of where that you expect the yield to be on your kmart boxes where they ll ultimately pencil out and maybe a second part of that yields a bit below the 9 to 14 range for the overall value enhancing pipeline is that just a mix issue or is that maybe reflective of a broader trend in rents or capital cost james taylor chief executive officer president it s absolutely a mix issue and as we look at those kmart returns they can be in the low teens we ve had a couple in the high single digits it s kind of across the board and then again jeff depends on how much value we re able to harvest by recapturing that 40 year old lease and then frankly are we a longer term holder of the asset or will we drive more value and a better irr simply by backfilling the box and finding liquidity for the center in the markets but we are seeing continued strong demand from our core tenants for the spaces that we recapture i think that s most importantly we are also seeing increases in cost construction costs in particular which are having a bit of a drag in terms of returns but it s you re going from 11 to 10 or 9 to an 8 12 to 11 that type of thing it s not rendering the decision to move forward with the value added investment no longer viable jeffrey donnelly wells fargo analyst okay thanks guys james taylor chief executive officer president you bet operator thank you our next question comes from the line of ki bin kim with suntrust robinson humphrey please proceed with your question ki bin kim suntrust robinson humphrey analyst thanks good morning everyone so curious about one thing if i look at the ti per square foot it s been pretty steady for the past couple of years but if i look at the maintenance capex is actually grown over the past two years even though the portfolio size has shrunken so just curious about what s causing that james taylor chief executive officer president well one thing to highlight is you re including i think in that the leasing capital which reflects the fact that even on a smaller portfolio we ve leased more space right so our productivity continues to be strong so you need to look at it as we also show you in the disclosure on that net effective basis we are spending more in recurring maintenance capital per foot we were i think around 0 55 or 0 60 a foot reflecting our effort to bring these assets up to our proudly owned and operated by standard i would expect that rate of spend to begin to moderate as we get through more of the portfolio and address some of the items in deferred maintenance but importantly that investment that we re making is driving momentum in small shop and it s also driving some of our rents so we think it s the right thing to do from a stewardship perspective and again i can t emphasize this enough capital allocation is something that we take very seriously and if we see an asset that requires more capital than it s warranted by the rents and the growth in rents that we can get we sell it and that drove a huge amount of the decision in 2018 as we move forward again our mission as a company is to own the center of the community we serve we wanted to be relevant we wanted to be local we wanted to thrive and to do that we need to make sure that we re operating them to a certain standards so some of the pickup in the recurring capital you re seeing there but again i think it s being more than paid for by the rents ki bin kim suntrust robinson humphrey analyst okay and in your lease negotiations with tenants has there been any noticeable change in the level of expense pass throughs that you re able to push on to tenants brian finnegan executive vice president of leasing no ki bin actually it s come from our side really is is we ve gone to tenants and talk to them about the increased investments that we re making in our centers and talking about what we re going to do we re seeing receptiveness on their side to contribute to those investments so it has come up in our negotiations but we are proactively doing it because we want to make sure particularly where we re making investments in some centers that have needed it that we re getting reimbursed for those investments james taylor chief executive officer president and as a result of those efforts brian is referring to you will see our recovery percentages continue to improve and that as i think is an area it s an opportunity for us going forward ki bin kim suntrust robinson humphrey analyst right ok thank you james taylor chief executive officer president you bet operator thank you our next question comes from the line of wes golladay with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question wesley golladay rbc capital markets analyst hey good morning everyone looking at the value enhancing projects for 2019 what are you budgeting for capital expenditures and do you plan to start any of the major developments that are in the shadow pipeline angela aman executive vice president chief financial officer yeah i think in terms of capital expenditures as jim said in 2019 i would expect that maintenance capex runs probably somewhere in the 0 45 to 0 50 a square foot area leasing capital as you know will be entirely dependent on productivity but given as we talked about the strong tenant demand we re seeing for a lot of the bankruptcy space we re still in the process for addressing it could certainly be a high productivity year from a leasing standpoint the value enhancing bucket we ve continued to talk about ramping that bucket of capital spend is 150 million to 200 million range we were about 170 million in 2018 in total i think you could be at the higher end of that range is not a touch above as we head into 2019 based on the acceleration of some of the kmart projects that had potentially already been scheduled for late 2019 or into 2020 but we ll be spending that capital little earlier in the process james taylor chief executive officer president and importantly we expect to deliver over 150 million this year so we re not asking you to wait we re getting these projects done we re delivering them on time on budget on return wesley golladay rbc capital markets analyst yeah in the shadow pipeline two projects in particular had a residential component potential there is there any updates to that and could more properties have residential components james taylor chief executive officer president we ve identified over 50 assets based on market in place rents might make sense to support residential or senior assisted living or some other complementary uses across the portfolio but as i ve said on the last couple of calls really in the 2019 we re focused on the lower hanging fruit and we re working very hard to set up some of that additional value extraction that we think presents itself in end markets like miami and southern and northern california and throughout the northeast but not a lot this year so don t expect us to talk much about it other than to say we re setting it up and it s coming wesley golladay rbc capital markets analyst okay thanks a lot james taylor chief executive officer president you bet operator thank you our next question comes from the line of derek johnston with deutsche bank please proceed with your question shivani sood deutsche bank analyst hi thanks this is shivani on for derrick johnson just on the private market side we heard some commentary that there is a greater demand for our larger pools this time last year you guys had mentioned that there were north of 60 individual disposition transactions last year just curious if you could sort of comment on demand across transaction sizes and what you re sort of targeting into 2019 james taylor chief executive officer president mark mark horgan executive vice president chief investment officer sure yeah i think we certainly are starting to see some larger deals get done however i do think as we ve looked at the market last year and going into next year the most critical factor continues to be size and i think that s pretty consistent across the markets there are really just a wide range of buyers for assets in that 30 million to 40 million area and below it s driven by the private reits some certain traditional funds the high net worth buyers and there has been a growing private equity bid for power centers in part it s driven by the attractive financing environment given where we re seeing the tenure but really when you start to get above that level i do think you see a drop in buyer demand and i think you see some more price sensitivity so we have seen some big assets going to market i haven t traded and i think that maybe where we ll see some pricing movement and some opportunity even in some of the core primary markets and as we continue to capital recycle i think that s a pretty important opportunity for us to take advantage of shivani sood deutsche bank analyst thanks and then brian if you could just give us an update on sort of leasing sentiment what you ve seen so far in 2019 versus last year and maybe just remind us of the payless exposure that as in the portfolio right now brian finnegan executive vice president of leasing yeah sure i ll take the first part first in terms of demand we ve continued to see strong open device from the retailers in categories that have been thriving in our space for some time jim mentioned our anchor activity last year was a record on a much smaller portfolio and those retailers continue to have strong open to buys for 2019 and 2020 whether that s in the value apparel best in class fitness specialty grocery health and wellness or home categories and then in terms of payless we ve been monitoring the situation there there is obviously nothing that s been announced so we don t have visibility if there will be some type of event or if we will get any spaces back what i would point to is the progress that we ve made on the payless basis that we have taken back which we ve addressed roughly 70 of those through either lease executions or as part of a redevelopment or outparcel development the ones that we ve executed we ve had spreads of over 30 recently with tenants such as club pilates and america s best uses that are really driving that small shop growth that jim mentioned earlier and the spaces that are part of redevelopments and outparcels we expect to drive considerable value out of those so so as we look at what we ve done with payless the momentum that we have in small shops and the depth and breadth of demand that we see in the small shop space we are pretty confident that should we get some of these spaces back we ll be able to put better uses in at higher rents angela aman executive vice president chief financial officer yeah the total exposure shivani is about 20 basis points of gla or 30 basis points of abr for all of the location shivani sood deutsche bank analyst excellent thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of han zhang with j p morgan please proceed with your question han zhang j p morgan analyst hi i was wondering under what circumstances would you return to being i guess the significant net sellers that you were in 2018 and as it relates to the volume of capital recycling in your 2017 investor day you laid out a target of 400 million and 600 million of annual capital recycling do you expect to be within that range this year or under that thank you james taylor chief executive officer president thank you for the question i think it s probably going to be close to that range again we re not going to provide specific guidance but we are reverting to a more normalized level which we see is 3 to 5 of the portfolio and what drives us to sell more honestly having done the hard work last year is going to be the opportunities that we see on the other side what types of acquisitions additional reinvestment activity share repurchases et cetera so we re real pleased to be in the position that we re in now because it allows us to be opportunistic and frankly as cap rates move up and down because we re more balanced we can capitalize on that on the other side han zhang j p morgan analyst thank you james taylor chief executive officer president you bet operator thank you our next question comes from the line of vince tibone with green street advisors please proceed with your question vince tibone green street advisors analyst good morning can you provide an update on the former toys r us spaces just curious how backfilled demand and net effective rents have trended against your original expectations james taylor chief executive officer president sure this is brian so of the ten we took back either committed meaning either leases are executed or at least final roi we announced another one this quarter in ann arbor michigan with a regional furniture operator a 54 rent spread we had said on prior calls that we thought our rent growth expectation on these would be between 20 to 30 we re trending toward the higher end of that range and the range of uses is what i alluded to earlier in the call we still are seeing demand from best in class fitness home family entertainment value apparel very similar to who we ve been talking about when we re splitting some of the kmart boxes so then pleased with the demand and like kmart expect us to continue to announce lease signings as we progress throughout the year vince tibone green street advisors analyst that s really helpful thanks one last one for me just with anchor build occupancy declined by about 170 basis points compared to the third quarter just wondering besides the six kmart s what other closures contributed to this decline james taylor chief executive officer president sure we did have the bankruptcy impact that came in from fallas that happened in the fourth quarter which we took those spaces back toward the end of the year we also had some proactive downsizes that we did one on a development that we have outside of philadelphia where we re downsizing a burlington for sprouts another where we re downsizing a kohl is part of our development in speedway in the outside of indianapolis indiana and one in a project in naperville illinois where we re working with the fitness operators that we are close to finalizing something with so that was that s really withdrawn in addition to the kmart bankruptcies vince tibone green street advisors analyst alright that s helpful and for the fallas is that a big issue or this is the only way you can quantify there just were few locations or how big of an impact was that bankruptcy james taylor chief executive officer president yeah we had i want to say it was close to 10 locations that we had with fallas overall it wasn t a big issue to say but we have demand for those boxes we re already at lease on a handful of the spaces so it was somewhat again that was on our watch list so we had been marketing a number of these spaces expect some of them to start coming online this year and many of them paying rent in 2020 vince tibone green street advisors analyst great thanks that s all i have operator thank you our next question comes from the line of linda tsai with barclays please proceed with your question linda tsai barclays analyst hi just a follow up on tenant fallout angela you noted that 75 to 100 bps was budgeted for unknown tenant fallout in 2018 and that came in at low end that said that s was noi growth for 2018 came in a little bit below the midpoint at 1 1 versus 1 25 why was that angela aman executive vice president chief financial officer yeah so the 75 to 100 basis points isn t really for unknown tenant fallout that s for bad debt expense that provision for doubtful accounts line that you see in the same property noi reconciliation that takes into account things like bankruptcy activity or fallout for outstanding ar balances but also other ar across the portfolio stepping back i think in terms of where we how we had originally budgeted tenant pull out versus what materialize during the year i think we were even clear back at investor day that something like the sears kmart situation and the impact that could have to us was not fully contemplated in the range and so i think what you really saw was a big impact in the fourth quarter like we talked about 90 basis points related to sears kmart hitting the fourth quarter but we re more than offset that with strong leasing productivity over the course of the year and execution on redevelopments that really helped to make sure that we stayed comfortably within that original range we had given linda tsai barclays analyst so tenant fallout or well the 75 bps to 100 bps for that category came at the low end but then angela aman executive vice president chief financial officer but then you had other things offsetting it in the abr aligned linda tsai barclays analyst okay and then i read a while back that kohl s was going to provide space to all the 10 of its locations have you seen any of these open or is this going to occur at any of your properties brian finnegan executive vice president of leasing lind this is brian it s not occurring in our properties but i think it speaks to their view to drive to get into the best footprint that they can as i just mentioned in prior question we re doing that we re doing it we just announced another one with burlington where we downsized and we re bringing another specialty grocer in in seminole florida in addition to what we ve done in marlton so we have had discussions with kohl s they re a great partner of ours in terms of the footprint that they re in in our centers and there are a handful of locations where we re talking to them about proactively taking space back because we know the tenant demand and we can execute on and ourselves but we haven t had any throughout the portfolio yet where they ve just gone ahead and downsized and backfilled with all the or any of the other tenants that they ve been talking to linda tsai barclays analyst thanks operator thank you our next question comes from the line of caitlin burrows with goldman sachs please proceed with your question caitlin burrows goldman sachs analyst hi i just had a quick follow up on to the few questions on the capital recycling i was just wondering if you could discuss as you go forward and you re more balanced in terms of dispositions versus and the uses of those proceeds what do you think would be a cap rate spread and do you think it would be positive or could it start out with being i guess negative and then growing as you put more effort into leasing or what have you at the various properties james taylor chief executive officer president well i think that what we ve capital recycle to date and the work that we ve done represents really the bottom of the portfolio so as we move forward all other things being equal we would expect to see good performance in cap rates it s going to be driven by mix and then on the reinvestment side it s going to be driven by the reinvestment yields that we disclose certainly cap rates on acquisitions can be 100 to 200 basis points inside of the assets that we might be selling again our focus on the acquisition side is to make sure that we buy assets that have growth similar to our entire portfolio i mean you think about our portfolio as an asset what sets it apart is the below market rents and the ability to put accretive capital to work so that would imply as we continue to find other assets that are complementary to our portfolio lower cap rates people pay for irr and then of course share repurchases are an opportunity for us as well but again because of the work that we ve done with the capital recycling with the balance sheet it allows us to be much more flexible going forward and balanced as we make those capital allocation decisions caitlin burrows goldman sachs analyst got it so just in terms of potential property acquisitions going forward we might see that the acquisition cap rates could be relatively lower than dispositions but the idea is that long term they would have higher growth and that s why they would make sense james taylor chief executive officer president yeah absolutely we re not interested in assets that don t provide a view of how you re going to grow your roi caitlin burrows goldman sachs analyst okay thank you james taylor chief executive officer president you bet operator thank you this concludes our question and answer session i ll turn the floor back to ms slater for any final comments stacy slater senior vice president investor relations

it s looking as though a familiar dynamic is taking hold a fundamental search for yield in an environment that supports risk taking is seeing capital move out of safer assets in fixed income and cash markets and into higher yield equity markets boding well for global equity indices in the short to medium term 5 for now its fed before fundamentals market participants have proven their concern is first with the fed and financial conditions followed by fundamental concerns like earnings global growth and concomitant factors like the trade war and geopolitical ructions again that balance would shift in the event recession risk becomes too heightened while not an immediate problem now such a risk ought not to be waived away economic data is treading a fine line especially in europe and would indicate the world economy is on some sort of slippery slope china is in the same boat but unfortunately the opacity of their financial system and economy make it difficult to garner a credible view on the middle kingdom the us stands out as a beacon in the global economy presently and is willed by the bulls to maintain its currently solid growth outlook 6 inflation risk looking low one risk that doesn t appear too bothersome for traders in fact it may be a welcomed dynamic is that inflation in developed markets is apparently flatlining once again it was a theme of last night s trade market s received inflation data out of the u k and us economies prefacing the release of chinese cpi data today on balance cpi missed expectations in both the us and uk overnight presumably to the relief of central bankers who in the face of market volatility and growth concerns would loathe being pushed into hiking rates because of an inflation outbreak in response to the news traders maintained their position that global rates will stay low this year as the global economy wrangles with its current funk 7 european bond curves flattening greenback stands to benefit bond curves have flattened in the european region consequently bizarrely and this does not bode well for the euro and pound potentially markets are still pricing in some chance of a rate hike still from the bank of england or european central bank this year far be it to argue with the will and wisdom of the market but given brexit tensions and clear signs of cracks in the continent s economy the notion rates can move higher in this dynamic is fanciful the us dollar will be a barometer for european and probably global growth risks as well as the rate outlook for the boe and ecb although the greenback is still range bound here and now a desire for safety and higher yield should attract investors to treasuries and subsequently bolster the usd going forward 8 market watch spi futures up 7 points or 0 1 to 6025 at about 6 10am aedt aud 0 1 to 71 02 us cents nzd 1 1 to 68 10 us cents nzd 1 to 95 87 australian cents on wall st at 2 09pm dow 0 4 s p 500 0 3 nasdaq 0 3 in new york bhp 1 2 rio 1 3 atlassian 0 1 in europe stoxx 50 0 4 ftse 0 8 cac 0 4 dax 0 4 spot gold 0 1 to us1311 77 an ounce at 1 22pm new york time brent crude 1 9 to us63 60 a barrel us oil 1 9 to us54 10 a barrel iron ore 0 5 to us87 22 a tonne dalian iron ore 0 6 to 620 yuan lme aluminium flat at us1860 a tonne lme copper 0 3 to 6125 a tonne 2 year yield us 2 53 australia 1 73 5 year yield us 2 52 australia 1 78 10 year yield us 2 79 australia 2 15 germany 0 12 us australia 10 year yield gap as of 5 20am aedt 55 basis points this column was produced in commercial partnership between the sydney morning herald the age and ig
after more than a decade of corruption inept government and economic collapse most venezuelans are done with the radical populist movement that promised to make everything better but instead made everything much worse until 2014 the venezuelan socialists still had enough believers to win elections but then a majority of voters realized that the socialists were making the situation worse and tried to vote them out there followed three years of increasingly blatant violations of the venezuelan law and customs to keep the corrupt and self destructive socialists in power the last fair vote had elected a parliament or national assembly in late 2015 that despite efforts by the socialists to eliminate it kept going the socialists were determined to maintain the appearance of being the legitimate government of venezuela and that effort suddenly unraveled in early january 2019 when juan guaidó the newly elected by fellow members of the national assembly head of the national assembly was sworn in on january 5th his assumption of that position was generally recognized as legal but on january 10th nicolás maduro was sworn in as president of venezuela after an election generally recognized in and outside venezuela as rigged on the 11th the national assembly declares that according to the constitution the head of the national assembly was the interim president until legitimate elections could be conducted a growing number of reformers including many socialists believe guaidó is the legitimate interim president guaidó is a middle class engineer who had been protesting socialist rule for a decade was new to electoral politics when he became a candidate for parliament guaidó was one of the few middle class venezuelans who did not flee the country or plan to do so yet many of those who did leave kept in touch with those who did not and provided financial and other support as well as help in letting the world know what was really going on in venezuela the three million expatriate venezuelans played a key role in keeping democracy and resistance to the socialists alive by the end of january 2019 maduro was on the defensive unsure who in his government and especially the military would stand by him there were some public defections including an embassy official an army officer in the united states and a growing number of others there were regular mass pro guaidó demonstrations throughout the country and the government deliberately instructed the troops not to fire on the people this seemed to confirm the reports that while many officers still supported maduro many if not most of the troops and police did not there were practical reasons for this as the food shortages had become so bad in the last year that even soldiers and their families were going hungry this was largely due to corrupt officers because the military had control of the food distribution system since 2017 and a growing number of officers realized they could make a lot of money by diverting food supplies they controlled to the black market naturally many corrupt officers got greedy and not only were civilians going hungry but so were many troops this reminded soldiers that the pervasive corruption of the military and government was but the troops were still being fed and since the beginning of the year are receiving more food guaidó and the national assembly taking on maduro so directly was not a spur of the moment decision discussions within the national assembly and with expatriates had generated a lot of ideas and the declaration of a rival and more legitimate president of venezuela was one of many for that reason by the end of the month the united states has imposed sanctions on venezuelan oil since the u s is the largest customer for this oil and the main supplier of chemicals needed to make the venezuelan heavy crude usable these sanctions were a major blow to maduro but there was more american prosecutors began seizing american properties purchased with billions of dollars in stolen venezuelan oil money the u s and europe are the favorite places to try and launder and hide these stolen billions but maduro and his cronies failed to realize that chasing such dirty money had become increasingly popular throughout the west and it was much more difficult to get away with it these days there were plenty of existing databases of banking activity to use in hunting down what maduro associates were up to financially thus maduro was blocked from selling off more than two billion dollars worth of venezuelan gold reserves over a billion dollars of that gold in britain was transferred to the control of guaidó and the national assembly also the u s was seizing venezuelan assets in the united states and transferring them to the national assembly one of the first things guaidó did with this money was arrange for massive amounts of emergency food and medical supplies to be sent to venezuela maduro ordered troops to block roads at border crossings where the food was to enter the country his russian media advisors recommended that the food and medical aid was blocked because it was contaminated that backfired and is one reason maduro is increasingly concerned about the reliability of his troops at the same time guaidó is offering amnesty to officers and government officials who will abandon the maduro government and work with the national assembly the mass demonstrations continue and now maduro is concerned about the many criminal gangs he has on the payroll these men do the dirty work at the local level and are much less disciplined than the security forces maduro has few options and even fewer allies while venezuela has the largest oil reserves on the planet firing the effective managers of the state oil company and replacing them with socialist loyalists who often knew nothing about the oil business proved disastrous that had been going on for over a decade because of that production has declined along with oil prices and there is no way the socialist government can pump enough oil to finance its continued existence borrowing a lot of money from china backfired as well earlier in government hired cuba to provide technical advisors available to show the venezuelan socialists how to establish and maintain a long term dictatorship that did not work out because there was no money for it china cuba iran and russia are all present in venezuela and with all that oil as collateral the venezuelan socialists thought they had a safety net that would keep them in business that option is now gone and the maduro government is not only bankrupt and but unable to pump and ship enough oil to pay for food and other essential imports in theory china could rapidly expand its current efforts to rebuild the oil production facilities and also lend more billions to maduro for food and other supplies but china is unlikely to bankroll a longshot option like that guaidó has offered to respect deals already made with china in early february china made it clear that it was not taking sides in venezuela and would cooperate with whoever was in charge this came less than two weeks after juan guaido claimed he was the legal interim president of venezuela most western hemisphere nations and many european ones backed guaido as did most venezuelans the united states and eu nations are assisting guaido in taking control of billions of dollars in cash and other assets belonging to venezuela that are located in the u s and europe on the basis of all this guaido made it clear that he will respect current economic deals and is willing to work with russia and china currently venezuela s largest creditors maduro has the active support of cuba north korea iran and perhaps russia with allies like that you are in big trouble on january 28th the united states imposed oil sanctions on the venezuelan state oil company which is the only means china has to gets over 30 billion in venezuelan loans paid back this move encourages china to back juan guaido as the legitimate acting president of venezuela while guaido has made it clear he is willing to work with china it is only implied that the americans will go along with this in december 2018 chinese engineers and technicians in venezuela had control of about ten percent of venezuelan production the chinese have doubled production during 2018 in the areas they control and are hoping to expand that maduro was reluctant to go along with that because pdvsa the state owned oil company has become a refuge for government supporters who are more interested in stealing oil and remaining loyal to maduro than improving production the chinese have no police powers in venezuela but have a lot of financial clout which they believe will prevail in the long term china always felt that a more effective government would eventually emerge and allow businesses to operate efficiently and profitably once more china has been openly positioning itself as a friend of venezuela not the deranged socialists currently in charge china is still working on many development projects in venezuela and has plenty of experience doing so in lawless regions especially africa and northern burma it currently operates in the situation in venezuela is familiar to the chinese and they expect to come out of this with strong economic ties to the post chaos venezuela the national assembly appreciates that and is quietly trying to worth out arrangements with china to continue working with pdvsa once the maduro supporters are replaced a few days after guaido declared his claim to the presidency russia agreed to extend payment of venezuelan loans by ten years since 2017 venezuela has been unable to repay most of its foreign debt starting in 2006 russia has loaned venezuela 17 billion much of which russia won t say how much has not been repaid but since venezuela has not got the cash and given the current state of its economy will not have any additional cash anytime soon russia extended payments in return venezuela allowed russia to invest 6 billion in oil and gold mining projects in venezuela these projects probably won t begin until the venezuela economy recovers meaning not for a long time venezuela currently owes more than 120 billion to foreign lenders guaido is also negotiating with the russians who are inclined to follow the chinese lead in all this the national assembly is not talking to cuba the most dangerous ally of maduro cubans comprise key elements of maduro s personal security team cuban advisors are still active in the venezuelan intelligence and secret police operations cuba has much gain by helping maduro stay in charge and eventually revive the economy at one point the venezuelan socialists were providing cuba with financial aid that comprised about 20 percent of cuban gdp in return cuba supplied doctors and many other specialists since 2015 that aid to cuba has largely disappeared because maduro simply did not have the cash with the venezuelan income gone cuba is going through a major economic depression the same thing happened when russia halted its economic aid after 1991 cuba is still a communist dictatorship and attempting to revive its economy with free market reforms is difficult and painful but the cuban communists have managed to keep their police state functioning for 60 years and doing it without any natural resources like huge oil deposits this encourages maduro who ignores the fact that when the cuban communists took over in the late 1950s cuba had the most prosperous economy in the caribbean that soon disappeared moreover cuba is an island who had a stalwart nuclear ally russia from the start no one is willing to go nuclear in defense of cuba anymore and maduro has no such superpower backing for china venezuela is a business opportunity and the chinese are not pleased with the current management in venezuela since hugo chavez gained power in 1999 venezuela once the wealthiest country in the region has become one of the poorest less than twenty percent of the population are able to obtain adequate food and other commodities this fortunate fifth of the population consists largely of government loyalists or outlaws the fortunate fifth could easily be two fifths of venezuelans were it not for the massive corruption several families of senior leaders especially maduro and his mentor chavez have stolen billions of dollars in state funds meanwhile venezuela has become a police state with the major source of unrest food riots by starving venezuelans the government refuses to admit this is happening and blames any problems on other countries especially colombia and the united states that approach doesn t work as well as it used to because when chavez came to power two decades ago colombia was a mess economically and a scary place to live because of drug gangs and leftist rebels most of that has gone away and colombia with much less oil than venezuela is now the most prosperous nation in the region currently colombia has a gdp three times larger than venezuela s that has never happened before and it was not long ago that venezuela often had a gdp twice the size of colombia s prosperity and democracy died in venezuela because of nearly two decades of corruption and inept government created by hugo chavez this former soldier got elected in 1999 and died of cancer in march 2013 along the way chavez trashed the venezuelan economy and democracy his handpicked replacement nicolas maduro was even worse the old chavez dream of venezuela becoming a socialist dictatorship supported by oil revenue eventually faded along with cash reserves and the national credit rating venezuela currently owes over 50 billion for foreign lenders mainly in china and russia maduro has put a priority on making scheduled payments on that secured foreign debt because if they don t the credit rating is damaged while china and russia become less helpful that strategy failed and venezuela began to default on that debt in late 2017 the default continues making it nearly impossible to borrow money venezuela has the largest oil reserves of any nation on the planet but it also has one of the most corrupt ineffective lawless and clueless governments in the world venezuela has become a home base for drug cartels iranian islamic terrorists and chinese investors seeking a long term relationship drug gangs already exercise considerable power in venezuela and leftist rebels from colombia have moved in to exploit new opportunities no one not even major creditors china and russia want to intervene directly the neighbors do not want to intervene as that is not the accepted way of handling these things however the neighbors are faced with a choice of either intervening to deal with the chaos and violence or do nothing and wait for the chaos and violence to come visit at intolerable levels for a while it was believed there might be a military coup as there have already been minor outbreaks of violence or organized disobedience by the security forces whatever happens here during 2019 it is unlikely to be peaceful but venezuelans hope the changes will be an improvement over the current mess foreign and local economists agree that one of the key reasons for the economic crises in venezuela is the epic levels of corruption the 2018 international corruption ratings show the world that venezuela not making much progress dealing with that currently venezuela ranks 168th out of 180 nations compared with 169th in 2017 neighboring colombia was 99 out of 180 in 2011 venezuela was 162 out of 179 showing that the corruption was a cause not a result of the economic collapse corruption in the transparency international corruption perception index is measured on a 1 most corrupt to 100 not corrupt scale the most corrupt nations usually north korea 14 yemen 14 syria 13 south sudan 13 and somalia 10 have a rating of under 15 while of the least corrupt new zealand and denmark are over 85 the current venezuelan score is 18 same as in 2017 compared to 36 37 for colombia 35 37 for brazil 28 29 for mexico 63 61 for taiwan 40 40 for india 39 41 for china 29 29 for russia 40 39 for argentina 85 84 for singapore 72 73 for japan 67 67 for chile 33 32 for pakistan 34 32 for ecuador 28 30 for iran 16 15 for afghanistan 35 37 for peru 70 71 for the uae united arab emirates 62 64 for israel 72 75 for the united states 27 27 for nigeria 43 43 for south africa 18 18 for iraq 41 40 for turkey 49 49 for saudi arabia and 47 47 for cuba a lower corruption score is common with nations in economic trouble and problems dealing with reality and crime in general venezuela was not this corrupt before chavez took over but it took his socialist government over a decade to drive the corruption scores into the basement cuba on the other hand found it had to be reasonably lawful and incorrupt if it was to run any kind of free market economy maduro would have to do the same the national assembly members who remember what it was like to do business back when venezuela had a corruption score similar to its neighbors are better equipped to clean the mess up

ebitda is defined as net earnings attributable to common stockholders plus interest expense net income taxes and depreciation and amortization see reconciliations of ebitda and adjusted ebitda to the most directly comparable gaap measures in the tables accompanying this release 2 fourth quarter and full year 2017 net earnings attributable to common stockholders included a 491 million income tax benefit from the impact of the u s tax cuts and jobs act which impacted diluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders by 2 09 and 2 10 for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 respectively operations overview cf industries continued operating safely and efficiently during 2018 as of december 31 2018 the company s 12 month rolling average recordable incident rate was 0 60 incidents per 200 000 work hours despite increased turnaround and maintenance activity compared to 2017 sales overview net sales in the fourth quarter of 2018 were 1 132 million and for the full year 2018 were 4 429 million compared to 1 099 million and 4 130 million in the same periods last year the increases were due primarily to higher average selling prices across all segments total sales volumes for the fourth quarter and full year were lower compared to the same periods in 2017 as lower ammonia and ammonium nitrate sales volume was partially offset by higher granular urea sales volume average selling prices for the fourth quarter and full year 2018 were higher year over year across all segments as higher energy costs in asia and europe along with continued enforcement of environmental regulations in china resulted in lower production in these regions tightening the global supply and demand balance cost of sales for the full year 2018 decreased compared to the full year 2017 driven by lower sales volume and lower realized gas costs partially offset by higher costs related to plant turnarounds and maintenance the company also recorded an unrealized net mark to market gain on natural gas derivatives of 13 million for the full year 2018 compared to an unrealized net mark to market loss on natural gas derivatives of 61 million for the full year 2017 for the full year 2018 the average cost of natural gas reflected in the company s cost of sales was 3 16 per mmbtu which included a realized loss of 0 01 per mmbtu on natural gas hedges this compares to the average cost of natural gas in cost of sales of 3 40 per mmbtu for the full year 2017 which included a realized loss of 0 07 per mmbtu on natural gas hedges during 2018 the average price of natural gas at henry hub in north america was 3 12 per mmbtu and the average price of natural gas at the national balancing point in the united kingdom was 8 07 per mmbtu market overview global nitrogen prices reached in year highs early in the fourth quarter of 2018 and then declined through the end of the year and into 2019 due to seasonally low demand in the northern hemisphere and moderating energy prices in asia and europe as demand in the northern hemisphere begins to materialize industry fundamentals should be supportive of global nitrogen prices in the first half of 2019 in north america the company expects strong nitrogen fertilizer demand during the first half of 2019 corn and wheat plantings in the united states are projected to increase by four million and one million acres respectively compared to 2018 additionally unfavorable weather limited fall ammonia applications in the midwest united states suggesting a nitrogen deficit in many areas that will need to be made up by applications of ammonia or upgraded products during the first half of 2019 india and brazil two of the largest urea importing regions in the world will continue to be key global demand centers urea imports into india and brazil in 2018 totaled 6 3 million metric tons and 5 5 million metric tons respectively the company expects total indian and brazilian urea import requirements to be in a similar range in 2019 the company projects net global urea production capacity to increase by 3 5 million metric tons during 2019 below the historical nitrogen demand growth rate of two percent however 1 2 million metric tons of this new urea production capacity in iran that is included in the company s projection is at risk of delay due to united states sanctions on iran china s role in globally traded urea continued to shrink in 2018 with exports totaling approximately 2 4 million metric tons published reports suggest this volume may include substantial re exports of iranian urea chinese urea exports are expected to be in a similar volume range in 2019 due to continued firm energy prices and tighter environmental restrictions the company continues to monitor the impact of sanctions on iran urea from iranian producers is available at a significant discount to global prices with few regions of the world open to purchasing from that country due to sanctions iranian producers will face additional challenges should the sanctions continue due to the loss of access to technical expertise replacement parts for current plants and resources to support new construction longer term industry and energy market fundamentals are expected to continue to support the global nitrogen cost curve at higher levels net global urea supply growth through 2022 is projected to fall short of the historical nitrogen demand annual growth rate of approximately two percent further tightening the global supply and demand balance capital expenditures capital expenditures in 2019 are projected to be 400 450 million liquidity as of december 31 2018 the company had cash and cash equivalents of 682 million on the balance sheet had no borrowings outstanding under its 750 million
