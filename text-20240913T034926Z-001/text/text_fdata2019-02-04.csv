is it time for a breakout in gold first we need to define what a breakout actually is its when the price breaks a pattern or a range and a new trend is therefore established today people are all too quick to refer to almost every move higher as a breakout just google gold breakout and you ll see what i mean sure closing above 1300 was a breakout for gold but that s hardly significant if and when gold surpasses the wall resistance at 1350 1375 it will mark a real breakout the good news is gold is currently in a much better position both fundamentally and technically than it was in 2016 2017 and 2018 let me start with the technicals gold in real terms is stronger than at any other time in the past few years in the chart below we plot gold against foreign currencies fc stocks bonds and commodities the four vertical lines highlight the points when gold was testing its wall of resistance during 2017 through 2018 gold was driven mostly by a weak dollar in relative terms gold was weak against fc and stocks relative to summer 2016 gold is currently stronger against bonds and commodities and is inches away from testing its 2016 high against fc the last thing holding gold back is the stock market note that the gold to s p 500 ratio has not made a higher high in recent days while its holding above moving average support it desperately needs to make a higher high to confirm a new gold bull market is underway the performance of gold relative to the stock market is connected to the fundamentals for gold if the stock rally and economic data hold firm the fed could reintroduce rate hikes into the equation that s not a bullish scenario for gold it s important to keep this in mind on the other hand if the market is right the fed is done hiking rates and will make its first rate cut in 2020 that scenario eventually implies equity market weakness a push higher in the gold to stock market ratio and a breakout in gold so who should we trust the market or the fed who thinks they could hike this year the gold stocks are providing additional evidence they exploded above their 400 day moving averages and have shown strong breadth over the past two weeks at present the weight of the evidence is favoring bullish outcomes for precious metals ultimately if gold and gold stocks extend their outperformance against the stock market then look out for a breakout and a full blown bull market jordan roy byrne all the macro factors in place for a big run in gold gold markets were rocking on tuesday lifted by a basket of factors that included poor stock market performance earlier in the week slow growth in china weak earnings reports and expectations the us federal reserve would strike a dovish tone at its two day meeting starting on tuesday afternoon the fed raised interest rates four times in 2018 but some officials have signaled they are not expecting to continue raising rates this year as the us economy faces a number of pressures including the ongoing trade war with china the us government shutdown part 2 and waning consumer and business confidence indeed the doves were firmly in control on tuesday as spot gold rocketed past 1 300 an ounce to close at 1 311 66 in new york a 7 month high strength in the precious metal was buoyed by rising us china tensions after the justice department charged chinese tech company huawei and its chief financial officer earlier arrested and held in vancouver with fraud thus escalating trade tensions that have been ongoing for almost a year with billions in import tariffs levied from either side the us dollar index which typically moves in the opposite direction of gold was near a two month low tuesday at ahead of the herd we love gold and promising junior gold companies because gold holds its value through time owning gold is a way to preserve wealth against paper currencies which are subject to inflationary pressures and over time lose their value in the us there was an increase in inflation for every decade except the depression when prices shrunk nearly 20 between 1860 and 2015 the dollar experienced 2 6 inflation every year meaning that us 1 in 1860 was equivalent to 27 80 in 2015 this also means that prices in 2015 were 2 828 higher than they were in 1860 inflation gold investors love nothing more than a war economic crisis or any type of geopolitical instability to watch the value of their bullion grow heightened global tensions such as terrorist attacks border skirmishes or civil wars scare investors into putting their funds into safe havens like gold and stable high yield sovereign debt geopolitical tensions also drive more government spending eg on arms which brings inflation leading investors to look at precious metals as a place to park their money short term we also like gold because gold companies and explore cos are finding less of it all the easiest gold to mine has been found including gold found near surface and in underground veins we are now facing peak gold where gold production from here on will keep falling the experts agree the industry is seeing a significant slowdown in the number of large deposits being discovered it used to be that major gold miners were looking at 5 million ounce projects to buy and develop now they d be happy with a million ozs in the ground with gold production falling combined with a lack of large gold deposits that could move the market you have the setup for a continued rise in the gold price irrespective of what happens to investment demand for gold or gold jewelry affectionately known as the fear trade and the love trade taking a run through the headlines we find everything is in place for a big run up in gold the us dollar was on the rise last year causing gold prices to fall but this year the dollar is struggling weighed down in part by the us federal reserve s signal that it may stop raising interest rates and unwinding its balance sheet put in place to keep tightening monetary policy the central bank since october 2017 has been decreasing the size of its 4 5 trillion debt by allowing 50 billion to run off each month we are also looking at slowing global growth a worsening us economic outlook the size of the federal debt the fed possibly lowering interest rates to stimulate the economy and a rush to safe havens like gold due to escalating conflicts let s take each in turn sluggish growth when economies falter gold tends to well the big news here is china whose economy was booming at double digits for most of the 2000s but is now creeping along at just 6 5 in fourth quarter 2018 this is a normal expectation from a country that moved very rapidly to becoming an export driven economy with a low value currency to a more diversified one now however there are worrying signs in china about slack consumer spending on discretionary items like cars and phones chinese imports fell 7 6 in december after gaining 16 1 in 2017 exports are also hurting due to us tariffs on chinese goods but it s not just china while the imf has made a slight downward adjustment to its expected 4 global growth rate in 2019 yale economist stephen roach notes that it s worse than that examining the longer term trend he writes following a crisis induced plunge of 10 4 in the volume of global trade in 2009 a modern day record recovery has been muted after a brief two year rebound in 2010 2011 world trade growth averaged just 3 6 from 2012 to 2018 about half the 7 1 average annual pace in the 20 years before the crisis that combined with a surge in protectionism made apparent by the us china trade war and the anticipated negative fallout from britain leaving the european union has roach sounding a warning all in all the global trade cycle is facing major stress in 2019 and markdowns have only just begun this underscores the risks of a major shortfall in world gdp growth emerging markets better hope that the fed does move in a dovish rather than hawkish direction by keeping rates low according to fitch ratings latin america the middle east and africa will face more downgrades than upgrades to their debt ratings this year if interest rates and the dollar rise that s because these countries currencies have depreciated and they have a high share of their debt denominated in foreign currencies examples are turkey and argentina as the worst performing emerging market currency last year the argentine peso has 83 of its government debt in foreign currency bloomberg reported making it especially vulnerable to a dollar rise 47 of turkey s debt is foreign the lira fell 28 last year not so great again president donald trump took credit for the stock market run that prevailed for most of the last two years since his inauguration in january 2017 the continuation of the longest bull market in american history had even trump s opponents conceding things were going well until the market encountered a serious correction last september december was the worst month for us stock markets since the great depression and while markets are up since the start of the new year investor sentiment is weak and despite the economy barreling along at near full employment and inflation at a very reasonable 2 many economists are urging caution ahead one is j bradford delong an economics professor at the university of california at berkeley delong looked at previous recessions dating from 1825 when england s canal stock boom collapsed he found that the pattern for downturns is a flight to safety following a weakness in financial markets such as the collapse of the sub prime mortgage market in 2007 writing in project syndicate prof delong states needless to say the particular nature and form of the next financial shock will be unanticipated investors speculators and financial institutions are generally hedged against the foreseeable shocks but there will always be other contingencies that have been missed at any rate today s near inverted yield curve low nominal and real bond yields and equity values all suggest that us financial markets have begun to price in the likelihood of a recession assuming that business investment committees are thinking like investors and speculators all it will take now to bring on a recession is an event that triggers a retrenchment of investment spending if there is a meltdown like the housing market collapse that pre dated the financial crisis or the sudden shock of understated earnings that burst the dot com bubble expect gold the time honored safe haven to rally beyond the stock market there are other signs that all is not well in the land of the free as corporate earnings start to trickle in it s not looking good on monday caterpillar a heavy equipment manufacturer and nvidia a chipmaker both reported lower than expected fourth quarter earnings due to weakness in china caterpillar the world s largest maker of construction machinery is seen as a bellwether of us economic health then there s the debt bogeyman according to the congressional budget office as the stimulative effects of trump s tax cuts wane the increasing federal deficit projected at nearly 900 billion will weigh on growth reuters reports the cbo saying that economic growth will slow to 2 3 from 3 1 in 2018 more alarmingly whereas in 2007 total government debt was about 9 trillion 62 of gdp now it is approaching 22 trillion 100 of gdp corporate debt is at a record 46 of gdp this isn t just an american phenomenon though it s global after the financial crisis central banks in the us europe china and japan all lowered their interest rates in an effort to stimulate borrowing and economic activity they also injected massive amounts of liquidity into the system aka printing money through quantitative easing just over a year ago the fed started removing liquidity treasuries and mortgages to try to reduce the multi trillion dollar debt it had accumulated through qe in 2018 it raised interest rates four times and why not the us economy was running hot with no signs of problematic inflation and a healthy stock market china and europe also made moves to deleverage their debt central bank tightening has been blamed for killing the stock market rally last fall the problem is with everyone used to interest rates near zero over the last 10 years the world is mortgaged to the hilt global debt has gone from 113 trillion before the financial crisis to over 186 trillion why is this a problem because if interest rates rise even a little bit the higher interest on loans is going to hurt a lot especially the government which will have trouble servicing its own massive debt and more people and businesses will be locked out of borrowing as the canberra times describes the massive build up in global debt that the central government sought and encouraged developed with interest rates at unprecedented lows that means borrowers are exceptionally sensitive to increases in interest rates and decreases in the availability of credit after a decade of ultra loose monetary policies designed to encourage debt it isn t surprising that the world has gorged on it nor that now that the central banks are starting to reverse course markets and their participants are becoming nervous and more risk averse qe4 given its 22 trillion debt can the united states afford to raise rates any more with the pain that this higher cost of borrowing will entail long time fed critic peter schiff doesn t think so schiff the ceo of euro pacific capital thinks with debt levels so high the only way to finance it is to keep interest rates at ridiculously low levels everybody thinks that quantitative easing is over what they don t realize is it s barely begun the next round is going to be bigger than the first three and that s going to send gold to new highs schiff said at the new orleans investment conference on tuesday ronald peter stoeferle fund manager at incrementum ag and author of the in gold we trust report told kitco news he isn t surprised to see the central banking getting more dovish he agrees with schiff that rates are likely to come down central banks have tried to get out of this zero interest rate trap but they aren t able to the market is addicted to cheap liquidity and i don t think that is going to change anytime soon there is no way out for central banks caught in this trap he said gold does very well in this environment as the rich get richer another disturbing trend in the american economy that few people talk about is its growing inequality why is that important because as more people grow poorer fewer can participate in the economy like borrowing and spending money a study by the economic policy institute found that in 2015 five states 30 metro areas and 78 counties exceeded the previous national record for share of income by the richest 1 at 23 9 the previous record was set in 1929 other stats showing that economic growth in the united states is benefiting only the very rich the incomes of the top 1 grew faster than the 99 between 2009 and 2013 the 1 in 2015 had average household income of 421 926 this was exceeded by 13 states plus washington dc there has been slow wage growth in almost every part of the country over the past 45 years the us has more poor people than sierra leone and nepal 5 3 million americans are living under the poverty line including several million children who live on less than 2 a day the effects of this growing inequality in america is especially felt in urban areas where lower income residents and marginal businesses are being squeezed out of neighborhoods we see the same thing in vancouver it s a kind of reverse gentrification where only the top 10 can afford to live there if and when a recession hits these 10 ers will be hard hit businesses highly dependent on discretionary income like expensive coffee shops will go under in effect the top 10 is ripe for the disruptions of globalization and automation that have already laid waste to the bottom 90 writes charles hugh smith a blogger venezuela in crisis along with the conflict over huawei tuesday s gold rally was also underpinned by the return of safe haven demand particularly with respect to us tensions with venezuela and russia on monday the us sanctioned venezuela s state oil company the boldest action taken so far in the effort to isolate embattled president nicolas maduro the measure blocks about 7 billion in assets the trump administration last week recognized opposition leader juan guaido as the interim president and has called on the venezuelan military to get maduro to resign the country has been gripped with hyperinflation soaring unemployment and a mass exodus of refugees cnn reported it also looks increasingly likely that the us will pull out of a key nuclear disarmament agreement signed in the 1980s nato s 29 members are urging russia to destroy a nuclear capable cruise missile system before feb 2 failure to do so will put the us government on track for a threatened pull out of the 1987 imf treaty we have argued the breakdown of the imf treaty could be the catalyst that starts a new arms race between the united states russia and china as each projects military power in defense of spheres of influence outside their borders we are seeing this in the constant tension between the us and china in the south china sea and taiwan which china claims as its own and russian expansion into the ukraine and military support for syria while no one want to see the return of the nuclear threat if events escalate gold s safe haven status will kick in and we will see upward price pressure conclusion given that gold always pushes against the prevailing economic winds it appears likely that we could be in for an extended upleg in the price we are only now seeing the rot that has begun to set into the us economy the first clue was the stock market correction but others are coming forward as trump s 1 5 trillion tax cuts announced at year end 2017 finish percolating through the economy growth is predicted to stall we are already seeing disappointing corporate earnings especially from companies that sell into china which is also slowing down the trade war isn t helping unemployment is low but this is misleading many americans are working dead end jobs or are employed part time the gap between rich and poor is widening most importantly for gold the tightening cycle appears to have stalled with record debt on the books the central bank has very limited leeway in how fast and far it can raise interest rates if we are heading into a recession as some predict the fed may have no choice but to once again lower rates to stimulate the economy as it did in 2011 bad economic times ahead means

for some the crisis in venezuela is all about the endemic corruption of nicolás maduro continuing the broken legacy of chavez s ideological experiment in socialism under the mounting insidious influence of putin for others it s all about the ongoing counter democratic meddling of the united states which has for years wanted to bring venezuela with its huge oil reserves back into the orbit of american power and is now interfering again to undermine a democratically elected leader in latin america neither side truly understands the real driving force behind the collapse of venezuela we have moved into the twilight of the age of oil so how does a country like venezuela with the largest reserves of crude oil in the world end up incapable of developing them while various elements of socialism corruption and neoliberal capitalism are all implicated in various ways what no one s talking about especially the global oil industry is that over the last decade we ve shifted into a new era the world has moved from largely extracting cheap easy crude to becoming increasingly dependent on unconventional forms of oil and gas that are much more difficult and expensive to produce oil isn t running out in fact it s everywhere we ve more than enough to fry the planet but as the easy cheap stuff has plateaued production costs have soared and as a consequence the most expensive oil to produce has become increasingly unprofitable in a country like venezuela emerging from a history of us interference plagued by internal economic mismanagement combined with external intensifying pressure from us sanctions this decline in profitability became fatal since hugo chavez s election in 1999 the us has continued to explore numerous ways to interfere in and undermine his socialist government this is consistent with the track record of us overt and covert interventionism across latin america which has sought to overthrow democratically elected governments which undermine us interests in the region supported right wing autocratic regimes and funded trained and armed far right death squads complicit in wantonly massacring hundreds of thousands of people for all the triumphant moralising in parts of the western media about the failures of venezuela s socialist experiment there has been little reflection on the role of this horrific counter democratic us foreign policy in paving the way for a populist hunger for nationalist and independent alternatives to us backed cronyism before chavez venezuela used to be a dream us ally model free market economy and a major oil producer with the largest reserves of crude oil in the world the conventional narrative is that its current implosion can only be due to colossal mismanagement of its domestic resources described back in 1990 by the new york times as one of latin america s oldest and most stable democracies the newspaper of record predicted that thanks to the geopolitical volatility of the middle east venezuela is poised to play a newly prominent role in the united states energy scene well into the 1990 s at the time venezuelan oil production was helping to offset the shortage caused by the embargo of oil from iraq and kuwait amidst higher oil prices triggered by the simmering conflict but the nyt had camouflaged a deepening economic crisis as noted by leading expert on latin america javier corrales in revista harvard review of latin america venezuela had never recovered from currency and debt crises it had experienced in the 1980s economic chaos continued well into the 1990s just as the times had celebrated the market economy s friendship with the us explained corrales inflation remained indomitable and among the highest in the region economic growth continued to be volatile and oil dependent growth per capita stagnated unemployment rates surged and public sector deficits endured despite continuous spending cutbacks prior to the ascension of chavez the entrenched party political system so applauded by the us and courted by international institutions like the imf was essentially crumbling according to a recent report by data information resources to the venezuelan american chamber of commerce in the last 25 years the share of household income spent on food has shot up to 72 percent from 28 percent lamented the new york times in 1996 the middle class has shrunk by a third an estimated 53 percent of jobs are now classified as informal in the underground economy as compared with 33 percent in the late 1970 s the nyt piece cynically put all the blame for the deepening crisis on government largesse and interventionism in the economy but even here within the subtext the paper acknowledged a historical backdrop of consistent imf backed austerity measures according to the nyt even the ostensibly anti austerity president rafael caldera who had promised more state financed populism as an antidote to years of imf wrought austerity ended up negotiating for a 3 billion loan from the imf along with a second loan of undisclosed size to ease the social impact of any hardships imposed by an imf agreement so it is convenient that today s loud and self righteous moral denunciations of maduro ignore the instrumental role played by us efforts to impose market fundamentalism in wreaking economic and social havoc across venezuelan society of course outside the fanatical echo chambers of the trump white house and the likes of the new york times the devastating impact of us backed world bank and imf austerity measures is well documented among serious economists in a paper for the london school of economics development economist professor jonathan dijohn of the un research institute for social development found that us backed economic liberalisation not only failed to revive private investment and economic growth but also contributed to a worsening of the factorial distribution of income which contributed to growing polarisation of politics neoliberal reforms further compounded already existing centralised nepotistic political structures vulnerable to corruption far from strengthening the state they led to a collapse in the state s regulative power analysts who hark back to a venezuelan free market golden age ignore the fact that far from reducing corruption financial deregulation large scale privatisations and private monopolies create large rents and thus rent seeking corruption opportunities instead of leading to meaningful economic reforms neoliberalisation stymied genuine reform and entrenched elite power and this is precisely how the west helped create the chavez it loves to hate in the words of corrales in the harvard review economic collapse and party system collapse are intimately related venezuela s repeated failure to reform its economy made existing politicians increasingly unpopular who in turn responded by privileging populist policies over real reforms the result was a vicious cycle of economic and political party decay ultimately paving the way for the rise of chavez dead oil while it is now fashionable to blame the collapse of the venezuelan oil industry solely on chavez s socialism caldera s privatisation of the oil sector was unable to forestall the decline in oil production which peaked in 1997 at around 3 5 million barrels a day by 1999 chavez s first actual year in office production had already dropped dramatically by around 30 percent a deeper look reveals that the causes of venezuela s oil problems are slightly more complicated than the chávez killed it meme since peaking around 1997 venezuelan oil production has declined over the last two decades but in recent years has experienced a precipitous fall there can be little doubt that serious mismanagement in the oil industry has played a role in this decline however there is a fundamental driver other than mismanagement which the press has consistently ignored in reporting on venezuala s current crisis the increasingly fraught economics of oil the vast bulk of venezuela s oil is not conventional crude but unconventional heavy oil a highly viscous liquid that requires unconventional techniques to extract and flow often with heat from steam and or mixing it with lighter forms of crude in the refining process heavy oil thus has a higher cost of extraction than normal crude and a lower market price due to the refining difficulties in theory heavy oil can be produced at below break even prices to a profit but greater investment is still needed to get to that point the higher costs of extraction and refining have played a key role in making venezuela s oil production efforts increasingly unprofitable and unsustainable when oil prices were at their height between 2005 and 2008 venezuela was able to weather the inefficiencies and mismanagement in its oil industry due to much higher profits thanks to prices between 100 and 150 a barrel global oil prices were spiking as global conventional crude oil production began to plateau causing an increasing shift to unconventional sources that global shift did not mean that oil was running out but that we were moving deeper into dependence on more difficult and expensive forms of unconventional oil and gas the shift can be best understood through the concept of energy return on investment eroi pioneered principally by the state university of new york environmental scientist professor charles hall a ratio which measures how much energy is used to extract a particular quantity of energy from any resource hall has shown that as we are consuming ever larger quantities of energy we are using more and more energy to do so leaving less surplus energy at the end to underpin social and economic activity this creates a counter intuitive dynamic even as production soars the quality of the energy we are producing declines its costs are higher industry profits are squeezed and the surplus available to sustain continued economic growth dwindles as the surplus energy available to sustain economic growth is squeezed in real terms the biophysical capacity of the economy to continue buying the very oil being produced reduces economic recession partly induced by the previous era of oil price spikes interacts with the lack of affordability of oil leading the market price to collapse that in turn renders the most expensive unconventional oil and gas projects potentially unprofitable unless they can find ways to cover their losses through external subsidies of some kind such as government grants or extended lines of credit and this is the key difference between venezuela and countries like the us and canada where extremely low eroi levels for production have been sustained largely through massive multi billion dollar loans fuelling an energy boom that is likely to come to a catastrophic endwhen the debt turkey comes home to roost it s all a bit reminiscent of the dot com bubble of the late 1990s when internet companies were valued on the number of eyeballs they attracted not on the profits they were likely to make wrote bethany mclean recently once again in the new york times a us journalist well known for her work on the enron collapse as long as investors were willing to believe that profits were coming it all worked until it didn t a number of scientists have previously estimated the eroi of heavy oil production to amount to around 9 1 with room for variation up or down depending on how inputs are accounted for and calculated the unfashionable but probably more accurate approach would be downwards closer to 6 1 when both direct and indirect energy costs are considered compare this to the eroi of about 20 1 for conventional crude prior to 2000 which gives an indication of the challenge venezuela faced which unlike the us and canada had emerged into the chavez era from a history of neoliberal devastation and debt expansion that already made further investments or subsidies to venezuela s oil industry a difficult ask venezuela in that sense was ill prepared to adapt to the post 2014 oil price collapse compared to its wealthier western competitors in other forms of unconventional oil and gas to be sure then the collapse of venezuela s oil industry cannot be reduced to geological factors though there can be little doubt that those factors and their economic ramifications tend to be underplayed in conventional explanations above ground factors were clearly a major problem in terms of chronic inadequacy of investment and the resulting degradation of production infrastructure a balanced picture thus has to acknowledge both that venezuela s vast reserves are far more expensive and difficult to bring to market than standard conventional oil and that venezuala s very specific economic circumstances in the wake of decades of failed imf austerity put the country in an extremely weak position to keep its oil show on the road since 2008 oil production has declined by more than 350 000 barrels per day and more than 800 000 per day since its peak level in 1997 this has driven the collapse of net exports by over 1 1 million barrels per day since 1998 meanwhile to sustain refining of heavy oil venezuela has increasingly imported light oil to blend with heavy oil as well as for domestic consumption currently only extra heavy oil production in the orinoco oil belt has been able to increase while conventional oil production continues to rapidly decline despite significant proved conventional reserves these still require more expensive enhanced recovery techniques and infrastructure investments which are unavailable but profit margins from exports of extra heavy crude are much smaller due to the higher costs of blending upgrading and transportation and the heavy discounts in international refining markets in summary oil industry expert professor francisco monaldi at the center for energy and the environment at iesa in venezuela concludes oil production in venezuela is comprised of increasingly heavier oil and thus less profitable pdvsa s operated production is falling more rapidly and the production that generates cash flow is almost half of the total production these trends were problematic enough at peak oil prices but with prices falling they become much more acute the folly of endless growth unfortunately much like his predecessors chavez didn t appreciate the complexities let alone the biophysical economics of the oil industry rather he saw it simplistically through the short term lens of his own ideological socialist experiment from 1998 until his death in 2013 chavez s application of what he called socialism to the oil industry succeeded in reducing poverty from 55 to 34 percent helped 1 5 million adults become literate and delivered healthcare to 70 percent of the population with cuban doctors all this apparent progress was enabled by oil revenues but it was an unsustainable pipe dream instead of investing oil revenues back into production chavez spent them away on his social programmes during the heyday of the oil price spikes with no thought to the industry he was drawing from and in the mistaken belief that prices would stay high by the time prices collapsed due to the global shift to difficult oil described earlier reducing venezuala s state revenues 96 percent of which come from oil chavez had no currency reserves to fall back on chavez had thus dramatically compounded the legacy of problems he had been left with he had mimicked the same mistake made by the west before 2008 pursuing a path of progress based on an unsustainable consumption of resources fuelled by debt and bound to come crashing down so when he ran out of oil money he did what governments effectively did worldwide after the 2008 financial crash through quantitative easing he simply printed money the immediate impact was to drive up inflation he simultaneously fixed the exchange rate to dollars hiked up the minimum wage while forcing prices of staple goods like bread to stay low this of course turned businesses selling such staple goods or involved at every chain in their production into unprofitable enterprises which could no longer afford to pay their own employees due to haemorrhaging income levels meanwhile he slashed subsidies to farmers and other industries while imposing quotas on them to maintain production instead of producing the desired result many businesses ended up selling their goods on the black market in an attempt to make a profit as the economic crisis escalated and as oil production declined chavez pinned his hopes on the potential transformation that could be ushered in by massive state investment in a new type of economy based on nationalised self or cooperatively managed industries those investments too had little results dr asa cusack an expert on venezuela at the london school of economics points out that even though the number of cooperatives exploded in practice they were often as inefficient corrupt nepotistic and exploitative as the private sector that they were supposed to displace meanwhile with its currency reserves depleted the government has had to slash imports by over 65 percent since 2012 while simultaneously reducing social spending to even lower than it was under imf austerity reforms in the 1990s chavistan crisis driven socialism began with unsustainable social spending and has now switched to catastrophic levels of austerity that make neoliberalism look timid in this context the rise of the black market and organised crime exploited by both the government and the opposition became a way of life while the economy food production health care and basic infrastructure collapsed with frightening speed and ferocity climate wild cards amidst this perfect storm the wild card of climate impacts pushed venezuela over the edge accelerating an already dizzying spiral of crises in march 2018 on the back of hyperinflation and recession the government enforced electricity rationing across six western states in one state san cristobal residents reported 14 hour stretches without power after water levels in reservoirs used for hydroelectric plants were reduced due to drought a similar crisis had erupted two years earlier when water levels behind the guri dam which provides well over half the country s electricity hit record lows venezuela generates around 65 percent of its electricity from hydropower with a view to leave as much oil available as possible for export but this has made electricity supplies increasingly vulnerable to droughts induced by climate change impacts it is well known that the el nino southern oscillation the biggest fluctuation in the earth s climate system comprising a cycle of warm and cold sea surface temperatures in the tropical pacific ocean is increasing in frequency and intensity due to climate change a new study on the impact of climate change in venezuela finds that between 1950 and 2004 12 out of 15 el nino events coincided with years in which mean annual flow of water in the caroni river basin affecting the guri reservoir and hydroelectric power was smaller than the historical mean from 2013 to 2016 an intensified el nino cycle meant that there was little rain in venezuela culminating in a crippling deficit in 2015 it was the worst drought in almost half a century in the country severely straining the country s aging and poorly managed energy grid resulting in rolling blackouts according to professor juan carlos sanchez a co recipient of the 2007 nobel peace prize for his work with intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc these trends will dramatically deteriorate under a business as usual scenario large areas of venezuelan states which are already water scarce such as falcon sucre lara and zulia including the north of the guajira peninsula will undergo desertification land degradation and decreased rainfall would devastate production of corn black beans and plantains across much of the country sanchez predicts that some regions of the country will receive 25 percent less water than today and that means even less electricity by mid century climate models indicate an overall 18 percent decrease in rainfall in the caroni river basin that leads to the guri dam unfortunately no venezuelan government has ever taken seriously its climate pledges preferring to escalate as much as possible its oil production and even intensifying the co2 intensive practice of gas flaring meanwhile escalating climate change is set to exacerbate venezuela s electricity blackouts infrastructure collapse and agricultural crisis economic war the crisis convergence unfolding in venezuela gives us a window into what can happen when a post oil future is foisted upon you as domestic energy supplies dwindle the state s capacity to function recedes in unprecedented ways opening the way for state failure as the state collapses new smaller centres of power emerge competing for control of diminishing resources in this context reports of food trafficking as a mechanism of economic war are real but they are not exclusive to either political side all sides have become incentivised to horde products and sell them on the black market as a direct result of the collapsing economy retrograde government price controls and wildly speculative prices venezuelan state owned media have pinpointed cases where private companies engaged in hoarding have close ties to the opposition in response the government has appropriated vast assets farmland bakeries other businesses but has failed to lift production on the other hand katiuska rodriguez a journalist investigating shortages at el nacional a pro opposition newspaper said that there is little clear evidence of hoarding being a result of an economic war by capitalist business elites against the government although real she explained hoarding is driven largely by commercial interests in survival and yet there is mounting evidence that the maduro government is complicit in not just hoarding but mass embezzlement of public funds sociologist chris carlson of the city university of new york graduate center points outthat a number of former senior chavista government officials have come on record to confirm how powerful elites within the government have exploited the crisis to extract huge profits for themselves a gang was created that was only interested in getting their hands on the oil revenue said hector navarro former chavista minister and socialist party leader similarly chavez s former finance minister jorge giordani estimated that some 300 billion was embezzled in this way and yet the real economic war is not really going on inside venezuela it has been conducted by the us against venezuela through a draconian sanctions regime which has exacerbated the arc of collapse francisco rodriguez chief economist at torino economics in new york points out that a major drop in venezuela s production numbers occurred precisely at the time at which the united states decided to impose financial sanctions on venezuela he argues that advocates of sanctions on venezuela claim that these target the maduro regime but do not affect the venezuelan people if the sanctions regime can be linked to the deterioration of the country s export capacity and to its consequent import and growth collapse then this claim is clearly wrong rodriguez marshals a range of evidence suggesting this might well be the case others with direct expertise have gone further former un special rapporteur to venezuela alfred de zayas who finished his term at the un in march 2018 criticised the us for engaging in economic warfare against venezuela on his fact finding mission to the country in late 2017 he confirmed the role of overdependence on oil poor governance and corruption but blamed the us eu and canadian sanctions for worsening the economic crisis and killing venezuelans us goals are fairly transparent in an interview with fox news that has been completely ignored by the press trump s national security advisor john bolton explained the focus of us attention we re looking at the oil assets that s the single most important income stream to the government of venezuela we re looking at what to do to that he continued we re in conversation with major american companies now i think we re trying to get to the same end result here it will make a big difference to the united states economically if we could have american oil companies really invest in and produce the oil capabilities in venezuela the coming oil crisis it is not entirely surprising that bolton is particularly eager at this time to extend us energy companies into venezuela north american exploration and production companies have seen their net debt balloon from 50 billion in 2005 to nearly 200 billion by 2015 industry doesn t make money it s on much shakier financial footing than most people realize said mclean who has just authored the book saudi america the truth about fracking and how it s changing the world indeed there is serious gulf between oil industry claims about opportunities for profit and what is actually happening in those companies when you look at oil companies presentations there s something that doesn t make sense because they show their investors these beautiful investor decks with gorgeous slides indicating that they will produce an 80 or 60 internal rate of return and then you go to the corporate level and you see that the company isn t making money and you wonder what happened between point a and point b in short cheap debt money has permitted the industry to grow but how long that can continue is an open question part of the point in writing my book was just to make people aware that as we trump at american energy independence let s think about some of the foundation of this and how insecure it actually is so that we re also planning for the future in different ways adds mclean indeed us shale oil and gas production is forecast to peak in around a decade or in as little as four years it s not just the us europe as a continent is already well into the post peak phase and russian oil ministry officials privately anticipate an imminent peak within the next few years as china india and other asian powers experience further demand growth everyone will be looking increasingly for a viable energy supply whether from the middle east or latin america but it won t come cheap or easy and it won t be healthy for the planet whatever their ultimate causes the horrifying collapse of venezuela heralds insights into a possible future for today s major oil producers including the united states the us is enjoying a revival in its oil industry but how long it will last and how sustainable it is are awkward questions that few pundits dare to ask except a brave few such as mclean this does not necessarily mean oil production will simply slowly grind to a halt as production limits are reached using current techniques new techniques might be brought into play to try to mine vast reserves of more difficult resources however whatever technological innovations emerge they are unlikely to be able to avert the trajectory of increasing costs of extraction refining and processing before getting fossil fuels to market and this means that the surplus energy available to devote to the delivery of public goods familiar to modern industrial consumerist societies will become smaller and smaller meanwhile the environmental consequences of fossil fuel dependency are making investors re think the financial viability of these industries creating a growing risk that they become stranded assets in this emerging future the trajectory of endless economic growth as we know it cannot continue either way the warnings signs are unmistakeable as we shift into a post carbon era we will have to adapt new economic thinking and restructure our ways of life from the ground up right now the venezuelan people find themselves locked into a vicious cycle of ill conceived human systems collapsing into violent in fighting in the face of the earth system crisis erupting beneath them it is not yet too late for the rest of the world to learn a lesson we can either be dragged into a world after oil kicking and screaming or we can roll up our sleeves and walk there in a manner of our own choosing it really is up to us venezuela should function as a warning sign as to what can happen when we bury our heads in the oil sands
for some the crisis in venezuela is all about the endemic corruption of nicolás maduro continuing the broken legacy of chavez s ideological experiment in socialism under the mounting insidious influence of putin for others it s all about the ongoing counter democratic meddling of the united states which has for years wanted to bring venezuela with its huge oil reserves back into the orbit of american power and is now interfering again to undermine a democratically elected leader in latin america neither side truly understands the real driving force behind the collapse of venezuela we have moved into the twilight of the age of oil so how does a country like venezuela with the largest reserves of crude oil in the world end up incapable of developing them while various elements of socialism corruption and neoliberal capitalism are all implicated in various ways what no one s talking about especially the global oil industry is that over the last decade we ve shifted into a new era the world has moved from largely extracting cheap easy crude to becoming increasingly dependent on unconventional forms of oil and gas that are much more difficult and expensive to produce oil isn t running out in fact it s everywhere we ve more than enough to fry the planet but as the easy cheap stuff has plateaued production costs have soared and as a consequence the most expensive oil to produce has become increasingly unprofitable in a country like venezuela emerging from a history of us interference plagued by internal economic mismanagement combined with external intensifying pressure from us sanctions this decline in profitability became fatal since hugo chavez s election in 1999 the us has continued to explore numerous ways to interfere in and undermine his socialist government this is consistent with the track record of us overt and covert interventionism across latin america which has sought to overthrow democratically elected governments which undermine us interests in the region supported right wing autocratic regimes and funded trained and armed far right death squads complicit in wantonly massacring hundreds of thousands of people for all the triumphant moralising in parts of the western media about the failures of venezuela s socialist experiment there has been little reflection on the role of this horrific counter democratic us foreign policy in paving the way for a populist hunger for nationalist and independent alternatives to us backed cronyism before chavez venezuela used to be a dream us ally model free market economy and a major oil producer with the largest reserves of crude oil in the world the conventional narrative is that its current implosion can only be due to colossal mismanagement of its domestic resources described back in 1990 by the new york times as one of latin america s oldest and most stable democracies the newspaper of record predicted that thanks to the geopolitical volatility of the middle east venezuela is poised to play a newly prominent role in the united states energy scene well into the 1990 s at the time venezuelan oil production was helping to offset the shortage caused by the embargo of oil from iraq and kuwait amidst higher oil prices triggered by the simmering conflict but the nyt had camouflaged a deepening economic crisis as noted by leading expert on latin america javier corrales in revista harvard review of latin america venezuela had never recovered from currency and debt crises it had experienced in the 1980s economic chaos continued well into the 1990s just as the times had celebrated the market economy s friendship with the us explained corrales inflation remained indomitable and among the highest in the region economic growth continued to be volatile and oil dependent growth per capita stagnated unemployment rates surged and public sector deficits endured despite continuous spending cutbacks prior to the ascension of chavez the entrenched party political system so applauded by the us and courted by international institutions like the imf was essentially crumbling according to a recent report by data information resources to the venezuelan american chamber of commerce in the last 25 years the share of household income spent on food has shot up to 72 percent from 28 percent lamented the new york times in 1996 the middle class has shrunk by a third an estimated 53 percent of jobs are now classified as informal in the underground economy as compared with 33 percent in the late 1970 s the nyt piece cynically put all the blame for the deepening crisis on government largesse and interventionism in the economy but even here within the subtext the paper acknowledged a historical backdrop of consistent imf backed austerity measures according to the nyt even the ostensibly anti austerity president rafael caldera who had promised more state financed populism as an antidote to years of imf wrought austerity ended up negotiating for a 3 billion loan from the imf along with a second loan of undisclosed size to ease the social impact of any hardships imposed by an imf agreement so it is convenient that today s loud and self righteous moral denunciations of maduro ignore the instrumental role played by us efforts to impose market fundamentalism in wreaking economic and social havoc across venezuelan society of course outside the fanatical echo chambers of the trump white house and the likes of the new york times the devastating impact of us backed world bank and imf austerity measures is well documented among serious economists in a paper for the london school of economics development economist professor jonathan dijohn of the un research institute for social development found that us backed economic liberalisation not only failed to revive private investment and economic growth but also contributed to a worsening of the factorial distribution of income which contributed to growing polarisation of politics neoliberal reforms further compounded already existing centralised nepotistic political structures vulnerable to corruption far from strengthening the state they led to a collapse in the state s regulative power analysts who hark back to a venezuelan free market golden age ignore the fact that far from reducing corruption financial deregulation large scale privatisations and private monopolies create large rents and thus rent seeking corruption opportunities instead of leading to meaningful economic reforms neoliberalisation stymied genuine reform and entrenched elite power and this is precisely how the west helped create the chavez it loves to hate in the words of corrales in the harvard review economic collapse and party system collapse are intimately related venezuela s repeated failure to reform its economy made existing politicians increasingly unpopular who in turn responded by privileging populist policies over real reforms the result was a vicious cycle of economic and political party decay ultimately paving the way for the rise of chavez dead oil while it is now fashionable to blame the collapse of the venezuelan oil industry solely on chavez s socialism caldera s privatisation of the oil sector was unable to forestall the decline in oil production which peaked in 1997 at around 3 5 million barrels a day by 1999 chavez s first actual year in office production had already dropped dramatically by around 30 percent a deeper look reveals that the causes of venezuela s oil problems are slightly more complicated than the chávez killed it meme since peaking around 1997 venezuelan oil production has declined over the last two decades but in recent years has experienced a precipitous fall there can be little doubt that serious mismanagement in the oil industry has played a role in this decline however there is a fundamental driver other than mismanagement which the press has consistently ignored in reporting on venezuala s current crisis the increasingly fraught economics of oil the vast bulk of venezuela s oil is not conventional crude but unconventional heavy oil a highly viscous liquid that requires unconventional techniques to extract and flow often with heat from steam and or mixing it with lighter forms of crude in the refining process heavy oil thus has a higher cost of extraction than normal crude and a lower market price due to the refining difficulties in theory heavy oil can be produced at below break even prices to a profit but greater investment is still needed to get to that point the higher costs of extraction and refining have played a key role in making venezuela s oil production efforts increasingly unprofitable and unsustainable when oil prices were at their height between 2005 and 2008 venezuela was able to weather the inefficiencies and mismanagement in its oil industry due to much higher profits thanks to prices between 100 and 150 a barrel global oil prices were spiking as global conventional crude oil production began to plateau causing an increasing shift to unconventional sources that global shift did not mean that oil was running out but that we were moving deeper into dependence on more difficult and expensive forms of unconventional oil and gas the shift can be best understood through the concept of energy return on investment eroi pioneered principally by the state university of new york environmental scientist professor charles hall a ratio which measures how much energy is used to extract a particular quantity of energy from any resource hall has shown that as we are consuming ever larger quantities of energy we are using more and more energy to do so leaving less surplus energy at the end to underpin social and economic activity this creates a counter intuitive dynamic even as production soars the quality of the energy we are producing declines its costs are higher industry profits are squeezed and the surplus available to sustain continued economic growth dwindles as the surplus energy available to sustain economic growth is squeezed in real terms the biophysical capacity of the economy to continue buying the very oil being produced reduces economic recession partly induced by the previous era of oil price spikes interacts with the lack of affordability of oil leading the market price to collapse that in turn renders the most expensive unconventional oil and gas projects potentially unprofitable unless they can find ways to cover their losses through external subsidies of some kind such as government grants or extended lines of credit and this is the key difference between venezuela and countries like the us and canada where extremely low eroi levels for production have been sustained largely through massive multi billion dollar loans fuelling an energy boom that is likely to come to a catastrophic endwhen the debt turkey comes home to roost it s all a bit reminiscent of the dot com bubble of the late 1990s when internet companies were valued on the number of eyeballs they attracted not on the profits they were likely to make wrote bethany mclean recently once again in the new york times a us journalist well known for her work on the enron collapse as long as investors were willing to believe that profits were coming it all worked until it didn t a number of scientists have previously estimated the eroi of heavy oil production to amount to around 9 1 with room for variation up or down depending on how inputs are accounted for and calculated the unfashionable but probably more accurate approach would be downwards closer to 6 1 when both direct and indirect energy costs are considered compare this to the eroi of about 20 1 for conventional crude prior to 2000 which gives an indication of the challenge venezuela faced which unlike the us and canada had emerged into the chavez era from a history of neoliberal devastation and debt expansion that already made further investments or subsidies to venezuela s oil industry a difficult ask venezuela in that sense was ill prepared to adapt to the post 2014 oil price collapse compared to its wealthier western competitors in other forms of unconventional oil and gas to be sure then the collapse of venezuela s oil industry cannot be reduced to geological factors though there can be little doubt that those factors and their economic ramifications tend to be underplayed in conventional explanations above ground factors were clearly a major problem in terms of chronic inadequacy of investment and the resulting degradation of production infrastructure a balanced picture thus has to acknowledge both that venezuela s vast reserves are far more expensive and difficult to bring to market than standard conventional oil and that venezuala s very specific economic circumstances in the wake of decades of failed imf austerity put the country in an extremely weak position to keep its oil show on the road since 2008 oil production has declined by more than 350 000 barrels per day and more than 800 000 per day since its peak level in 1997 this has driven the collapse of net exports by over 1 1 million barrels per day since 1998 meanwhile to sustain refining of heavy oil venezuela has increasingly imported light oil to blend with heavy oil as well as for domestic consumption currently only extra heavy oil production in the orinoco oil belt has been able to increase while conventional oil production continues to rapidly decline despite significant proved conventional reserves these still require more expensive enhanced recovery techniques and infrastructure investments which are unavailable but profit margins from exports of extra heavy crude are much smaller due to the higher costs of blending upgrading and transportation and the heavy discounts in international refining markets in summary oil industry expert professor francisco monaldi at the center for energy and the environment at iesa in venezuela concludes oil production in venezuela is comprised of increasingly heavier oil and thus less profitable pdvsa s operated production is falling more rapidly and the production that generates cash flow is almost half of the total production these trends were problematic enough at peak oil prices but with prices falling they become much more acute the folly of endless growth unfortunately much like his predecessors chavez didn t appreciate the complexities let alone the biophysical economics of the oil industry rather he saw it simplistically through the short term lens of his own ideological socialist experiment from 1998 until his death in 2013 chavez s application of what he called socialism to the oil industry succeeded in reducing poverty from 55 to 34 percent helped 1 5 million adults become literate and delivered healthcare to 70 percent of the population with cuban doctors all this apparent progress was enabled by oil revenues but it was an unsustainable pipe dream instead of investing oil revenues back into production chavez spent them away on his social programmes during the heyday of the oil price spikes with no thought to the industry he was drawing from and in the mistaken belief that prices would stay high by the time prices collapsed due to the global shift to difficult oil described earlier reducing venezuala s state revenues 96 percent of which come from oil chavez had no currency reserves to fall back on chavez had thus dramatically compounded the legacy of problems he had been left with he had mimicked the same mistake made by the west before 2008 pursuing a path of progress based on an unsustainable consumption of resources fuelled by debt and bound to come crashing down so when he ran out of oil money he did what governments effectively did worldwide after the 2008 financial crash through quantitative easing he simply printed money the immediate impact was to drive up inflation he simultaneously fixed the exchange rate to dollars hiked up the minimum wage while forcing prices of staple goods like bread to stay low this of course turned businesses selling such staple goods or involved at every chain in their production into unprofitable enterprises which could no longer afford to pay their own employees due to haemorrhaging income levels meanwhile he slashed subsidies to farmers and other industries while imposing quotas on them to maintain production instead of producing the desired result many businesses ended up selling their goods on the black market in an attempt to make a profit as the economic crisis escalated and as oil production declined chavez pinned his hopes on the potential transformation that could be ushered in by massive state investment in a new type of economy based on nationalised self or cooperatively managed industries those investments too had little results dr asa cusack an expert on venezuela at the london school of economics points out that even though the number of cooperatives exploded in practice they were often as inefficient corrupt nepotistic and exploitative as the private sector that they were supposed to displace meanwhile with its currency reserves depleted the government has had to slash imports by over 65 percent since 2012 while simultaneously reducing social spending to even lower than it was under imf austerity reforms in the 1990s chavistan crisis driven socialism began with unsustainable social spending and has now switched to catastrophic levels of austerity that make neoliberalism look timid in this context the rise of the black market and organised crime exploited by both the government and the opposition became a way of life while the economy food production health care and basic infrastructure collapsed with frightening speed and ferocity climate wild cards amidst this perfect storm the wild card of climate impacts pushed venezuela over the edge accelerating an already dizzying spiral of crises in march 2018 on the back of hyperinflation and recession the government enforced electricity rationing across six western states in one state san cristobal residents reported 14 hour stretches without power after water levels in reservoirs used for hydroelectric plants were reduced due to drought a similar crisis had erupted two years earlier when water levels behind the guri dam which provides well over half the country s electricity hit record lows venezuela generates around 65 percent of its electricity from hydropower with a view to leave as much oil available as possible for export but this has made electricity supplies increasingly vulnerable to droughts induced by climate change impacts it is well known that the el nino southern oscillation the biggest fluctuation in the earth s climate system comprising a cycle of warm and cold sea surface temperatures in the tropical pacific ocean is increasing in frequency and intensity due to climate change a new study on the impact of climate change in venezuela finds that between 1950 and 2004 12 out of 15 el nino events coincided with years in which mean annual flow of water in the caroni river basin affecting the guri reservoir and hydroelectric power was smaller than the historical mean from 2013 to 2016 an intensified el nino cycle meant that there was little rain in venezuela culminating in a crippling deficit in 2015 it was the worst drought in almost half a century in the country severely straining the country s aging and poorly managed energy grid resulting in rolling blackouts according to professor juan carlos sanchez a co recipient of the 2007 nobel peace prize for his work with intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc these trends will dramatically deteriorate under a business as usual scenario large areas of venezuelan states which are already water scarce such as falcon sucre lara and zulia including the north of the guajira peninsula will undergo desertification land degradation and decreased rainfall would devastate production of corn black beans and plantains across much of the country sanchez predicts that some regions of the country will receive 25 percent less water than today and that means even less electricity by mid century climate models indicate an overall 18 percent decrease in rainfall in the caroni river basin that leads to the guri dam unfortunately no venezuelan government has ever taken seriously its climate pledges preferring to escalate as much as possible its oil production and even intensifying the co2 intensive practice of gas flaring meanwhile escalating climate change is set to exacerbate venezuela s electricity blackouts infrastructure collapse and agricultural crisis economic war the crisis convergence unfolding in venezuela gives us a window into what can happen when a post oil future is foisted upon you as domestic energy supplies dwindle the state s capacity to function recedes in unprecedented ways opening the way for state failure as the state collapses new smaller centres of power emerge competing for control of diminishing resources in this context reports of food trafficking as a mechanism of economic war are real but they are not exclusive to either political side all sides have become incentivised to horde products and sell them on the black market as a direct result of the collapsing economy retrograde government price controls and wildly speculative prices venezuelan state owned media have pinpointed cases where private companies engaged in hoarding have close ties to the opposition in response the government has appropriated vast assets farmland bakeries other businesses but has failed to lift production on the other hand katiuska rodriguez a journalist investigating shortages at el nacional a pro opposition newspaper said that there is little clear evidence of hoarding being a result of an economic war by capitalist business elites against the government although real she explained hoarding is driven largely by commercial interests in survival and yet there is mounting evidence that the maduro government is complicit in not just hoarding but mass embezzlement of public funds sociologist chris carlson of the city university of new york graduate center points outthat a number of former senior chavista government officials have come on record to confirm how powerful elites within the government have exploited the crisis to extract huge profits for themselves a gang was created that was only interested in getting their hands on the oil revenue said hector navarro former chavista minister and socialist party leader similarly chavez s former finance minister jorge giordani estimated that some 300 billion was embezzled in this way and yet the real economic war is not really going on inside

the inept and corrupt presidency of donald trump has unwittingly triggered the fatal blow to the american empire the abandonment of the dollar as the world s principal reserve currency nations around the globe especially in europe have lost confidence in the united states to act rationally much less lead in issues of international finance trade diplomacy and war these nations are quietly dismantling the seven decade old alliance with the united states and building alternative systems of bilateral trade this reconfiguring of the world s financial system will be fatal to the american empire as the historian alfred mccoy and the economist michael hudson have long pointed out it will trigger an economic death spiral including high inflation which will necessitate a massive military contraction overseas and plunge the united states into a prolonged depression trump rather than make america great again has turned out unwittingly to be the empire s most aggressive gravedigger the trump administration has capriciously sabotaged the global institutions including nato the european union the united nations the world bank and the imf which provide cover and lend legitimacy to american imperialism and global economic hegemony the american empire as mccoy points out was always a hybrid of past empires it developed he writes a distinctive form of global governance that incorporated aspects of antecedent empires ancient and modern this unique u s imperium was athenian in its ability to forge coalitions among allies roman in its reliance on legions that occupied military bases across most of the known world and british in its aspiration to merge culture commerce and alliances into a comprehensive system that covered the globe when george w bush unilaterally invaded iraq defying with his doctrine of preemptive war international law and dismissing protests from traditional allies he began the rupture but trump has deepened the fissures the trump administration s withdrawal from the 2015 iranian nuclear agreement although iran had abided by the agreement and demand that european nations also withdraw or endure u s sanctions saw european nations defect and establish an alternative monetary exchange system that excludes the united states iran no longer accepts the dollar for oil on international markets and has replaced it with the euro not a small factor in washington s deep animus to teheran turkey is also abandoning the dollar the u s demand that germany and other european states halt the importation of russian gas likewise saw the europeans ignore washington china and russia traditionally antagonistic are now working in tandem to free themselves from the dollar moscow has transferred 100 billion of its reserves into chinese yuan japanese yen and euros and as ominously foreign governments since 2014 are no longer storing their gold reserves in the united states or as with germany removing them from the federal reserve germany has repatriated its 300 tons of gold ingots the netherlands repatriated its 100 tons the u s intervention in venezuela the potential trade war with china the withdrawal from international climate accords leaving the intermediate range nuclear forces inf treaty the paralysis in washington and disruptive government shutdown and increased hostilities with iran bode ill for america american foreign and financial policy is hostage to the bizarre whims of stunted ideologues such as mike pompeo john bolton and elliott abrams this ensures more global chaos as well as increased efforts by nations around the globe to free themselves from the economic stranglehold the united states effectively set in place following world war ii it is only a question of when not if the dollar will be sidelined that it was trump along with his fellow ideologues of the extreme right who destroyed the international structures put in place by global capitalists rather than socialists these capitalists invested tremendous resources to crush is grimly ironic the historian ronald robinson argued that british imperial rule died when colonial rulers had run out of indigenous collaborators the result he noted was that the inversion of collaboration into noncooperation largely determined the timing of the decolonization this process of alienating traditional u s allies and collaborators will have the same effect as mccoy points out all modern empires have relied on dependable surrogates to translate their global power into local control and for most of them the moment when those elites began to stir talk back and assert their own agendas was also the moment when you knew that imperial collapse was in the cards the dollar because of astronomical government debt now at 21 trillion a debt that will be augmented by trump s tax cuts costing the u s treasury 1 5 trillion over the next decade is becoming less and less trustworthy the debt to gdp ratio is now more than 100 percent a flashing red light for economists our massive trade deficit depends on selling treasury bonds abroad once those bonds decline in value and are no longer considered a stable investment the dollar will suffer a huge devaluation there are signs this process is underway central bank reserves hold fewer dollars than they did in 2004 there are fewer swift payments the exchange for interbank fund transfers in dollars than in 2015 half of international trade is invoiced in dollars although the u s share of international trade is only 10 percent ultimately we will have reserve currencies other than the u s dollar the bank of england gov mark carney announced last month sixty one percent of foreign currency reserves are in dollars as these dollar currency reserves are replaced by other currencies the retreat from the dollar will accelerate the recklessness of america s financial policies will only exacerbate the crisis if unlimited borrowing financed by printing money were a path to prosperity irwin m stelzer of the hudson institute said recently then venezuela and zimbabwe would be top of the growth tables mccoy explains what a world financial order untethered from the dollar would look like for the majority of americans the 2020s will likely be remembered as a demoralizing decade of rising prices stagnant wages and fading international competitiveness after years of swelling deficits fed by incessant warfare in distant lands in 2030 the u s dollar eventually loses its special status as the world s dominant reserve currency suddenly there are punitive price increases for american imports ranging from clothing to computers and the costs for all overseas activity surges as well making travel for both tourists and troops prohibitive unable to pay for swelling deficits by selling now devalued treasury notes abroad washington is finally forced to slash its bloated military budget under pressure at home and abroad its forces begin to pull back from hundreds of overseas bases to a continental perimeter such a desperate move however comes too late faced with a fading superpower incapable of paying its bills china india iran russia and other powers provocatively challenge u s dominion over the oceans space and cyberspace the collapse of the dollar will mean mccoy writes soaring prices ever rising unemployment and a continuing decline in real wages throughout the 2020s domestic divisions widen into violent clashes and divisive debates often over symbolic insubstantial issues the deep disillusionment and widespread rage will give an opening to trump or a trump like demagogue to lash out perhaps by inciting violence against scapegoats at home and abroad but by then the u s empire will be so diminished its threats will be at least to those outside its borders largely meaningless it is impossible to predict when this flight from the dollar will take place by the second half of the 19th century the u s economy had overtaken britain but it was not until the middle of the 20th century that the dollar replaced the pound sterling to become the dominant currency in international trade the pound

president weah and his apologists have been parroting imaginary achievements on a scandal sheet in the name of first year achievements of the pro poor agenda it is like an emperor who parades the street naked under the guise of being in new suits alan woods 2018 juxtaposing the tempo and mood of the people in the streets communities and villages to that of the list of so called achievements further exposes the political nakedness of president weah and his cabal of looters the people have refused to be placated by such childish propaganda this has sent shockwave through the regime elements and stooges they cannot fathom how the ridiculous illusion the people had in george weah has evaporated like a drop of water on hot stove ibid however we have always told the elements in the cdc that anyone who thinks that the people will place president george weah over their collective destiny needs to see a psychiatrist a resounding message has been sent the illusion of the people who voted this farce cannot be salvaged by the listing of vanity projects that have little or no bearings on their material welfare the country has been falling into grotesque ruins as the people barely find a day s meal to consume due to austerity measures recommended by the bretton woods institutions and the hike in recurrent expenditure the envelope for social services in the budget such as healthcare education water and sanitation electricity etc has experienced brutal leakage the piecemeal development in these sectors have been implemented at the expense of grants and aid from donor partners a development funding strategy which has proven futile for solving structural imbalances and curtailing social inequality in third world countries this is the neo liberal agenda african countries have been subjected to since imperialism through convert and overt maneuvering prohibited the building of a new independent sovereign and self reliant state by progressive african governments after 70years of colonialism and over four centuries of the trans atlantic slave trade while countries like liberia which became an entrenched de facto colony of the united states after the second imperialist war look up to the imf and world bank and recently chinese and middle eastern financial institutions for capital to build roads dams etc the resources and labor of the african people that should be the utilized to develop the continent are exploited by foreign monopoly capital and the surplus expatriated with little benefits for the african people this is the system that has kept the liberian society backward the excesses of this system led to the illusion in a george weah but his coming to power is like the more things change the more they remain the same the continuous development of underdevelopment an indication that change of politicians in the neo colonial state which promotes the ancillaries of capitalism cannot ensure genuine social transformation for the african people so inflation has hit the rooftop spiraling at 23 4percent in 2018 as compared to 12 9percent in 2017 according to a 2018 central bank of liberia report the exchange rate has skyrocketed to l 163 00 us 1 00 despite the questionable infusion of us 25million by the central bank of liberia and ministry of finance to mop up excess liquidity in 2018 the economy did not attract any capital investment due to not only the gloomy outlook of the world s economy but also the lack of key infrastructure for capital investment in liberia and the gross irresponsibility of the weah led government to uphold the rule of law thus the unemployment and underemployment crisis has worsened in the country in 2018 the government announced reductions in the prices of imported 25kg and 50kg bags of rice after president weah held a meeting with the rice cartel unfortunately the price of the country s staple has increased astronomically as the right strategies to make the country food secured and reduce the reliance on imported rice have not been adopted reduction of import tariffs on 2500 commodities did little to reduce prices as such intervention only benefited importers who are predominantly indians and lebanese and further hurt the masses of the poor there is a sharp decline in the collection of tax and non tax revenue as the country recorded the highest budget shortfall of us 225million according to the 2018 central bank report but while the cbl reported that the cause of the decline in government revenue is due to fall in tax revenue from international trade personal income etc the economy recorded us 106million in iron ore export and us 68million in rubber export according to the president s 2nd annual message to the 54th legislature the export value of gold was not provided by the president but in 2017 the cia fact sheet reported that gold recorded the highest foreign currency value in the economy according to a world bank 2018 report a 3 0percent projected growth in the liberian economy would be attributed to an increased in gold production so one can conclude that the 2018 export value of gold is higher than iron ore and rubber according to the cbl 2018 report the liberian economy expanded by an estimated 3 0percent in 2018 to us 932 5million from us 904 3million in 2017 the report also indicates that the projected growth in gdp was mainly on account of developments in the mining and panning sector through industrial gold production and the agriculture and fishery sectors according to the cbl production of iron ore rubber diamond cocoa crude palm oil and cement increased while beverages and sawn timber decreased the irony of the growth in the economy and the fall in government revenue is just an indication of how the neo colonial capitalist system works against the african people the system works in a way that the african working class is subjected to wage slavery and other inhumane exploitations government is given little in taxes and royalties by the foreign multinational corporations that have ownership of the commanding heights of the economy workers wages are unable to meet their demand for goods and services while the paltry sum in taxes and royalties to government are only enough to pay the salary and emoluments of bureaucrats and politicians in the neo colonial state vast portion of these amount accumulated from the exploitation of the labor and resources of the country is expatriated instead of being used to expand the productive forces like history saw capitalism worked for europe and north america this is because due to the unscientific imposition of the capitalist mode of production on the pre capitalists mode of production on the liberian society the country does not have a capital owning class to have ownership and control of the properties of production the owners of the capital accumulated from the production of gold iron ore rubber diamond etc come from the metropoles of capitalism so instead of investing the accumulated surplus to further develop the productive forces and expand the productivity of labor in the liberian economy the surplus profit is exported to asia europe and america thus the manufacturing and agriculture sectors which have the highest prospects for massive job creation in the economy are lagging liberia has remained the supplier of raw materials to first world economies and exporter of finished goods from asia europe and america that has been the position of liberia in the unequal international division of labor especially after the second imperialist war in 1945 from the numbers we can say that in 2019 the people must brace themselves for the worst economic catastrophe during the regime of madame sirleaf the cdc demonstrated the capability of mobilizing popular opinion due to the objective condition in the country a condition caused by the neo liberal capitalist model which was vehemently adhered to by ellen johnson sirleaf for which she not only won many accolades from western backed international organizations but was also on the front pages of western mainstream media as a champion of democracy but after the cdc s first year in power it has been proven that governance is more than just organizing popular anger as the party has proven that it is not a genuine social movement that can break away from the status quo but a personality cult used the celebrity status of president weah to spout populist rhetoric without having the ideas to transform the homeland due to such incompetence the harsh social contradictions keep compounding and speedily putting an end to the people s illusion in the weah regime beside the ruling party being a fanatic of neoliberalism president weah has been on a brutal violation safari bridging provisions in the constitution and other laws at will the president recently nominated and commissioned one of his cronies as liberia s ambassador to the us without being confirmed by the liberian senate a gross violation of article 54 of the 1986 constitution the 2009 act of the liberia extractive industry transparency initiative leiti was victimized when president weah appointed gabriel nyenkan as the head of secretariat although the act calls or the head to be appointed by the multi stakeholders group the president refused to rescind the appointment despite popular outcry from reputable institutions such as global witness as well as sections of the population a bill to strip tenure positions from anti graft institutions was submitted to the 54th legislature by the executive a smart attempt to undermine the independence of integrity institutions and stack these institutions with pliant stooges that will do his bidding apart from these the government is inundated with scandal scandal and scandal if it is not the bogus eton loan scheme it is the 419 ebomaf loan fiasco if it is not the payment of questionable debts by the ministry of finance it is the roofing of 205 zinc sharks in gibraltar at the cost of over us 1million president weah through the ministry of state and presidential affairs rubbished provisions of the public procurement and concession act to award roads and other contracts to his lebanese cronies one of those companies is the sidani group holding the contracts of the community roads being constructed were awarded to these lebanese friends of president weah without national competitive bidding process the president halted the bidding process and awarded the national port authority npa headquarters construction contract to bmc ali a lebanese company the vip longue duty free store and restaurant at the newly constructed terminal of the roberts international airport ria were given out to foreign businesses although qualified liberian businesses bided for the business spaces at the country s major port of entry the awarding of these contracts to foreign businesses that export their profits instead of reinvesting in other productive sectors of the liberian economy is a slap in the face of the rhetoric spewed by the president that liberians will not be spectators in their own economy liberians are not only spectators in their own economy they have drifted to being slaves and serfs in their own country under the weah led government in just one year the president has acquired overnight wealth that he did not have as a private citizen and senator of montserrado county his penchant for luxury runs contrary to the collective aspiration of the people he has turned the public treasury into a safe that funds his desire for opulence this is evidence by president weah using over us 1million on foreign travels in less than a year lavish weekend parties are held at his newly furbished jamaica resort where actresses from ghana and nigeria are habitually seen and it has become a normal routine for president weah and his lackeys while construction works on the military hospital remain stagnant president weah numerous estate investments have been fast tracked in and around monrovia key members of the president s cabinet that could not afford to pay house rents two years ago are now owners of lucrative properties nathaniel mcgill minister of state now owns a house worth us 250 000 00 off the robertsfield highway samuel tweah the lousy minister of finance is building a modern estate in ben s town marshall city margibi county jefferson koijee the college degenerate and mayor of monrovia bought a compound on 19th street sinkor at the cost of us 195 000 00 and is constructing a three story exotic hacienda on the property the public went in frenzy when president weah announced that no senior official of his government would make more than us 7 000 00 as monthly take home pay but before the dust could settle henry costa a popular talk show host and one of the fearless critics of the weah led government in 2018 disclosed a check of us 8 000 00 as saifuah m gray s september allowance it was said by mr henry costa that miss gray who enjoys the privilege of a very special relationship with president weah makes us 12 000 00 in monthly salary and benefit as the president of the national oil company of liberia nocal the regime spews rhetoric right but goes left president weah announced a 25percent reduction of his salary and benefits but the budget of the president s office ballooned from us 15million in the 2017 2018 fiscal year to us 21million in the 2018 2019 fiscal budget the government announced cuts in the salary of top officials of government under the veil of mobilizing resources to fund social programs but the wage bill which was us 297million in the 2017 2018 fiscal year soured to us 317million in 2018 2019 although there was no increment in the wages of civil servants teachers doctors nurses etc critical members of the opposition civil society and media have been bullied by the cdc led government this shows the intolerance of the national and international scandal calling itself a government journalists jonathan pay lay lay rodney sieh patrick honnah henry costa t max jlateh alfred sirleaf daily talk etc are all victims of the incompetent regime also the cdc led government has refused to review and renegotiate all bogus concession agreements and contracts signed into law by the ellen led government although the ruling party was one of the strongest critics of these agreements during its days in opposition firestone arcelor mittal mng gold mine sime darby gvl liberty gold china union etc are not only still exploiting the labor and resources of our people and country they are expatriating the surplus profits instead of reinvesting in other sectors of the economy the multinationals expatriate millions of dollars from our country and not only pay paltry sum to government s revenue but also subject liberian workers to wage slavery and other appalling exploitations the little in taxes and rent given to national government is only sufficient to run and maintain the corrupt bureaucracy of the state which keeps such a system in place the government has turned a deaf ear to calls from many liberians to investigate and prosecute robert sirleaf for leading the caravan that bankrupted the national oil company of liberia nocal probably robert sirleaf the son of former president sirleaf is being rewarded for allegedly helping to bankroll the election campaign of the ruling coalition for democratic change cdc in 2017 under the watch of ellen johnson sirleaf there was massive looting of state resources for personal benefits but the cdc led government has refused to set up a commission of inquiry to investigate cases of corruption during ellen s 12 year rule this is a proof that george weah s priority is to ensure the protection ellen sirleaf her family and cronies at the expense of the people no wonder there is growing discontent anger fury and hatred among the people for george weah and his clique of bureaucratic parasites the people s anger was expressed when hundreds of market women students workers and youth took to the streets on september 24 2018 to protest against the looting of billions of liberian dollars intended to replace mutilated bank notes and the people are being mobilized once again to march against the weah tyranny on social media the people are expressing their indignation especially at the construction of luxurious private estates by president weah and the lack of accountability for the us 25million taken from the country s foreign reserves to mop up the excess liquidity of liberian dollars on the radio the people are chanting cries of disappointment in the country giant turned country devil in the district 13 montserrado county s by election the people rejected the candidate whose hands were lifted by president weah in a major campaign rally a strange phenomenon to those with a scanty understanding of the general laws of change in nature society and human thought the result of the by election in sinoe county had to be fingered to favor the cdc s candidate a hint of what is to come in the 2023 presidential election this massive shift in the consciousness of the people is just a proof that a government that refuses to resolve the social contradictions that brought it to the helm of power must not expect the continuous support and commitment of the people but it seems george weah is a political falcao who has refused to listen to the masses and has reneged on devoting the government to promoting the transformation of the nation and people as the people rapidly lose faith in the farce it would resort to black fascism wherein alternative voices will be mysteriously purged this has already started to show its ugly face with threats being thrown at critics of the government with a people caged in squalor and poverty their patience is fast reaching its limitation this farcical order is dying sooner than we expected the cynics who scorned predictions of the farce not lasting longer than six years are silently eating their words our responsibility is to ensure that the inevitable break in the point of stasis by the people produces a social revolution that commits itself to the qualitative transformation of society moses uneh yahmia is a youth and students activist he is a staunch member of the movement for

well what do you know it turns out that amateur economist donald j trump knows more about sound monetary policy than federal reserve chairman jerome powell and his team of hundreds of phd economists call it street smarts or call it business moxie but president trump was dead right when he attacked the fed first in september and then even more savagely after the fed s christmas eve rate hike massacre which led to a 2 000 point crash in the dow jones industrial average with more than 500 points of that blood spillage occurring while chairman powell was making his economically hapless rate hike announcement the political left and the media rallied around the fed s actions and could hardly have been more disdainful of the president on this issue they seemed to want the economy to falter so as to discredit mr trump s policies the new york times and others scolded how dare trump attack the economic oracles at the temple the left has acted as if fed chairman powell has some kind of divine infallibility as if he were the pope but of course we learned with the 4 trillion meltdown in the stock market that the fed is not just fallible but has lost its grip on the steering wheel fortunately last week the fed put its tail between its legs and as the wall street journal put it issued its apology by signaling to financial markets that no more rate hikes are likely this year the retreat by the fed began shortly after christmas and eureka markets are healthy again though still rightly skittish about the china trade war after the fed started backing off the threat of even tighter money in 2019 commodity prices pulled out of their dangerous deflationary spiral from the time of the fed s september rate hike through the end of december general commodity prices lead copper silver soybeans wheat etc collapsed by nearly 13 percent then in december consumer prices fell by 0 1 percent the only logical reason for the fed to raise interest rates and or sell off the assets on its balance sheet would be to fight inflation but there was no inflation at the time of their last two rate hike decisions the fed should have been cutting rates not raising them but at least by calling off the dogs with their turnabout on future rate hikes the fed enabled commodity prices to rally although they are still too low unfortunately the fed severely damaged its credibility with the financial markets and the voters via its acts of economic malpractice late last year the wild swings in the markets caused by the fed are destabilizing and add risk and uncertainty jerome powell s job is to dampen market volatility not to stimulate it mr trump saw the perils of excessively tight money before nearly anyone else he said that the rate hikes were colliding with his pro growth tax cut and deregulatory policies and thus preventing the 3 percent to 4 percent growth that america wants and deserves the trump growth agenda increased global demand for dollars at the very time the fed started pulling back on dollar supply this set in motion the destructive deflation of the last quarter of 2018 that left so many investors standing on the ledge the fed was responsible for the worst december for the stock market in 60 years what is doubly confounding about the fed inspired financial collapse is that mistakes like this are so easily avoided the fed could have simply adopted the rule that the two of us have been pushing and targeted for stable commodity prices this is the strategy that paul volcker employed in the early 1980s to break the back of hyperinflation had the fed done this the stock market collapse would have been avoided and the real economy wouldn t have been jolted stock prices and the crb index have been highly correlated stock values fell and then rose primarily in nominal terms not in real terms as gauged by the crb index see chart the fed can keep commodity prices stable by selling bonds when prices are rising and buying them when prices are falling investors were pleased when the fed also pulled back on its unwinding of the balance sheet as this also stops the unwise yanking of dollar liquidity out of the market in a deflationary environment many investors are looking at the fed s recent policy switch toward stable money with an attitude of better late than never however that isn t good enough the fed should hardly be congratulated for cleaning up its own mess that s why we want a permanent change in fed monetary policy that will ensure stable money if the fed does this mr trump s other economic policies will continue to produce rapid growth stephen moore a columnist for the washington times is a senior fellow at the heritage foundation louis woodhill is a texas based investor who finances small business start ups copyright c 2019 news world communications inc this content is published through a licensing agreement with acquire media using its newsedge technology

war drove the united states off gold by 1971 its sponsorship and funding of violent regime change wars against venezuela and syria and threatening other countries with sanctions if they do not join this crusade is driving european and other nations to create their alternative financial institutions this break has been building for quite some time and was bound to occur no left wing party no socialist anarchist or foreign nationalist leader anywhere in the world could have achieved what he is doing to break up the american empire the deep state is reacting with shock at how this right wing real estate grifter has been able toit is almost like a black political comedy the world of international diplomacy is being turned inside out a world where there is no longer even a pretense that we might adhere to international norms let alone laws or treaties the neocons who trump has appointed are accomplishing what seemed unthinkable not long ago driving china and russia together the great nightmare of henry kissinger and zbigniew brzezinski they also are driving germany and other european countries into the eurasian orbit the heartland nightmare of halford mackinder a century ago the root cause is clear after the crescendo of pretenses and deceptions over iraq libya and syria along with our absolution of the lawless regime of saudi arabia foreign political leaders are coming to recognize what world wide public opinion polls reported even before the iraq iran contra boys turned their attention to the world s largest oil reserves in venezuela it defines democracy to mean supporting u s foreign policy pursuing neoliberal privatization of public infrastructure dismantling government regulation and following the direction of u s dominated global institutions from the imf and world bank to nato for decades the resulting foreign wars domestic austerity programs and military interventions have brought more violence not democracy in the devil s dictionary that u s diplomats are taught to use as their elements of style guidelines for doublethink the ukraine is deemed democratic along with saudi arabia israel and other countries that act as u s financial and military protectorates and are willing to treat america s enemies are theirs too a point had to come where this policy collided with the self interest of other nations finally breaking through the public relations rhetoric of empire other countries are proceeding to de dollarize and replace what u s diplomacy calls internationalism meaning u s nationalism imposed on the rest of the world with their own national self interest this trajectory could be seen 50 years ago i described it in super imperialism and global fracture it had to happen but nobody thought that the end would come in quite the way that is happening history has turned into comedy or at least irony as its dialectical path unfolds for the past half century u s strategists the state department and national endowment for democracy ned worried thatit therefore spent enormous resources manipulating parties that called themselves socialist tony blair s british labour party france s socialist party germany s social democrats etc but u s political planners and great wurlitzer organistsimagining that it would instinctively support u s thuggishness trump s agenda may really be to break up the american empire using the old uncle sucker isolationist rhetoric of half a century ago he certainly is going for the empire s most vital organs he might as well be but it would be a false mental leap to use cui bono to assume that he is a witting agent after all if no u s contractor supplier labor union or bank will deal with him would vladimir putin china or iran be any more naïve perhapsany international system of control requires the rule of law it may be a morally lawless exercise of ruthless power imposing predatory exploitation but it is still the law and it needs courts to apply it backed by police power to enforce it and punish violators the united states always has resisted letting any other country have any voice in u s domestic policies law making or diplomacy that is what makes america the exceptional nation but for seventy years its diplomats have pretended that its superior judgment promoted a peaceful world as the roman empire claimed to be which let other countries share in prosperity and rising living standards at the united nationsat the world bank and imf they also made sure that their equity share was large enough to give them veto power over any loan or other policy without such power the united states would not join any international organization yet at the same time it depicted its nationalism as protecting globalization and internationalism inevitably u s nationalism had to break up the mirage of one world internationalism and with it any thought of an international court without veto power over the judges therecently that court undertook an investigation into u s war crimes in afghanistan from its torture policies to bombing of civilian targets such as hospitals weddings and infrastructure that investigation ultimately found a reasonable basis to believe that war crimes and crimes against humanity donald trump s national security adviser john bolton erupted in fury warning in september that that prompted a senior judge christoph flügge from germany to resign in protest indeed bolton told the court to keep out of any affairs involving the united states promising to ban the court s judges and prosecutors from entering the united states what this meant the german judge spelled out was that the original inspiration of the court to use the nuremburg laws that were applied against german nazis to bring similar prosecution against any country or officials found guilty of committing war crimes had already fallen into disuse with the failure to indict the authors of the chilean coup iran contra or the u s invasion of iraq for war crimes of all areas of global power politics today international finance and foreign investment have become the key flashpoint central banks have long held their gold and other monetary reserves in the united states and london back in 1945 this seemed reasonable because the new york federal reserve bank in whose basement foreign central bank gold was kept was militarily safe and because the london gold pool was the vehicle by which the u s treasury kept the dollar as good as gold at 35 an ounce foreign reserves over and above gold were kept in the form of u s treasury securities to be bought and sold on the new york and london foreign exchange markets to stabilize exchange rates most foreign loans to governments were denominated in u s dollars so wall street banks were normally named as paying agents that was the case with iran under the shah whom the united states had installed after sponsoring the 1953 coup against mohammed mosaddegh when he sought to nationalize anglo iranian oil now british petroleum or at least tax it after the shah was overthrown theat the direction of the u s government chase refused to do so but that was a generation ago and only recently did foreign countries begin to feel queasy about leaving their gold holdings in the united states where they might be grabbed at will to punish any country that might act in ways that u s diplomacy found offensive so last year u s officials pretended to feel shocked at the insult that it might do to a civilized christian country what it had done to iran and germany agreed to slow down the transfer but then came venezuela desperate to spend its gold reserves to provide imports for its economy devastated by u s sanctions a crisis that u s diplomats blame on socialism not on u s political attempts to make the economy scream as nixon officials said of chile under salvador allende held in its vaults and those of other central banks in december 2018 this was just like a bank depositor would expect a bank to pay a check that the depositor had written as bloomberg reported turkey seemed to be a likely destination prompting bolton and pompeo to warn it to desist from helping venezuela threatening sanctions against it or any other country helping venezuela cope with its economic crisis as for the bank of england and other european countries the bloomberg report concluded this led to rumors that venezuela was selling 20 tons of gold via a russian boeing 777 some 840 million the money probably would have ended up paying russian and chinese bondholders as well as buying food to relieve the local famine russia denied this report but reuters has confirmed is thatwith another 15 tones are to be shipped on friday february 1 the u s senate s batista cuban hardlinerif there is any country that u s diplomats hate more than a recalcitrant latin american country it is iran president trump s breaking of the 2015 nuclear agreements negotiated by european and obama administration diplomats has escalated to the point of threatening germany and other european countries with punitive sanctions if they do not also break the agreements they have signed coming on top of u s opposition to german and other european importing of russian gas theno country including russia or china can mount a military invasion of another major country since the vietnam era uch as the united states has inflicted on iraq libya and syria and the major cyber connections are financial money transfer ones headed bythe acronym for the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication which is centered in belgium russia and china have already moved to create a shadow bank transfer system in case the united states unplugs them from swift but now european countries have come to realize thaton january 31 the dam broke with the announcement thatgermany france and even the u s poodle britain joined to createthe promise is that this will be used only for humanitarian aid to save iran from a u s sponsored venezuela type devastation but in view of increasingly passionate u s opposition to the nord stream pipeline to carry russian gas this alternative bank clearing system will be ready and able to become operative if the united states tries to direct a sanctions attack on europe i have just returned from germany and seen a remarkable split between that nation s industrialists and their political leadership for years major companies have seena complementary economy needing to modernize its manufacturing and able to supply europe with natural gas and other raw materials warning europe against dependence on low price russian gas it has offered to sell high priced lng from the united states via port facilities that do not yet exist in anywhere near the volume required not from german or french merchants of death in addition to driving russia and china together u s diplomacy is adding europe to the heartland independent of u s ability to bully into the state of dependency toward which american diplomacy has aimed to achieve since 1945 its steady policy since its inception is to provide loans for countries to devote their land to export crops instead of giving priority to feeding themselves that is why its loans are only in foreign currency not in the domestic currency needed to provide price supports and agricultural extension services such as have made u s agriculture so productive sanctions against providing them with grain and other food in case they step out of line with u s diplomatic demands it is worthwhile to note that our global imposition of the mythical efficiencies of forcing latin american countries to become plantations for export crops like coffee and bananas rather than growing their own wheat and corn has failed catastrophically to deliver better lives especially for those living in central america the spread between the export crops and cheaper food imports from the u s that was supposed to materialize for countries following our playbook failed miserably witness the caravans and refugees across mexico of course our backing of the most brutal military dictators and crime lords has not helped either likewise thea central core has been to enforce payment of official inter government debt by withholding imf credit from countries under default this rule was instituted at a time when most official inter government debt was owed to the united states but a few years ago ukraine defaulted on 3 billion owed to russia the imf has been extending credit to the bottomless pit of ukrainian corruption to encourage its anti russian policy rather than standing up for the principle that inter government debts must be paid it is as if the imf now operates out of a small room in the basement of the pentagon in washington this became clear last autumn at the funeral for george h w bush when the eu s diplomat found himself downgraded to the end of the list to be called to his seat he was told that the u s no longer considers the eu an entity in good standing in december it is not all president trump s doing of course instead of applauding democracy when foreign countries do not elect a leader approved by u s diplomats whether it is allende or maduro it s now out in the open trump is not alone in supporting saudi arabia and its wahabi terrorists acting as lyndon johnson put it

it s been two months of intense stress for the financial markets we assisted at one of the worst december performance in recent history driven by uncertainty around china and usa trade deals and some question marks on the brexit deal during the same timeframe gold spiked from 1200 oz level on november 13th to 1320 oz on january 31st history teaches us that investors tend to buy and hold on gold during time of financial turmoil and uncertainty certainly 2018 was a stressful year for the financial markets which caused a spike in volatility and an appreciation in the gold price in this article i will review what drives the price change in gold and will make my claim why gold is still bullish for us in 2019 data by ycharts gold interest rates and usd correlation before diving into possibile scenario for this commodity in the near future it is important to understand what causes the move in gold gold is inversely correlated with the us dollar when the us dollar gets stronger gold usually declines and when the us dollar gets weaker gold usually raises below a picture of the dollar index dxy which will compare to the above picture of gold barchart as we can see from the two charts dxy and gold tend to move in an opposite way analyzing the timeframe that goes from 2006 to 2012 we can see that the usd started to decline because the economy entered a recession phase where the federal reserve started to lower interest rates it is important to notice that interest rates and the us dollar are directly correlated when the fed decides to lower interest rates the uds depreciates there reason for this is that lower interest rates is a sign of a weak economy the central bank is trying to stimulate the economy which leads foreign investor to diverge their investments to other opportunities leading to a weak currency on the other hand in a period of economic boom the us dollar appreciates and attracts investors because there is a strong economy and a stronger demand for us products which indeed leads the currency to appreciate at this point we can also argue that gold and interest rates are also inversely correlated as previously shown going back to the main argument of comparison during the recovery phase gold continued to increase because the united states kept interest rates at close to zero in order to fully recover from the financial crisis once the economy finally stabilized interest rates started to increase and this attracted foreign investors which led to an appreciation of the usd during the same time gold started to depreciate because investors believed that the us fully recovered from the recession and a new expansion phase started after this explanation one can deduct two things from this correlation the first is the gold price is driven by economic factors such as demand and supply and financial turmoil the second one is that gold price is also determined by psychology for psychology i intend human reaction to events or circumstances that have not happened yet but that may happen in the near future an example of this is the november to january s rally that we have just assisted gold started to appreciate quickly in this last two months because tensions between china and usa and a possible trade war started to raise and uncertainty in the global economy posed some question marks to the investors who diverged to gold lastly the federal reserved announced in their december meeting and also in their january meeting that there is a possibility to stabilize interest rates or to actually lower interest rates in the near future this shows that they believe the economy is ready for another expansion phase after retracting during the last quarter of 2018 this news led to gold to spike and it was a major catalyst of the last raise in gold price news events future outlook on wednesday the fed left the rate unchanged between 2 25 percent and 2 50 percent yields were pressured after fed policymakers said the central bank would be patient when making decisions about future monetary policy the fed also removed references to â further gradual increasesâ to the federal funds rate in its monetary policy the drop in u s treasury yields helped make the u s dollar a less attractive investment sending gold prices sharply higher as of a result gold spiked and gained 1 on thursday currently the fed chairman jerome powell is paying lots of attention at the financial markets in an interview on cnbc doubleline capital chief executive jeffrey gundlach stated powell is basically saying i am going back into a foxhole and then decide what the next move is powell said i dont want to say anything and i dont want to get pinned down as i did before because it got embarrassing he also asserted that one major indicator is currently signaling a possible turmoil in the next year future the most recessionary signal at present is consumer future expectations relative to current conditions its one of the worst readings ever gundlach tweeted on tuesday cnbc consumer confidence fell sharply more than expected for the second straight month while consumers assessment of the current situation were nearly unchanged and historically strong levels their expectations for the future fell sharply hitting the lowest level since october 16 prior to the presidential election historically this index has been really useful in determining the current status of the economy for example on october 08 consumer confidence index plummeted to 38 the lowest since its inception in 1967 also the research reported that the consumersâ optimism about the short term future was more pessimistic in january the percentage of consumers expecting business conditions will improve over the next six months decreased from 18 1 percent to 16 0 percent while those expecting business conditions will worsen increased from 10 6 percent to 14 8 percent conference board the risk of a recession in the near future has not vanished yet even after an amazing month of january there are still too many factors that can impact the stock market in 2019 like trade war brexit china and usa are set to meet again in february talks still continue but the march 1st deadline is approaching and even tough the two parts seem to be closer there still question marks on the actual result myron brilliant the head of international affairs at the u s chamber of commerce who has been briefed on the talks said china had shown some willingness to make reforms on market access and intellectual property however china has been highly reluctant to budge on sensitive subjects such as technology transfer and subsidies of state owned enterprises for that reason there are significant gaps between the two sides as a result of this continue uncertainty in the deal we should be cautious in analyzing this january rally it certainly looks like the fed wanted to calm down the financial markets and reassure in investors in response of uncertainty in the near future our economy is still strong companies like amzn otc appl fb reported outstanding earnings and the latest nonfarm payrolls reported better than expected data registering an increase in 304k more jobs in this last month compared to the expected consensus of 165k at the moment it looks like the stock market is impacted more on outside events than actually fundamentals this is what fed chairman hinted in the last meeting investors need to pay attention to what is going on overseas especially in europe brexit deal was rejected by the british parliament theresa may was able tough to win the fiduciary vote currently there is lots of uncertainty in the final result of brexit theresa may is set to propose a new brexit deal to the parliament on february 13th the european commission has warned has warned britain must pay the â 39 billion brexit bill even if it leaves the eu without a deal currently there is really no clue on what the result of this event will implicate to the financial markets it will heavily depend on what terms the european union and britain will agree on gold will play a major role once everything is settled as previously showed investors tend to refuge on gold when the market is hit by unexpected outcome or wild outcome the only example we have on brexit is when it was voted on june 24th 2016 as of a result of the unexpected vote on the referendum gold soared as much as 8 percent the day after the shocking vote result currently nothing has changed the two parts are still looking for a deal by march 29th if nothing changes eu laws will not apply to the uk and millions of european workers in the great britain will need a permit to work there we should see a drastic swing in gold price as a result in this hypothetical scenario if nothing changes brexit is not the only event that european are worried about european banks reported unsatisfactory results on february first deutsche bank major german lender disappointed investors with an eighth consecutive decline in quarterly revenues in addition italy registered two consecutive quarters of negative gdp which technically put the country in recession italy was also a major concern in 2018 italian politics has registered a serious of brief governments which didn t bring serenity to italian economics last turmoil was created by a coalition of two extremist parties five stars movement and league party who heavily insisted on new immigration regulations and a possible scenario where the country could also leave europe tensions between those this populist government and the european commission have escalated quickly to the point the eu declared that many intervention by the new italian government were irresponsible in italy the governmentâ s debt load is one of the highest in the world a prolonged economic slump would significantly add to the risk of default with global repercussions in the past the ecb initiated purchases of governments bonds to attract foreign investors a procedure that helped to assure buyers for also the italian government debt at the moment it looks like the ecb is trying to get out of the market as there is a weaker economy momentum hinting for less room of mistake for new policies the populist government has been heavily criticized by other european governments especially for the foolish new proposals that are directing italian people in spending less the italian government led by prime minister giuseppe conte reacted to the result by saying that the numbers were the results of the previous government actions stating that policy like the unemployment program still need to become effective in the meantime the italian spread btp bud a benchmark that compares italian bonds with germany s bond spiked to 260 from 248 after the news europe has showed some sign of slowing economic growth led by china and usa trade war brexit disappoint 2018 for the european banks and now italy s economy continues to aggrevate the current situation european situation will be key to watch in 2019 there will be an handful of major scenarios to pay attention to which can lead investors to move on from the stock market and invest in bonds investors piled into bonds in the past week and pulled billions of dollars from u s and european stocks as they sought safety in assets seen as less risky in times of economic uncertainty bank of america merrill lynch baml said on friday reuters as investors are moving away from european stocks they are also betting on gold a large number of european investors have cited gold as the best investment opportunity over the next 12 months according to a legg mason survey europe funds the survey which polled the views of over 16 000 investors globally found that about a quarter of those polled in germany italy switzerland and the uk identified gold as an investment opportunity in the uk gold was seen as better than equities bonds cash and alternatives over the next year gold has become more popular than last year among uk investors with the total number favoring it up from 22 the firm said funds europe final notes in this article i proposed my case for gold to keep its bullish trend even in 2019 i heavily focused on the major factors that can impact the price for this commodity major economic indicators are showing signs of uncertainty in the market the latest statement by the fed on wednesday confirmed that the future direction of the economy is unclear stating that events such as brexit and the resolution of the trade war with china are still unclear i also underlined how important is to pay attention to other countries especially the european situation where banks are reporting negative results and how it can lead investors to diverge their investment to other sources such as gold lastly i wanted to recommend two etts nysearca jnug and nysearca nugt both are 3x etf mostly recommended for short term investing who have recently surpassed

president weah and his apologists have been parroting imaginary achievements on a scandal sheet in the name of first year achievements of the pro poor agenda it is like an emperor who parades the street naked under the guise of being in new suits alan woods 2018 juxtaposing the tempo and mood of the people in the streets communities and villages to that of the list of so called achievements further exposes the political nakedness of president weah and his cabal of looters the people have refused to be placated by such childish propaganda this has sent shockwave through the regime elements and stooges they cannot fathom how the ridiculous illusion the people had in george weah has evaporated like a drop of water on hot stove ibid however we have always told the elements in the cdc that anyone who thinks that the people will place president george weah over their collective destiny needs to see a psychiatrist a resounding message has been sent the illusion of the people who voted this farce cannot be salvaged by the listing of vanity projects that have little or no bearings on their material welfare the country has been falling into grotesque ruins as the people barely find a day s meal to consume due to austerity measures recommended by the bretton woods institutions and the hike in recurrent expenditure the envelope for social services in the budget such as healthcare education water and sanitation electricity etc has experienced brutal leakage the piecemeal development in these sectors have been implemented at the expense of grants and aid from donor partners a development funding strategy which has proven futile for solving structural imbalances and curtailing social inequality in third world countries this is the neo liberal agenda african countries have been subjected to since imperialism through convert and overt maneuvering prohibited the building of a new independent sovereign and self reliant state by progressive african governments after 70years of colonialism and over four centuries of the trans atlantic slave trade while countries like liberia which became an entrenched de facto colony of the united states after the second imperialist war look up to the imf and world bank and recently chinese and middle eastern financial institutions for capital to build roads dams etc the resources and labor of the african people that should be the utilized to develop the continent are exploited by foreign monopoly capital and the surplus expatriated with little benefits for the african people this is the system that has kept the liberian society backward the excesses of this system led to the illusion in a george weah but his coming to power is like the more things change the more they remain the same the continuous development of underdevelopment an indication that change of politicians in the neo colonial state which promotes the ancillaries of capitalism cannot ensure genuine social transformation for the african people so inflation has hit the rooftop spiraling at 23 4percent in 2018 as compared to 12 9percent in 2017 according to a 2018 central bank of liberia report the exchange rate has skyrocketed to l 163 00 us 1 00 despite the questionable infusion of us 25million by the central bank of liberia and ministry of finance to mop up excess liquidity in 2018 the economy did not attract any capital investment due to not only the gloomy outlook of the world s economy but also the lack of key infrastructure for capital investment in liberia and the gross irresponsibility of the weah led government to uphold the rule of law thus the unemployment and underemployment crisis has worsened in the country in 2018 the government announced reductions in the prices of imported 25kg and 50kg bags of rice after president weah held a meeting with the rice cartel unfortunately the price of the country s staple has increased astronomically as the right strategies to make the country food secured and reduce the reliance on imported rice have not been adopted reduction of import tariffs on 2500 commodities did little to reduce prices as such intervention only benefited importers who are predominantly indians and lebanese and further hurt the masses of the poor there is a sharp decline in the collection of tax and non tax revenue as the country recorded the highest budget shortfall of us 225million according to the 2018 central bank report but while the cbl reported that the cause of the decline in government revenue is due to fall in tax revenue from international trade personal income etc the economy recorded us 106million in iron ore export and us 68million in rubber export according to the president s 2nd annual message to the 54th legislature the export value of gold was not provided by the president but in 2017 the cia fact sheet reported that gold recorded the highest foreign currency value in the economy according to a world bank 2018 report a 3 0percent projected growth in the liberian economy would be attributed to an increased in gold production so one can conclude that the 2018 export value of gold is higher than iron ore and rubber according to the cbl 2018 report the liberian economy expanded by an estimated 3 0percent in 2018 to us 932 5million from us 904 3million in 2017 the report also indicates that the projected growth in gdp was mainly on account of developments in the mining and panning sector through industrial gold production and the agriculture and fishery sectors according to the cbl production of iron ore rubber diamond cocoa crude palm oil and cement increased while beverages and sawn timber decreased the irony of the growth in the economy and the fall in government revenue is just an indication of how the neo colonial capitalist system works against the african people the system works in a way that the african working class is subjected to wage slavery and other inhumane exploitations government is given little in taxes and royalties by the foreign multinational corporations that have ownership of the commanding heights of the economy workers wages are unable to meet their demand for goods and services while the paltry sum in taxes and royalties to government are only enough to pay the salary and emoluments of bureaucrats and politicians in the neo colonial state vast portion of these amount accumulated from the exploitation of the labor and resources of the country is expatriated instead of being used to expand the productive forces like history saw capitalism worked for europe and north america this is because due to the unscientific imposition of the capitalist mode of production on the pre capitalists mode of production on the liberian society the country does not have a capital owning class to have ownership and control of the properties of production the owners of the capital accumulated from the production of gold iron ore rubber diamond etc come from the metropoles of capitalism so instead of investing the accumulated surplus to further develop the productive forces and expand the productivity of labor in the liberian economy the surplus profit is exported to asia europe and america thus the manufacturing and agriculture sectors which have the highest prospects for massive job creation in the economy are lagging liberia has remained the supplier of raw materials to first world economies and exporter of finished goods from asia europe and america that has been the position of liberia in the unequal international division of labor especially after the second imperialist war in 1945 from the numbers we can say that in 2019 the people must brace themselves for the worst economic catastrophe during the regime of madame sirleaf the cdc demonstrated the capability of mobilizing popular opinion due to the objective condition in the country a condition caused by the neo liberal capitalist model which was vehemently adhered to by ellen johnson sirleaf for which she not only won many accolades from western backed international organizations but was also on the front pages of western mainstream media as a champion of democracy but after the cdc s first year in power it has been proven that governance is more than just organizing popular anger as the party has proven that it is not a genuine social movement that can break away from the status quo but a personality cult used the celebrity status of president weah to spout populist rhetoric without having the ideas to transform the homeland due to such incompetence the harsh social contradictions keep compounding and speedily putting an end to the people s illusion in the weah regime beside the ruling party being a fanatic of neoliberalism president weah has been on a brutal violation safari bridging provisions in the constitution and other laws at will the president recently nominated and commissioned one of his cronies as liberia s ambassador to the us without being confirmed by the liberian senate a gross violation of article 54 of the 1986 constitution the 2009 act of the liberia extractive industry transparency initiative leiti was victimized when president weah appointed gabriel nyenkan as the head of secretariat although the act calls or the head to be appointed by the multi stakeholders group the president refused to rescind the appointment despite popular outcry from reputable institutions such as global witness as well as sections of the population a bill to strip tenure positions from anti graft institutions was submitted to the 54th legislature by the executive a smart attempt to undermine the independence of integrity institutions and stack these institutions with pliant stooges that will do his bidding apart from these the government is inundated with scandal scandal and scandal if it is not the bogus eton loan scheme it is the 419 ebomaf loan fiasco if it is not the payment of questionable debts by the ministry of finance it is the roofing of 205 zinc sharks in gibraltar at the cost of over us 1million president weah through the ministry of state and presidential affairs rubbished provisions of the public procurement and concession act to award roads and other contracts to his lebanese cronies one of those companies is the sidani group holding the contracts of the community roads being constructed were awarded to these lebanese friends of president weah without national competitive bidding process the president halted the bidding process and awarded the national port authority npa headquarters construction contract to bmc ali a lebanese company the vip longue duty free store and restaurant at the newly constructed terminal of the roberts international airport ria were given out to foreign businesses although qualified liberian businesses bided for the business spaces at the country s major port of entry the awarding of these contracts to foreign businesses that export their profits instead of reinvesting in other productive sectors of the liberian economy is a slap in the face of the rhetoric spewed by the president that liberians will not be spectators in their own economy liberians are not only spectators in their own economy they have drifted to being slaves and serfs in their own country under the weah led government in just one year the president has acquired overnight wealth that he did not have as a private citizen and senator of montserrado county his penchant for luxury runs contrary to the collective aspiration of the people he has turned the public treasury into a safe that funds his desire for opulence this is evidence by president weah using over us 1million on foreign travels in less than a year lavish weekend parties are held at his newly furbished jamaica resort where actresses from ghana and nigeria are habitually seen and it has become a normal routine for president weah and his lackeys while construction works on the military hospital remain stagnant president weah numerous estate investments have been fast tracked in and around monrovia key members of the president s cabinet that could not afford to pay house rents two years ago are now owners of lucrative properties nathaniel mcgill minister of state now owns a house worth us 250 000 00 off the robertsfield highway samuel tweah the lousy minister of finance is building a modern estate in ben s town marshall city margibi county jefferson koijee the college degenerate and mayor of monrovia bought a compound on 19th street sinkor at the cost of us 195 000 00 and is constructing a three storey exotic hacienda on the property the public went in frenzy when president weah announced that no senior official of his government would make more than us 7 000 00 as monthly take home pay but before the dust could settle henry costa a popular talk show host and one of the fearless critics of the weah led government in 2018 disclosed a check of us 8 000 00 as saifuah m gray s september allowance it was said by mr henry costa that miss gray who enjoys the privilege of a very special relationship with president weah makes us 12 000 00 in monthly salary and benefit as the president of the national oil company of liberia nocal the regime spews rhetoric right but goes left president weah announced a 25percent reduction of his salary and benefits but the budget of the president s office ballooned from us 15million in the 2017 2018 fiscal year to us 21million in the 2018 2019 fiscal budget the government announced cuts in the salary of top officials of government under the veil of mobilizing resources to fund social programs but the wage bill which was us 297million in the 2017 2018 fiscal year soured to us 317million in 2018 2019 although there was no increment in the wages of civil servants teachers doctors nurses etc critical members of the opposition civil society and media have been bullied by the cdc led government this shows the intolerance of the national and international scandal calling itself a government journalists jonathan pay lay lay rodney sieh patrick honnah henry costa t max jlateh alfred sirleaf daily talk etc are all victims of the incompetent regime also the cdc led government has refused to review and renegotiate all bogus concession agreements and contracts signed into law by the ellen led government although the ruling party was one of the strongest critics of these agreements during its days in opposition firestone arcelor mittal mng gold mine sime darby gvl liberty gold china union etc are not only still exploiting the labor and resources of our people and country they are expatriating the surplus profits instead of reinvesting in other sectors of the economy the multinationals expatriate millions of dollars from our country and not only pay paltry sum to government s revenue but also subject liberian workers to wage slavery and other appalling exploitations the little in taxes and rent given to national government is only sufficient to run and maintain the corrupt bureaucracy of the state which keeps such a system in place the government has turned a deaf ear to calls from many liberians to investigate and prosecute robert sirleaf for leading the caravan that bankrupted the national oil company of liberia nocal probably robert sirleaf the son of former president sirleaf is being rewarded for allegedly helping to bankroll the election campaign of the ruling coalition for democratic change cdc in 2017 under the watch of ellen johnson sirleaf there was massive looting of state resources for personal benefits but the cdc led government has refused to set up a commission of inquiry to investigate cases of corruption during ellen s 12 year rule this is a proof that george weah s priority is to ensure the protection ellen sirleaf her family and cronies at the expense of the people no wonder there is growing discontent anger fury and hatred among the people for george weah and his clique of bureaucratic parasites the people s anger was expressed when hundreds of market women students workers and youth took to the streets on september 24 2018 to protest against the looting of billions of liberian dollars intended to replace mutilated bank notes and the people are being mobilized once again to march against the weah tyranny on social media the people are expressing their indignation especially at the construction of luxurious private estates by president weah and the lack of accountability for the us 25million taken from the country s foreign reserves to mop up the excess liquidity of liberian dollars on the radio the people are chanting cries of disappointment in the country giant turned country devil in the district 13 montserrado county s by election the people rejected the candidate whose hands were lifted by president weah in a major campaign rally a strange phenomenon to those with a scanty understanding of the general laws of change in nature society and human thought the result of the by election in sinoe county had to be fingered to favor the cdc s candidate a hint of what is to come in the 2023 presidential election this massive shift in the consciousness of the people is just a proof that a government that refuses to resolve the social contradictions that brought it to the helm of power must not expect the continuous support and commitment of the people but it seems george weah is a political falcao who has refused to listen to the masses and has reneged on devoting the government to promoting the transformation of the nation and people as the people rapidly lose faith in the farce it would resort to black fascism wherein alternative voices will be mysteriously purged this has already started to show its ugly face with threats being thrown at critics of the government with a people caged in squalor and poverty their patience is fast reaching its limitation this farcical order is dying sooner than we expected the cynics who scorned predictions of the farce not lasting longer than six years are silently eating their words our responsibility is to ensure that the inevitable break in the point of stasis by the

stagnation is also happening at a time when benefits such as dental care and defined benefit pension plans are being pared back or even eliminated by employers giving those older generations an even bigger financial leg up laziness isn t the culprit here millennials are working and working hard in fact they re actually participating in the labour force more and by some measures working harder

impressive considering the size of the demographic today there are as many as 10 million people now in the millennial generation accounting for 27 5 per cent of canada s population that sheer size makes them the largest generational demographic in the country it also suggests there are more people between the ages of 18 and 35 working in the labour force today than ever before still there seem to be major hurdles in their path play for the home team housing was the top issue cited by millennials in six surveys done by abacus last year coletto says of those who don t own a home currently 86

story of this cohort we have a situation where housing is much more expensive so they have to compromise on either renting or they have to switch to condominiums or smart houses or they might buy a car and stay with their parents in the 1960s census data suggest as few as eight per cent of canadians ages 18 to 35 were living with parents today as has been well documented those numbers have skyrocketed come 2016 a total of 34 7 per cent of canadians between the ages of 20 and 34 were living at home with their parents that s as many as 3 5 million canadians the highest number recorded to

found how will they do it a national survey by hsbc bank of canada released in 2017 found 37 per cent of millennials who have purchased a home received some of the money for the purchase from their parents the education system basically failed them the only thing that is helping them is their parents said tal from the cibc the education system basically failed them they are highly educated but they are not educated in what s relevant there is a mismatch between the skills that they have and what the economy needs and therefore you have many people underemployed and or trying to compromise advertisement 9 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content there is no denying that millennials are highly educated a study released by the pew research center in the u s suggests that they make up the most highly educated generation ever produced more than 3 5 million canadians between the ages of 20 and 34 reported having some sort of post secondary education including bachelor degrees and post graduate certificates and diplomas in the 2016 census but the degree by itself isn t proving to be enough it s not an option about whether or not they re going to have an education that s like an invitation card to the party said carleton university s linda duxbury a professor in management sciences at the sprott school of

photo by darren brown ottawa citizen duxbury described the situation like an arms race for qualifications to set a candidate apart from their competitors so they can land a good job and start their lives the problem is the process is forcing them to put their actual life on hold the thing about this generation is that everything is delayed said duxbury they stay in school longer they get married later if you start comparing the average age of marriage the average age of their first kid the average age of their first permanent full time job it s also forcing those within the generation to compete with one another in ways that are specifically benefitting employers with so much talent available competition for available entry levels jobs is fierce this allows employers to pay less for the workers they need some are even getting away with not paying their employees at all advertisement 11 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content according to the canadian federation of students as many as 300 000 millennials were working in unpaid internships in a bid to further their careers by collecting relevant on the job experience in 2016 the issue with unpaid internships is that most millennials in those jobs are also working in another position likely one that pays minimum wage in order to make ends meet according to the cfs the organization which lobbies on behalf of students also pointed to statistics canada data that shows in 1997 the first year that wage data was collected only 640 000 canadians were making the minimum wage or less in 2017 that number sat at 1 02 million almost double the number previously recorded further compounding the issues facing the millennials is the steady drop in government support offered to post secondary institutions according to the cfs government provided more than 80 per cent of university operating revenues in 1982 that figure fell below 60 per cent in 2012 the most recent year for which statistics are available the cfs says government support has continued to fall in more recent years advertisement 12 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded

to students exiting post secondary institutions with record amounts of debt using data from statistics canada the cfs said that average student debt levels have increased more than 40 per cent between 1999 and 2012 those levels have continued to climb in more recent years the increased cost of education at a time when obtaining a degree has never been more important is another hot button issue for millennials the underemployed generation underemployment a term used to describe people who are overqualified for the positions they find themselves in is also rising rapidly advertisement 13 story

article content photo by julie oliver postmedia it s tough and competitive she said even for a lot of the programs you are looking at applying to to get an actual career the amount of hours of experience you need for example the physician assistant program that i applied to it s only offered by three universities in canada and i couldn t apply to the third which is the university of toronto because they require almost 1 000 hours of health care experience so where am i supposed to get that hypothetically what i m doing now could count but most people applying to that it s their second career they re going to be older in america where numbers are more readily available underemployment held steady at around 33 per cent of all post secondary graduates between the 1980s and 2010

ability to keep up financially income inequality has become more entrenched as lower income ontarians are increasingly staying in low income and higher income ontarians are increasingly staying in

incomes raise important questions about the role of government in ensuring that all individuals have access to similar economic opportunities he said abacus s coletto is seeing signs that the trend exists here in canada too one of the key indicators of underemployment is wages which would be reflected in the rise of minimum wage workers but the other big indicator is the benefits offered by employers self employed people largely don t have access to benefits people making minimum wage get a minimum amount of benefits from their employers only 55 per cent of millennials have access to a prescription drug plan 53 per cent to dental insurance 36 per cent to an rrsp and only 29 per cent to an employer provided pension plan according to a recent study released by abacus data

when he came back from the war had a grade 12 education when he retired he was vice president at 3m why because there was a different attitude then is it harder to buy a home yes are we taking on higher student debt yes have we been trained and educated in the wrong things many of us yes said abacus s coletto we ve been raised around these expectations go do what you want to do the world is your oyster dream big those expectations were set quite high when you enter a world where it s not possible to achieve the things that your parents and your teachers and society has been saying is going to be there it creates further tension advertisement 19 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content baby boomers won t go can t go the tension is being compounded by the baby boomer generation s refusal to leave the workforce if the millennials are stuck in a bottleneck fighting for career advancement right now the baby boomers are acting like a cork preventing any movement whereas the age 65 was once marked by a person s announcing their retirement today s senior citizens are opting to soldier on the idea of freedom at 55 seems long forgotten extended life spans better health and in some cases continued financial responsibilities are seeing many people in the baby boomer demographic work well into their 70s before opting for retirement boomers have significant expenses that perhaps they didn t anticipate plus they love their jobs and they re healthy they think what am i going to do for the next 25 years said duxbury advertisement 20 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content duxbury also said that baby boomers are now finding themselves in a situation where they are caring for or paying for the care of their aging parents many also find themselves sandwiched in between paying for their parents while also supporting their millennial children who have returned to the family home the millennials can t afford to leave their parents homes because they don t have the opportunity or means to do so but their parents can t afford to retire which would open spaces in the workforce for millennials because they are still supporting those kids at home it is a problem that the boomers aren t leaving that s absolutely true said duxbury so what comes next the awakening of the millennial tectonic plates are beginning to shift advertisement 21 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content that s the opinion at least of karen foster assistant professor at dalhousie university and canada research chair in sustainable rural futures for atlantic canada one of foster s areas of expertise is in researching generational divisions at work she said there is no doubt millennials are upset and that their complaints have been falling on deaf ears however one of the larger issues that millennials are facing is a growing wealth gap between themselves and older generations due to the fact that major life milestones have been delayed investments in real estate or other financial transactions aren t yielding the same return for the younger generation foster said sure property values have skyrocketed for older generations who bought when prices were affordable and have been hanging onto the property but the millennial who just purchased is seeing bigger mortgages than ever before and interest rates that are steadily rising advertisement 22 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content critics of millennial concerns have often pointed out that are next in line to inherit massive amounts of wealth that has been accumulated by their aging parents in fact between 2016 and 2026 the largest wealth transfer in history is expected to take place as older generations pass on as much as 1 trillion to younger generations in canada according to toronto based research firm strategic insight but foster pointed out one critical problem with the upcoming windfall the expected transfer of wealth will only benefit those people who come from families that are already wealthy it will also affect people from major canadian cities where property prices have been steadily rising in a much different way than those people from less populated towns if your family is from somewhere such as moncton n b moose jaw sask or sudbury ont you won t see the same windfall when it comes time to collect an inheritance advertisement 23 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content people who are set to inherit money from their parents or in a sense have been inheriting it their whole lives through various kinds of support that s where the real inequality happens she said adding that millennials are looking to completely upend the status quo that really comes down to a restructuring of the tax system we need to be taxing wealth and high incomes and corporate profits more in order to redistribute wealth across the demographics foster predicts that millennials are likely to push for things such as increased estate taxes in order to ensure that some of the wealth that is transferred from older generations is redistributed throughout all of society the idea is being spearheaded in the united states by recently elected democrat congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez ocasio cortez who at 29 is also a millennial is lobbying for the introduction of a tax on the wealthiest americans in the country she believes that every dollar of income over 10 million should be taxed at 70 per cent advertisement 24 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content there will of course be pushback to that idea it s been panned by the audience at the world economic forum in davos switzerland as recently as last week with attendees including michael dell founder of dell technologies and microsoft corp founder bill gates expressing objections the call for higher estate taxes in canada was recently reinforced in a study released by the canadian centre for policy alternatives ccpa you d expect canada s tax regime would try to counteract this concentration of wealth at the very top where it s needed the least but in fact federal policies encourage it said the centre s senior economist david macdonald in a release canada is the only country in the g7 without an inheritance estate or gift tax on tremendous family wealth advertisement 25 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the ccpa s report said canada s wealthiest families saw their net worth grow on average by 37 per cent between 2012 and 2016 middle class families saw their net worth grow by only 16 per cent during the same time frame the study calls for high estate taxes eliminating tax preferences for capital gains and dividend income in a bid to better distribute wealth across demographics that may sound like a scary scenario to older generations who have amassed wealth throughout their lifetimes and typically been more conservative when it comes to political fiscal policies but for the millennial generation it s only the tip of the iceberg bring the big government according to abacus data millennials are looking to government to take big steps to fix their problems this generation is more comfortable with big interventionist government than allowing market forces to play their part surveys suggest many millennials truly believe that the economic system that has been in place for hundreds of years fails to work for them advertisement 26 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the company s research suggests that millennials clearly prioritize increased government spending over balanced budgets in order to tackle issues such as alleviating income inequality they believe corporations don t pay their fair share of taxes and that government has a big role to play in redistributing that money having lived through the 2008 financial crisis and a rise in housing costs many are outright skeptical of the free market when asked to indicate if they lean more towards one perspective or the other only 46 per cent suggested that capitalism is the best economic model we have while 54 per cent believe canada would be better off with a more socialist system reads an abacus data survey released last year perhaps the most pertinent fact millennials are now the largest block of voters in the country and have the ability to swing an election toward the party or platform of their choice provided the generation gets out the vote so far they have remained relatively quiet in most elections politicians aren t talking about issues that they care about they aren t very compelling they aren t giving them a reason to get engaged said abacus s coletto millennials are unique from previous generations particularly the boomers and those who came before the boomers in that voting is not considered a duty we don t do it because we have to we do it because we have a reason to reasons seem to be emerging according to elections canada 38 8 per cent of eligible voters between the ages of 18 and 24 years of age voted in the 2011 federal election of those between 25 and 34 years of age 45 1 per cent cast their ballot by comparison a total of 64 5 per cent of canadians between the ages of 45 and 54 voted in that election when it came to canadians between the ages of 65 and 74 a total of 75 1 per cent of eligible voters participated the federal election in 2015 saw better turnout by millennials more than 57 1 per cent of eligible voters between 18 and 24 years of age cast a ballot the number was similar in the 25 through 34 year old age group where 57 4 per cent of eligible voters participated one of the big issues during the 2015 election was the liberal party s promise to legalize cannabis sales in canada which is something that appeals specifically to the millennial generation s interests more than 60 per cent of canadians between the ages of 18 and 34 supported legalizing cannabis according to a study released by nrg research group and peak communicators in march 2017 photo by chris young the canadian press it s expected that more politicians will be looking to woo the millennial vote heading into october s federal election last week finance minister bill morneau said the federal government is looking at ways to make housing purchases more affordable for millennials in the months ahead he called the issue a priority but didn t elaborate ndp leader jagmeet singh has said his party would propose measures to help build as many as 500 000 affordable housing units across the country if elected with more politicians tuning into the fact that the millennial generation will vote for political platforms that speak to their agenda the 18 through 35 demographic looks as though it will soon find itself in an unfamiliar position instead of taking a back seat while older generations plot the course millennials are poised to grab the wheel and take a drastic detour it hasn t boiled over yet but the pot is starting to get warm said coletto there are more millennials than there are boomers more millennials are eligible to vote than any other generation more politicians are mindful of the shift that millennials could bring meanwhile barrett is taking things in stride i ve seen a fair amount of challenges our generation may seem to think that we go through more but i think that every generation goes through some kind of hardships when it comes to finance or jobs it doesn t make things worthwhile if they re just handed to you it s

the balance of power away from president maduro the us is backing the opposition leader and could send troops as pressure increases for maduro to step down strong us economic indicators and lower oil supply after the us sanctioned venezuelan exports were a positive for crude the opec cut agreement is also limiting supply offsetting the rise of us production but still vulnerable to lower global growth forecasts the positive news out of washington on us china trade relations could send crude high but only if there is a major breakthrough announced soon content is for general information

forget about china s so called debt trap diplomacy it s a mere mousetrap compared to the jaws of two more vicious traps that are waiting to close on the global economy one is the generalised public and private sector debt trap and the other is the more insidious qe quantitative easing trap both have been masked by the high profile threat of trade and economic wars between the world s two biggest economies the united states and china for all the hundreds or even thousands of headlines that trade wars have grabbed the qe and debt traps have been lucky to get even a handful but things are about to change and growing awareness of this fact meant that davos man was a more worried man this year as the world s wealthiest tried to drown their fears in champagne at the swiss resort the spectre of an impending debt crisis was invoked far more frequently than in past years in advanced countries public debt is at levels not seen since the second world war emerging market public debt has levels last seen during the 1980s debt crisis the imf said and billionaire investor seth klarman warned that debt markets might refuse loans or demand penal interest rates before long the debt and qe traps are intimately connected waves of quantitative monetary easing in the us japan and europe may have saved the world from systemic financial collapse and economic depression after 2008 but the historically low interest rates they engendered has led to universal over borrowing there was no master plan to deal with this problem policymakers were too panicked as us and other mega banks lurched on the brink of collapse and the engines of the global economy began to flame out they flew on a wing and prayer hoping that growth or even inflation would somehow take care of things it hasn t and now the lack of an exit strategy from unconventional monetary policy or monetary excess is catching up with the world the fed has tried exiting by stealth but has been forced to back track as wall street slumped while japan is so far sunk in qe as to have no obvious way out meanwhile the vice is tightening various warnings have been sounded but none clearer than by moody s investors service which suggests that global credit conditions will weaken and risks rise this year as economic growth slows funding costs rise liquidity tightens and market volatility returns just why so many economists and policymakers have been so complacent and for so long about the consequences of monetary easing remains something of a mystery it was never really clear how the trillions of dollars injected into banking systems under qe were supposed to be mopped up without ensuing trauma the qe largesse didn t go into investment and consumption but it did prop up financial institutions that were swaying on the edge of the abyss and it found its way into financial and property assets to an extent that sent their prices soaring creating a wealth effect in the process such asset bubbles are not good news because they create vulnerability to major price corrections as well as increasing wealth inequalities via stock and other asset prices this is the real reason the us federal reserve has been raising rates incrementally rather than any fears over rising inflation however the world biggest economy is now well and truly stuck in the qe trap and jerome powell s latest promise that the fed will be patient with further rate hikes and flexible with the pace of balance sheet normalisation shows just how scared he is about tightening the trap any further if that sounds like good news it isn t it means the us economy is flying on one engine monetary accommodation having shut down the other one trade expansion president trump will now be forced to turn to fiscal expansion as the economy slows and the fed will be forced to supply more treasury funds japan s huge qe by far the biggest relative to gdp than that of the us or europe is meanwhile being exposed for what it really is an exercise in restraining the value of the yen and keeping the japanese government well supplied with funds to prop up the world s third biggest economy china s economy doesn t face a qe trap as such but it definitely is in a debt trap like the fed which was hoping that no one will notice while it tightens by stealth chinese monetary authorities are being forced to go easy on debt discipline in a slowing economy putting off today s problem until tomorrow all this might appear to be reducing the threat of a debt crisis but again it isn t really to quote moody s funding costs are increasing for corporates and liquidity is weakening for high yield companies in particular while earnings growth will be moderate amid slowing economic growth the qe bluff has been called and financial markets know now that they can force monetary authorities to extend or increase stimulus simply by throwing a taper tantrum but this knowledge is no substitute for a safe and sound economy and financial markets also know now that there is no real safety net beneath them source south china morning post

ifrs measures and definitions throughout this press release the company refers to a number of measures that the company believes are meaningful in the assessment of the company s performance all these metrics are nonstandard measures under international financial reporting standards ifrs and are unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies readers are cautioned that the disclosure of these items is meant to add to and not replace the discussion of financial results or cash flows from operations as determined in accordance with ifrs for a discussion of the purpose of these non ifrs measures please refer to the company s q2 f2019 md a on sedar at www sedar com these measures as well as their method of calculation or reconciliation to ifrs measures are as follows 1 acv base net acv retention and acv from new customers as the majority of the company s customer contracts are sold under multiyear term licenses there is a significant lag between the timing of the billing and the associated revenue recognition as a result the company focuses on the aggregate annualized value of its subscriptions under contract measured by annual contract value as an indicator of its future revenues the acv base measures the amount of recurring annual revenue absolute will receive from its commercial customers under contract at a point in time and therefore is an indicator of the company s future revenue streams net acv retention measures the percentage increase or decrease in the commercial acv base at the end of a period for the customers that made up the commercial acv base at the beginning of the same period this metric provides insight into the effectiveness of absolute s customer retention and expansion functions acv from new customers measures the addition to the commercial acv base from sales to new commercial customers during the quarter we believe that increases in the amount of acv from new customers and improvement in the company s net acv retention will grow our commercial acv base and in turn our future revenues 2 adjusted ebitda management believes that analyzing operating results exclusive of significant noncash items or items not controllable in the period provides a useful measure of the company s performance the term adjusted ebitda refers to earnings before deducting interest and investment gains losses income taxes amortization of intangible assets and property and equipment foreign exchange gain or loss share based compensation and restructuring and reorganization charges and post retirement benefits the items excluded in the determination of adjusted ebitda are share based compensation amortization of intangibles amortization of property and equipment and restructuring and reorganization charges and certain post retirement benefits 3 adjusted operating expenses a number of significant noncash or nonrecurring expenses are reported in the company s cost of revenue and operating expenses management believes that analyzing these expenses exclusive of these noncash or nonrecurring items provides a useful measure of the cash invested in the operations of its business the items excluded in the determination of adjusted operating expenses are share based compensation amortization of intangible assets amortization of property and equipment and restructuring and reorganization charges and certain post retirement benefits for a description of the reasons these items are adjusted please refer to the non ifrs measures section of the q2 f2019 md a about absolute absolute empowers more than

the dollar s status as the world s reserve currency and the vast us government bond market ensures the federal reserve s status as the dominant central bank its policy decisions and guidance matter immensely particularly for emerging market economies that have plenty of dollar denominated debt to service a u turn on monetary policy this week from the fed has been billed by some as a twin capitulation to both financial markets and president donald trump s incessant demands that it should stop raising interest rates such critiques miss the burning issue a decade after the financial crisis the global economy is slowing much faster than expected and debt levels have ballooned particularly in em and in the corporate world many investors still pin their hopes on beijing stimulating economic activity this year but do so as china is enduring a credit crunch and trying to prevent a trade war with washington with this backdrop it s hardly a shock that in just over a month the fed has switched from signalling further rate increases to this week s emphasis that patience is now its watchword the fed s commitment to a patient approach towards interest rates and the willingness voiced this week to consider stemming the speed at which the balance sheet is shrinking mean the central bank is now sitting on the sidelines moderating inflation pressure helps provide it a cover to do so even while as this week s employment report reminded everyone the us jobs market remains healthy instead of seeing the fed s pause as a cave in to the recent market turmoil investors should focus on what made policymakers reverse course so quickly aside from economic weakness in china the eurozone and japan the fed faces a us economy experiencing signs of late cycle weakness especially in housing at the same time corporate earnings growth expectations for the first half of this year have been cut significantly to the low single digits given the mammoth scale of corporate borrowing in recent years the ability of companies to grow their earnings has been a critical cushion it s a cushion that is now deflating the large drop in corporate bond prices during december s rout appears to have left a mark with the fed as it should us stocks may have enjoyed their best january since 1987 but the premium investors are demanding to buy credit has widened sharply over the past 12 months and remains near a level seen in 2016 according to the moody s baa index the fed s actions this week amounts to a ratification of the concerns that markets flagged during a turbulent fourth quarter last year listening to markets and detecting signs of trouble before they hurt the broader economy is exactly what central banks should do there s plenty of justified criticism about the fed failing to appreciate the extent of the mortgage and credit bubble that some saw building before 2007 my question to a fed official in may that year about the sharp rise in repo funding via banks that left them very reliant on short term funding was dismissed at the time as a poor way to gauge the leverage within the financial system asset prices matter for modern economies that function thanks to hefty amounts of borrowing since the us central bank s former chairman alan greenspan initiated the now famous fed put with rate cuts after black monday in 1987 policymakers have remained ever ready to step in and support markets this happened in 1998 then during 2001 and again after 2008 with the new ammunition of quantitative easing creating breathing room for global markets is usually achieved via a weaker dollar and judging by the bullish response in emerging markets the fed has helped china this week with the renminbi touching a six month high on thursday there is scope for china to ease interest rates without unleashing a much weaker currency that would only complicate beijing s stimulus efforts clearly fed officials are worried by market turmoil infecting the broader economy they are also concerned about clouds in the form of trade frictions china s financial crunch high levels of corporate leverage lacklustre us earnings growth and brexit the coming weeks should offer more clarity on trade as well as on the health of the us and global economies in this context treasuries and other major sovereign bond markets will be important barometers to watch the us bond market is doing more than telling us that the fed has just paused it s suggesting that the central bank is at the very early stages of a pivot towards the next easing cycle this week yields on the two and five year notes dipped below 2 50 percent the upper band of the current overnight federal funds rate lower yields in developed world bond markets will support risk assets and together with a weaker dollar there are already signs of money chasing high yielding em currencies as the carry trade finds a renewed spring in its step what should give investors pause for thought is a further decline in top tier bond yields and inflation expectations which would suggest the fed has misjudged the cycle and already tightened policy too far as seen during the second half of 2000 and 2007 us treasury yields do send a message that deserves to be listened to
strong markets make region the world s main driver of fdi growth jakarta southeast asia is bucking the global trend of falling direct foreign investment as the low cost fast growing region solidifies its position as an attractive location for multinationals james dyson s recent decision to relocate the headquarters of his eponymous technology business to singapore is not about brexit the company said rather the british tycoon said he is looking to a region that continues to exhibit solid growth future proofing as his chief executive termed it the move follows an october announcement that dyson famous for its vacuum cleaners will make electric vehicles in singapore citing the city state s proximity to high growth markets in emerging asia where annual gross domestic product could grow by 6 1 between now and 2023 according to the organization for economic cooperation and development asia received a third of global investment in 2018 and accounted for nearly all the year s investment growth according to the united nations conference on trade and development this is despite global foreign direct investment fdi declining 19 in 2018 japanese retailer aeon opened a second large mall in cambodia in june as part of its regional expansion plans which this year will include new shopping centers in hanoi and bogor indonesia as for south east countries generally speaking they have been showing rapid economic growth and will keep their pace in future too an aeon asia spokesperson said u s motorcycle maker harley davidson braved the wrath of president donald trump for allegedly

the region as a whole elsewhere in asia u s retailer walmart bought an 18 billion stake in indian e tailer flipkart while china and brunei are involved in a 15 billion petrochemical project in the oil rich sultanate taco bell said it plans hundreds of new restaurants around asia vietnam last month announced that swedish furniture maker ikea will sink almost a half a billion dollars into a retail and warehouse project in hanoi though the company said the amount of investment has not been finalized in vietnam we believe we can make a positive contribution to its many people with our offer of well designed functional home furnishings at low prices an ikea spokesman said we are open to growing our operations in vietnam and the region as a whole these are just some of the deals that reflect emerging asia s status as the world s top investment draw of the 694 billion in fdi that went to developing economies last year 502 billion found its way to developing asia and although the u s was the most favored destination five of the top 10 fdi recipients were in the asia pacific region china hong kong singapore australia and india but southeast asia was the world s main fdi growth engine last year according to unctad with inflows up 11 to a record 145 billion not only did fdi in the region top that of europe it was slightly more than what china received and almost three times as much as south asia southeast asia is in a unique position said pushan dutt a professor at the insead business school in singapore it offers favorable demographics fast growth low costs and relatively good governance next all global value chains run through asia which makes southeast asia in particular attractive to multinationals thailand long a draw for manufacturing investors pulled in 11 billion last year nearly four times as much as the previous year vietnam received a record 19 billion in fdi about half the southeast asia bound fdi went to singapore the city state is an attractive investment destination thanks to its business friendly regulatory environment and strong macroeconomic performance said soon ghee chua head of the southeast asia unit at a t kearney which publishes an annual global fdi confidence index singapore also provides investors with easier access to the surrounding emerging markets said cedric chehab head of country risk global strategy at fitch solutions according to the 2018 investment report published by the association of southeast asian nations 19 of fdi in southeast asia in 2017 was cross border investment within the bloc nearly 70 of this was from singapore to the nine other member states particularly commodities giant indonesia investment into indonesia however is falling the region s biggest economy saw fdi fall for a third straight quarter in the october december period the country s investment board said wednesday thomas lembong the board s chief recently blamed the slide on a lack of policy reform momentum the association also estimated that foreign investment in southeast asia s information and communications technology sector came to nearly 8 billion in 2017 twice as much as mining but only a quarter that of manufacturing in 2018 investment in the region s tech sectors reached 11 billion in 2018 with singapore and indonesia dominant according to singaporean venture capital company cento ventures while some of the drop in global fdi is attributable to u s china trade tensions the sentiment of american companies also played a role according to unctad spurred by washington s 2017 tax reforms u s multinationals repatriated billions of dollars in overseas earnings the trade tiff also appears to have multinationals with operations in china looking at lower wage alternatives in asia for their production as the cost advantage of china as factory of the world diminishes will migrate to countries such as indonesia vietnam cambodia and even myanmar said insead s dutt no doubt toward the end of 2018 some of the fdis that would have gone to china ended up in vietnam said suiwah leung associate professor at australian national university but as economies grow and wages increase countries in the region will need additional reforms and public spending if they are to retain investment many of the region s countries could do things to attract more fdi improved infrastructure is high up there with the philippines and indonesia standing out on that front said alex holmes an economist at capital economics political stability is another factor countries such as myanmar only receive limited fdi due to their political climate like other countries in the region vietnam needs to implement more reforms if it is to sustain investor interest said anu s leung follow us on twitter follow arevico

that our three year plan gap will be approximately 150 basis points the success of our plans and expectations regarding our operating performance including expectations regarding our three year financial objectives are subject to the general risks associated with our business including the risks of interruption of supplies due to lack of long term contracts severe weather crop conditions work stoppages intense competition technology disruptions dependence on large long term regional and national customers inflation risks the impact of fuel prices adverse publicity labor issues political or financial instability trade restrictions tariffs currency exchange rates transport capacity and costs and other factors relating to foreign trade any or all of which could delay our receipt of product or increase our input costs risks and uncertainties also include risks impacting the economy generally including the risks that the current general economic conditions will deteriorate or consumer confidence in the economy or consumer spending particularly on food away from home may decline market conditions may not improve competition and the impact of gpos may reduce our margins and make it difficult for us to maintain our market share growth rate and profitability we may not be able to fully compensate for increases in fuel costs and fuel hedging arrangements intended to contain fuel costs could result in above market fuel costs our ability to meet our long term strategic objectives depends on our ability to grow gross profit leverage our supply chain costs and reduce administrative costs this will depend largely on the success of our various business initiatives including efforts related to revenue management expense management our digital e commerce strategy and any efforts related to restructuring or the reduction of administrative costs there are various risks related to these efforts including the risk that if sales from our locally managed customers do not grow at the same rate as sales from regional and national customers or if we are unable to continue to accelerate local case growth our gross margins may decline the risk that we are unlikely to be able to predict inflation over the long term and lower inflation is likely to produce lower gross profit the risk that our efforts to modify truck routing including our small truck initiative in order to reduce outbound transportation costs may not be effective the risk that our efforts to mitigate increases in warehouse costs may be unsuccessful the risk that we may not be able to accelerate and or identify additional administrative cost savings in order to compensate for any gross profit or supply chain cost leverage challenges the risk that these efforts may not provide the expected benefits in our anticipated time frame if at all and may prove costlier than expected the risk that the actual costs of any initiatives may be greater or less than currently expected and the risk of adverse effects to our business results of operations and liquidity if past and future undertakings and the associated changes to our business do not prove to be cost effective or do not result in the cost savings and other benefits at the levels that we anticipate our plans related to and the timing of any initiatives are subject to change at any time based on management s subjective evaluation of our overall business needs if we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from our efforts we could become cost disadvantaged in the marketplace and our competitiveness and our profitability could decrease adverse publicity about us or lack of confidence in our products could negatively impact our reputation and reduce earnings capital expenditures may vary based on changes in business plans and other factors including risks related to the implementation of various initiatives the timing and successful completion of acquisitions construction schedules and the possibility that other cash requirements could result in delays or cancellations of capital spending periods of significant or prolonged inflation or deflation either overall or in certain product categories can have a negative impact on us and our customers as high food costs can reduce consumer spending in the food away from home market and may negatively impact our sales gross profit operating income and earnings and periods of deflation can be difficult to manage effectively fluctuations in inflation and deflation as well as fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies are beyond our control and subject to broader market forces expanding into international markets presents unique challenges and risks including compliance with local laws regulations and customs and the impact of local political and economic conditions including the impact of brexit and the yellow vest protests in france against a fuel tax increase and the french government and such expansion efforts may not be successful any business that we acquire may not perform as expected and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions expectations regarding the financial statement impact of any acquisitions may change based on management s subjective evaluation meeting our dividend target objectives depends on our level of earnings available cash and the success of our various strategic initiatives changes in applicable tax laws or regulations and the resolution of tax disputes could negatively affect our financial results we rely on technology in our business and any cybersecurity incident other technology disruption or delay in implementing new technology could negatively affect our business and our relationships with customers for a discussion

financial measures that we believe provide important perspective with respect to underlying business trends other than free cash flow any non gaap financial measures will be denoted as adjusted measures and exclude the impact from restructuring and transformational project costs consisting of 1 expenses associated with our various transformation initiatives 2 severance and facility closure charges and 3 restructuring charges the non gaap financial measures presented in this report also exclude the impact of the following acquisition related items 1 intangible amortization expense and 2 integration costs the second quarter fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 items described above and excluded from our non gaap measures are collectively referred to as certain items all acquisition related costs in fiscal 2019 and 2018 that have been excluded relate to the fiscal 2017 acquisition of cucina lux investments limited the brakes acquisition in addition with respect to the adjusted return on invested capital targets our invested capital is adjusted for the accumulation of debt incurred for the brakes acquisition that would not have been borrowed absent this acquisition management believes that adjusting its operating expenses operating income interest expense net earnings and diluted earnings per share to remove these certain items provides an important perspective with respect to our underlying business trends and results and provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that 1 is indicative of the performance of the company s underlying operations facilitating comparisons on a year over year basis and 2 removes those items that are difficult to predict and are often unanticipated and that as a result are difficult to include in analysts financial models and our investors expectations with any degree of specificity although sysco has a history of growth through acquisitions the brakes group was significantly larger than the companies historically acquired by sysco with a proportionately greater impact on sysco s consolidated financial statements accordingly sysco is excluding from its non gaap financial measures for the relevant period solely those acquisition costs specific to the brakes acquisition we believe this approach significantly enhances the comparability of sysco s results for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 the company uses these non gaap measures when evaluating its financial results as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes these financial measures should not be used as a substitute for gaap measures in assessing the company s results of operations for periods presented an analysis of any non gaap financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap as a result in the table below each period presented is adjusted for the impact described above in the table below individual components of diluted earnings per share may not add to the total presented due to rounding adjusted diluted earnings per share is calculated using adjusted net earnings divided by diluted shares outstanding sysco corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries

by rex weyler the world s youth have finally seen and heard enough from the deplorable political process from compromised delegates corrupted political appointees and criminal corporations who sabotage these critical international discussions the truth of our ecological crisis is not difficult to see fragile ecosystems are unraveling all around us we have been warned by scientists for two centuries by the 1972 limits to growth study william catton s 1980 book overshoot by reliable scientists and by millions of ecology activists we were warned by the 2009 nature article planetary boundaries showing that humanity has breached seven critical tipping points and by the 2012 nature article approaching a state shift in earth s biosphere by 22 international scientists warning of an irreversible planetary scale transition unknown in human experience and yet politicians and delegates travel around the world stay in luxury hotels and dither about our children s future as carbon emissions rise species blink from existence rivers run dry and ancient forests burn it is no wonder and a welcome sight that the world s youth have seen enough and are not impressed thirty years of pep talks on dec 12 2018 at the cop 24 un climate conference in katowice poland swedish student greta thunberg finally said what the politicized delegates have failed to say thunberg is a direct descendant of swedish chemist svante arrhenius who predicted global heating from carbon emissions in 1896 during this year s heat wave and wildfires in sweden thunberg gained world attention by staging a school strike outside the swedish riksdag holding a sign that read skolstrejk för klimatet school strike for climate she demanded that the swedish government reduce carbon emissions her actions inspired student strikes in over 270 cities around the world greta thunberg full speech at un climate change cop24 conference youtu be speaking on behalf of climate justice now thunberg chastised the delegates and member nations for failing to take action appropriate to the climate crisis until you start focusing on what needs to be done rather than what is politically possible there is no hope we can t solve a crisis without treating it as a crisis we need to keep the fossil fuels in the ground thunberg pointed out that if solutions within the system are so impossible to find maybe we should change the system itself and she spoke directly to the errors and injustice of our economic system our biosphere is being sacrificed so that rich people in countries like mine can live in luxury it is the sufferings of the many which pay for the luxuries of the few she exposed the errors of convenient but false solutions that have displaced the genuine solutions to climate change and ecological collapse you only speak of green eternal economic growth because you are too scared of being unpopular she said you only talk about moving forward with the same bad ideas that got us into this mess even when the only sensible thing to do is pull the emergency brake we ve had thirty years of pep talking and selling positive ideas she said in stockholm prior to departing for poland and i m sorry but it doesn t work because if it would have the emissions would have gone down by now they haven t meanwhile outside the conference 330 organizations from 129 countries presented six people s demands for climate justice beginning with keep fossil fuels in the ground and end subsidies to fossil fuel industry the youth leaders urged nations to reject false solutions techno fixes and offsetting schemes in favor of real solutions that are just feasible and essential they particularly called out corporations and rich nations who use the excuse of carbon sinks to seize indigenous land they called on the rich nations whose historical carbon emissions have caused the climate crisis to accept their fair share of climate reparation costs by honoring their green climate fund obligations finally the coalition demanded that un conferences end corporate interference and sabotage of the climate talks extraction corporations have been getting massively wealthy said sriram madhusoodanan from corporate accountability they re in these talks blocking real solutions and advancing false solutions that will continue to propagate their business model why thunberg is correct thunberg is correct about years decades of pep talks and positive ideas that have failed to reduce carbon emissions scientists have known about the threat of global heating since thunberg s ancestor arrhenius calculated the impact in the nineteenth century the modern world has been meeting about the crisis for almost forty years since the first world climate conference in geneva in 1979 since then human carbon emissions have doubled from about 5 gigatonnes of carbon per year gtc yr to 2018 s record breaking 10 88 gtc yr meanwhile co2 concentration in the atmosphere has grown by 22 percent from 337 parts per million ppm in 1979 to over 412 ppm today these results represent an enormous failure on the part of world governments laser projection on the cop24 venue in poland she is also correct about the unfulfilled promise of green growth a notion made popular in 2012 at the un conference on sustainable development in rio de janeiro by the world bank and the organization for economic cooperation and development both dedicated to industrial growth however recent studies show that green or sustainable growth are delusions in 2018 anthropologist jason hickel reviewed recent data and wrote in foreign policy that green growth is based more on wishful thinking than on evidence a 2012 study by german resource economist monika dittrich and colleagues showed that even under optimum conditions decoupling economic growth from resource use has not occurred the united nations environment programme came to similar conclusions in 2016 and 2017 studies they predicted that by 2050 with continued growth resource use would double to 180 billion metric tons per year gt y ecological footprint data shows that a sustainable level of resource use is about 50 gt y a limit breached in 2000 studies have consistently and rigidly linked economic growth to energy in a 2012 paper no way out the double bind in seeking global prosperity alongside mitigated climate change t j garrett at the university of utah performed the calculations and determined that every single dollar u s dollar 1990 of global economic growth in recent decades required approximately 9 7 milliwatts of energy global co2 emission rates wrote garrett cannot be decoupled from wealth through efficiency gains wealthy nations such as the uk and u s have claimed to decouple energy use from gdp but only because they have exported energy intensive industries and now import finished goods cars computers trinkets which represent massive embedded energy based on recent data thunberg is entirely correct that green growth is a delusion pull the break finally thunberg is correct that the only paths out of our predicament require that we change the system itself global heating biodiversity loss environmental toxins nutrient cycle disruption and all other ecological challenges arise as symptoms of a single larger biophysical reality humanity is in a state of ecological overshoot there is no way to grow out of overshoot all genuine solutions to overshoot require that the species contract not grow as thunberg says it is time to face these facts to slow down and to pull the emergency brake on economic growth this is the reality that the climate conference delegates are too scared to voice our status quo economic system industrial capitalism requires growth to survive without endless economic growth the 250 trillion global debt to bankers and investors cannot be paid as thunberg says our biosphere is being sacrificed so that rich people can live in luxury the biosphere is being sacrificed so bankers can receive their interest payments to keep stock prices up and to avoid facing reality the current system is biased for the rich to get richer as multitudes suffer as the ecosystem collapses and as other species disappear economist jeremy grantham concurs in the race for our lives when he states that capitalism and mainstream economics simply cannot deal with these problems corporate sabotage of the climate talks is not new in the 1920s and 30s standard oil general motors and firestone tires acquired and sabotaged public transportation throughout north america for the purpose of replacing efficient public transport with gas guzzling cars today in nigeria ecuador canada in the arctic around the world and at these un conferences oil companies are still sabotaging the public interest for profits it gives us some measure of hope that young leaders appear to be among the few who have the courage and insight to speak the truth greta thunberg closed her short talk by announcing we have not come here to beg world leaders to care we have come here to let you know that change is coming whether you like it or not her speech stands as one of the most hopeful moments for ecological realism in recent years we need to act now 15 year old greta thunberg calls for global climate strike ecowatch ecowatch december 16 2018 rex weyler was a director of the original

increase of factory material and labor costs as a percentage of net sales in our fourth quarter looking ahead we expect demand to remain relatively stable as demand in january was strong indicating the december buying patterns may have been postponed due to short term uncertainty mrs colonias continued our strong sales for the year combined with our focus on cost containment initiatives resulted

reinforcement materials was unchanged compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018 higher volumes and the benefit from improved pricing and product mix from our 2018 tire customer agreements were offset by the unfavorable impact of lower margins in china margins in china were negatively impacted by lower pricing from weak automotive demand coupled with high inventory levels and the sharp decline of feedstock costs toward the end of the quarter globally volumes increased 1 year over year primarily due to gains in the americas and asia partially offset by lower demand in emea global and regional volume changes for reinforcement materials for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 as compared to the same quarter of the prior year are included in the table below first quarter year over year change changes in global reinforcement materials volumes 1 asia 3 europe middle east africa 8 americas 3 performance chemicals first quarter fiscal 2019 ebit in performance chemicals decreased by 11 million compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018 primarily due to lower volumes and margins and higher costs related to growth investments volumes decreased by 3 in the performance additives business and 2 in the specialty formulations business lower volumes were primarily due to the softer automotive demand in emea and china and customer destocking resulting from declining polymer prices lower margins were largely driven by the impact of high cost specialty carbons inventory that moved through our supply chain during the first quarter costs related to growth investments were primarily related to two new fumed silica plants that are scheduled to commence operations over the next twelve months purification solutions first quarter fiscal 2019 ebit in purification solutions decreased by 9 million compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018 largely due to the receipt of 5 million of royalty payments in the first fiscal quarter of 2018 which did not reoccur in 2019 and lower margins resulting from continued competitive intensity in mercury removal and other north american powdered activated carbon applications specialty fluids first quarter fiscal 2019 ebit in specialty fluids increased by 12 million compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018 primarily due to revenue associated with a higher level of project activity compared to the prior year period cash performance the company ended the first quarter of fiscal 2019 with a cash balance of 142 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 cash flows from operating activities were a use of 39 million which included a 111 million increase in net working capital capital expenditures for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 were 54 million additional uses of cash during the first quarter included 62 million for share repurchases and 20 million for dividends taxes during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 the company recorded a tax benefit of 7 million for an effective tax rate of 10 the provision includes 24 million of discrete tax benefits primarily related to an updated estimate for the impact of u s tax reform the operating tax rate was 24 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and increased from 21 in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 due to the impacts of u s tax reform legislation outlook commenting on the outlook for the company keohane said despite the current business environment we remain confident in our ability to grow earnings this fiscal year we expect customer destocking and the impact on automotive production from new emissions regulations in europe to have less of an impact in the second quarter of fiscal year 2019 than in the first quarter we anticipate that reinforcement materials will benefit from the calendar year 2019 customer agreements but will face headwinds in the second quarter from a challenging china environment and lower oil prices in performance chemicals we are expecting a meaningful ebit improvement sequentially due to volume recovery in the specialty carbons and specialty compounds businesses and a positive margin impact from lower feedstock prices keohane continued as the forecast for auto production strengthens and the china economy improves we anticipate stronger volumes and margins in the second half of our fiscal year based on the challenging first half coupled with stronger second half results we expect full year adjusted eps to be in the range of 4 20 to 4 60 to counteract the business challenges we are focused on controlling costs tightening capital expenditure and working capital levels delivering on recently negotiated customer agreements and managing pricing in this dynamic environment finally as we continue to execute our advancing the core strategy we are committed to delivering another year of strong earnings growth investing for the future in our core businesses divesting non core assets and returning cash to our shareholders earnings call the company will host a conference call with

of energy and raw materials competition from other specialty chemical companies safety health and environmental requirements a significant adverse change in a customer relationship negative or uncertain worldwide or regional economic conditions unanticipated delays in site development projects and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates and changes in global trade

our fiscal year ended september 30 2018 filed with the sec at www sec gov we assume no obligation to provide revisions to any forward looking statements should circumstances change except as otherwise required by securities and other applicable laws use of non gaap financial measures to supplement cabot s consolidated financial statements presented on a generally accepted accounting principles gaap basis the preceding discussion of our results and the accompanying financial tables report adjusted eps and our operating tax rate both of which are non gaap financial measures these non gaap financial measures are not computed in accordance with or as an alternative to gaap a reconciliation of adjusted eps to net income loss per share attributable to cabot corporation the most directly comparable gaap financial measure and a reconciliation of operating tax rate to effective tax rate the most directly comparable gaap financial measure are provided in the table titled certain items and reconciliation of adjusted eps and operating tax rate management believes these non gaap measures provide investors with greater transparency to the information used by cabot management in its financial and operational decision making allow investors to see cabot s results through the eyes of management and better enable cabot s investors to understand cabot s operating performance and financial condition adjusted eps in calculating adjusted eps we exclude from our net income loss per share from continuing operations items of expense and income that management does not consider representative of the company s business operations accordingly reporting earnings on an adjusted basis supplements the gaap measure of performance and provides additional information related to the underlying performance of the business for example certain of the items we exclude are items that we are required by gaap to recognize in one period that relate to activities extending over several periods or relate to single events that management considers to be unusual and infrequent although not necessarily non recurring we refer to these items as certain items management believes excluding these items facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period by eliminating differences caused by the existence and timing of certain expense and income items that would not otherwise be apparent on a gaap basis and evaluates the company s operating performance without the impact of these costs or benefits management also uses adjusted eps as a key measure in evaluating management performance for incentive compensation purposes the items of income and expense that we have excluded from our calculations of adjusted eps as applicable but that have been included in our gaap net income loss per share as applicable are described below global restructuring activities which included costs or benefits associated with cost reduction initiatives or plant closures and were primarily related to i employee termination costs ii asset impairment charges associated with restructuring actions iii costs to close facilities including environmental costs and contract termination penalties and iv gains realized on the sale of land or equipment associated with restructured plants or locations non recurring gains losses on foreign currency which primarily related to the impact of continued currency devaluations on our net monetary assets denominated in that currency legal and environmental reserves and matters which consisted of costs or benefits for matters typically related to former businesses or that were otherwise incurred outside of the ordinary course of business executive transition costs which included incremental charges including stock compensation charges associated with the retirement or termination of employment of senior executives of the company asset impairment charges which primarily included charges associated with an impairment of goodwill or other long lived assets acquisition and integration related charges which included transaction costs redundant costs incurred during the period of integration and costs associated with transitioning certain management and business processes to cabot s processes gains losses on sale of investments which primarily related to the sale of investments accounted for under the cost method cabot does not provide a target gaap eps growth rate range or reconciliation of the adjusted eps growth rate range with a gaap eps growth rate range because without unreasonable effort we are unable to predict with reasonable certainty the matters we would allocate to certain items including unusual gains and losses costs associated with future restructurings acquisition related expenses and litigation outcomes these items are uncertain depend on various factors and could have a material impact on gaap eps in future periods operating tax rate our operating tax rate represents the tax rate on our recurring operating results this rate excludes discrete tax items which are unusual or infrequent items that are excluded from the estimated annual effective tax rate and other tax items including the impact of the timing of losses in certain jurisdictions cumulative tax rate adjustments and the impact of the items of expense and income we identify as certain items on both our operating income and the tax provision management believes that the operating tax rate is useful supplemental information because it helps our investors compare our tax rate year to year on a consistent basis and to understand what our tax rate on current operations would be without the impact of these items explanation of terms used product mix the term product mix refers to the mix of types and grade of products sold or the mix of geographic regions where products are sold and the positive or negative impact this has on the revenue or profitability of the business or segment net

positions fiscal 2018 only iii other discrete tax items during the three months ended december 31 2018 and 2017 included changes in non us tax laws as well as various return to provision adjustments

what i m about to say may sound totally crazy at first but keep reading because i think you ll agree that it s dead on accurate there s a recession coming no that s not some chicken little the sky is falling statement far from it it s just a fact economies and financial markets always go through boom and bust cycles there are good years and lean years up years and down years this is perhaps no different than life itself few people have the perfect day every day sometimes it feels like we re on top of the world and sometimes it feels like the universe is conspiring against us according to the national bureau of economic research in fact the average length of the good period in which the economy expands during this up down cycle is 56 months that s followed by an average 11 months of economic contraction upon which the whole cycle starts again well it s been ten good years now after the worst crisis since the great depression wiped out trillions of dollars of wealth around the world most developed economies hit bottom in march 2009 and then started slowly inching their way forward again so that s technically 119 months of economic expansion which means the world is way overdue for a significant correction even if you ignore economic history there are signs everywhere nearly every major asset class around the world stocks bonds real estate etc is selling near an all time high and being priced at levels that just don t make sense the us stock market s price to earnings ratio for example which is a measure of how much investors are willing to pay for every dollar of a company s profit has rarely been higher other stock market ratios like price to revenue price to book cyclically adjusted price earnings have rarely been higher even warren buffett s preferred metric which measures the value of the entire stock market relative to the size of the economy has only been this high one other time in history just before the dot com bubble burst in 2000 just about any way you slice it the stock market is overvalued it s the same with bonds whose values rise when interest rates are low well interest rates were literally at their lowest levels in 5 000 years of human history for most of the last decade and even though rates have risen a bit in the last 2 3 years there are still trillions of dollars worth of bonds in the world that have negative yields companies whose finances are sinking faster than virginia governor ralph northam s approval ratings are still able to borrow billions of dollars at practically nothing percent even bankrupt governments are able to borrow money at unbelievable terms argentina notably borrowed billions of dollars back in 2017 by issuing a one hundred year bond bear in mind that the country had defaulted several times just in the previous few decades but countless investors with their goldfish memories still lined up and there was far more demand for the bond than argentina s government could accommodate amazingly enough just one year later the government was already having trouble making interest payments and had to request an imf bailout who could have possibly seen that coming over in the land of the free the average checking account now pays just 0 06 interest while the rate of inflation is hovering around 2 this means that anyone who tries to be responsible and save money for the future is worse off after adjusting for inflation not that anyone has any savings anyhow according to federal reserve data the median bank balance in the us is barely 3 000 while a recent survey from bankrate showed that 23 of americans have almost no savings at all meanwhile debt levels continue to rise government debt is at an all time high around the world led by the us government s prodigious 22 trillion debt far larger than the size of the entire us economy corporate debt is at an all time high student debt is at an all time high consumer debt is at an all time high mortgage debt is also at an all time high now totaling 15 3 trillion and that s because property prices have hit another all time high housing affordability meanwhile is at its lowest point in a decade you get the idea just about everything is overheated and the economy is overdue for a big correction this economic correction is inevitable it s only a question of when this year next year this is what concerns me you may remember that the last financial crisis in 2008 hit just two months before the national election in the united states the economy instantly became the only election issue that mattered it s entirely possible that this will happen a big recession and market correction hits just before the 2020 election catapulting a legion of socialists into office bear in mind that an economic crisis is like any other crisis an opportunity for politicians to capitalize on people s fear to pass dangerously ambitious legislation that wouldn t stand a chance under normal circumstances think back to 9 11 people were so panicked and terrified that they didn t notice or care that the government passed orwellian legislation like the usa patriot act well this time around there are already countless socialists clamoring for 70 tax rates wealth taxes etc and if they re swept into office by a major economic crisis they ll have free reign to pass their entire agenda higher taxes nationalized healthcare debilitating business regulations etc this is a very real possibility we re overdue for a recession and the socialist are already waiting in the wings to seize power it s strange to say but i m hoping that a recession starts soon if there s a recession this year instead of next then it would likely be over before it becomes a major election issue but as we used to say in the military hope is not a course of action and that s why i m preparing for what i think will be the greatest redistribution of wealth in modern history

the major u s index futures are pointing to a roughly flat opening on monday following the strong upward move seen last week traders may be reluctant to make significant moves after the recent strength on wall street lifted the major averages to their best levels in nearly two months uncertainty about trade talks between the u s and china may keep some traders on the sidelines along with the potential for another government shutdown amid an ongoing impasse over president donald trump s border wall the economic calendar for the week is also relatively light although traders are likely

there are all kinds of stereotypes about the people who give up their pet to a shelter they got tired of the dog after it wasn t a cute puppy any more or couldn t be bothered to cut the cat s nails so it wouldn t scratch the furniture or needed a new designer mix to match their handbag the reality is quite different forty plus million americans live in poverty they have pets and they love their pets said matthew bershadker president and ceo of the aspca given the american average of 1 8 animals per household bershadker estimated that over 25 million cats and dogs are living in poverty and he noted that 52 percent of the clients of the aspca animal hospital in nyc are living on less than 15 000 per year we see people often who are in their darkest day said lori weise of downtown dog rescue in los angeles which is dedicated to helping people keep their pets they re facing some other crisis and they happen to own a dog get talk poverty in your inbox weise s organization finds many people are at the shelter because they ve run out of options â often because they ve run out of money â and they arenâ t aware of resources to help in one aspca study 40 percent of low income pet owners surrendering an animal to a shelter said they would have kept their pet if they d had access to affordable vet care and 30 percent said the same if they could have gotten free or low cost pet food there s a growing awareness that meeting the needs of low income pet owners is central to the mission of animal rescue everywhere i go we are either involved in or are talking to people about safety net services said bershadker it s almost as if a few years back a massive light bulb went off in the animal welfare community and we stopped thinking about how to get animals out of shelters and we started thinking about how to keep animals from coming into shelters some programs have in fact been working to keep pets together with low income owners for a while and the people running them have learned some important lessons about what it takes downtown dog rescue founded in 1996 has helped keep 12 000 pets from being surrendered to shelters in south los angeles since 2013 they don t have fancy facilities just a card table and two chairs outside the shelters they partner with where they start a conversation with people who may be in a panic they re crying bawling shaking maybe they have a citation â they re scared said weise i say â if i told you i could help you would you want to get rid of your pet today â and they often say oh no i love him once they ve established that someone would rather keep their pet the counselors start to connect people to resources a volunteer handymen that will patch a fence for someone who s been cited for their dog running loose low cost training advice and crucially options for lower cost vet care in l a there are free spay and neuter services for low income pet owners as well as vets who provide a discount on services to people working with downtown dog rescue the numbers needed to help someone keep a pet often aren t huge â weise said it generally costs them less than 100 one challenge is often persuading vets to volunteer time and offer discounts a lot of them have tremendous amounts of student loans said weise the young ones are struggling weise has found that it s crucial to make it easy for vets to help they work with three main animal hospitals so no one vet is bombarded with cases they make sure billing is free of complications clients show up with written vouchers stating what downtown dog rescue is paying for and there s one point of contact for billing the organization for their monthly free clinics they handle all the organizational details tables chairs event permits outreach flyers the vets just show up do the work and leave she said we stay in our own lanes we don t give medical advice they don t do planning and outreach and it s a beautiful relationship as a national complement to the kind of work weise is doing locally the aspca is researching ways to lower the cost of vet care without diminishing quality how do we shorten diagnostic and treatment protocols asked bershadker if the vet can diagnose more quickly with fewer tests it s cheaper and if it s cheaper it s more accessible he pointed to a previous success a technical advance in performing spay neuter surgeries called the pedicle tie that s allowed vets to complete the procedure in a shorter time we stopped thinking about how to get animals out of shelters and we started thinking about how to keep animals from coming into shelters taking a broader view bershadker also thinks the field needs to take a cue from the legal world which has a discipline of community based lawyers and find a way to make that possible for vets we need to create an economy around being a community veterinarian he said there s a desire for vets to give back to their communities â we need to make it economically viable for them making basic procedures more efficient is one way of doing this more loan repayment programs for vets practicing in underserved areas like the veterinary medicine loan repayment program are another possibility it s critical that services be geographically accessible and that people are aware of them one way to address those issues and be more efficient in general is to make use of existing institutions that already reach low income people one example is the aspca s partnership with food bank for nyc to supply pet food which in its first year has distributed nearly 100 000 pounds of dog and cat food to 254 food pantries rather than recreate the distribution system that they have perfected over time we simply add pet food to that bershadker said they re happy about it because they want to serve the entire family and we re happy about it because the animals are getting fed what s more aspca puts stickers on the bags of food that inform clients about other services so now if they need low cost vet care they know where to go bershadker said that the animal welfare world needs to think creatively about partnerships like this with other systems such as child protective services domestic violence services and law enforcement you don t need to rebuild the infrastructure â it exists he said you need to attach yourself to what is there

rttnews the major u s index futures are pointing to a roughly flat opening on monday following the strong upward move seen last week traders may be reluctant to make significant moves after the recent strength on wall street lifted the major averages to their best levels in nearly two months uncertainty about trade talks between the u s and china may keep some traders on the sidelines along with the potential for another government shutdown amid an ongoing impasse over president donald trump s border wall the economic calendar for the week is also relatively light although traders are likely to keep an eye on reports on service sector activity international trade and labor productivity and costs traders may also look ahead to this week s batch of earnings news including the release of google parent alphabet s googl fourth quarter results after the close of today s trading stocks fluctuated over the course of the trading session on friday before eventually ending the day mixed despite the choppy trading the dow and the s p 500 reached their best closing levels in nearly two months the major averages finished the session on opposite sides of the unchanged line while the nasdaq fell 17 87 points or 0 3 percent to 7 263 87 the dow rose 64 22 points or 0 3 percent to 25 063 89 and the s p 500 inched up 2 43 points or 0 1 percent to 2 706 53 despite the mixed performance on the day the major averages all moved sharply higher for the week the dow jumped by 1 3 percent while the nasdaq and the s p 500 surged up by 1 4 percent and 1 6 percent respectively the dow benefited from strong gains by merck mrk exxon mobil xom and chevron cvx which moved higher after reporting better than expected fourth quarter earnings on the other hand a steep drop by amazon amzn weighed on the nasdaq after the online retail giant reported fourth quarter results that exceeded analyst estimates but forecast weaker than expected first quarter revenues traders were also digesting a report from the labor department showing much stronger than expected job growth in the month of january but also an uptick in the unemployment rate the labor department said non farm payroll employment surged up by 304 000 jobs in january compared to economist estimates for an increase of about 165 000 jobs however the report also showed the spike in employment in the previous month was downwardly revised to 222 000 jobs from the initially reported 312 000 jobs andrew hunter senior u s economist at capital economics said the jump in employment in january still provides further evidence that economic growth remains solid and that the government shutdown had little impact traders largely shrugged off the unexpected increase in the unemployment rate to 4 0 percent as the uptick reflected a rise in workers on temporary layoff as a result of the government shutdown a separate report from the institute for supply management showed growth in the manufacturing sector unexpectedly reaccelerated in january after seeing a substantial slowdown in december the ism said its purchasing managers index climbed to 56 6 in january from a revised 54 3 in december with a

horgen president and chief financial officer with that i ll turn the call over to nate nathaniel dalton chief executive officer thanks jeff and good morning everyone as we all know the fourth quarter of 2018 was challenging for us at managers due to broadly negative returns across asset classes as well as the resulting client risk aversion which impacted industry wide flows in addition the quarter had several extraordinary items that i wanted to briefly put into context our results and forward outlook first while net client cash flows were negative due to both heightened client risk aversion as well as the fourth quarter seasonality we discussed on our last call our organic growth outlook is already improving in 2019 second our business is structured differently from other asset management firms this includes not only the diversity of our business and the quality of our affiliates but also importantly our investment structure which limits our exposure to operating leverage at the affiliate level providing earning stability third we are actively positioning our business to focus on the highest growth opportunities ahead finally because we ve been disciplined in managing our balance sheet and we have the flexibility to execute on the opportunities this volatility will inevitably create now turning to the quarter amg reported economics earnings per share of 3 53 for the fourth quarter and 14 50 for the full year while q4 was down versus a year ago primarily because of lower performance fees our results for 2018 were in line with those for the full year 2017 the combination of the timing of the market declines at the very end of the year with the breadth of the declines across asset classes and while a number of our alternative strategies generate good relative performance they still had low or negative cash flow returns and therefore we realized lower performance fees than we expected as we look forward our performance fee opportunity is broad and diverse across a range of distinctive return streams with very good track records of outperformance as a result we are confident that performance fees will be a meaningful component of our future earnings growth profile as they have been in the past turning next to flows there were a couple of high level themes that shaped our quarter in general elevated market volatility in the fourth quarter increased industrywide client risk aversion which led to slowing sales activity and delayed funding in addition we had elevated levels of retail redemptions and equities and liquid alternatives due to fourth quarter seasonality which in the case of liquid alternatives was exacerbated by significant outflows from products with challenging recent performance relative to benchmark while still early in the first quarter we were off to a much better start in 2019 we take a look at our publicly available data for january our retail net flows are roughly flat and while some of that is a reversal of the q4 seasonality which was particularly acute for us in 2018 the best retail month we ve seen since last april putting this all together we expect good 2018 performance by many of our affiliates as well as improving flow trend dynamics driving much better q1 net flow results and continued improvement throughout 2019 now while it was an extraordinary quarter in terms of the breadth of negative returns and client risk aversion it s important to remain focused on the key elements of our business as we execute our growth strategy let me first start with the importance of diversity over the past decade we ve built an incredibly diverse business through both the addition of new affiliates as well as organic growth through product development and innovation by the collective efforts of amg and our affiliates today our portfolio is diverse only by asset class and product category loss of client segment geography and channel as well as by affiliate there s no single affiliate contributing more than a low teens percentage to our ebitda in the fourth quarter even with the extraordinary breadth of negative market returns we saw the benefits of the diversity of our asset mix which is approximately 40 in alternative strategies for example our blended asset mix declined by roughly 8 in the quarter compared to the 13 decline in the msci world while diversity is obviously important even more important is the ability of our affiliates to sustain high quality distinctive return streams across a broad set of asset classes with the return of volatility many of our fundamental strategies outpace their respective indices and peers in the fourth quarter as well as for the full year we believe that in general volatility is good for asset managers as we noted last quarter the data from our recently updated whitepaper the boutique premium illustrates that the long term outperformance advantage of boutique has been most significant during more volatile periods where their investment processes and disciplines are able to create significant outlook for their client this stands to reason as the elements that drive superior alpha generation by boutiques in the first place and investment led entrepreneurial culture meaningful equity ownership by the investment professionals and a long duration alignment with clients and partners all supporting long term perspective which encourages these firms to maintain their investment processes through volatile periods we re already seeing this reflected in our business as the fourth quarter provided a more favorable environment for the highest quality asset managers such as our affiliates that distinguish themselves while outperformance was broadly diversified across affiliates and geographies global us and up and down the cap range this outperformance was most prominent at some of our world class value firms such as tweedy browne yacktman veritas beutel and river road the combination of market volatility and very significant outperformance is leading to a noticeable uptick in client interest and demand across channel in addition to our strong performance across many fundamental equity strategies a number of our liquid alternative products that affiliates such as aqr capula artemis efm and winton posted strong relative returns which should position them to raise assets going forward while performance across our existing products and capabilities is critically important we and our affiliates have been continuously innovating and developing new products with diverse distinctive returns streams to match evolving needs across all market environments as we talked about in our last call we have a differentiated product development approach we benefit from product development that happens within our affiliates as well as from products we develop jointly with affiliates of course our unique opportunity to add immediately saleable products with proven track record in order to invest with them this unique product development opportunity has been successful in creating a significant number of new products in the last five years including some of our fastest growing products examples are many and diverse across our traditional management firms such as artemis and timesquare are launching entire product suites of global international and emerging market strategies in the case of gwk they re building out an equity franchise domestic and global as well as most recently adding trilogies to proven emerging markets within liquid alternatives firms such as blue mountain capula and first quadrant are taking advantage of market opportunities to build out ranges of systematic product in areas such as alternative credit market neutral global macro and volatility our illiquid alternative managers also continue to diversify their product offering with pantheon offering infrastructure real asset and credit bearing asia extending into credit and real estate products and the introduction of credit direct lending and operating capabilities at eig lastly aqr continues to innovate its existing equity and alternatives franchises and is in the early innings of what could be a very significant systematic fixed income buildout alongside this product development opportunities our unique distribution strategy which combines the focused resources of each of our affiliates with the scope and scale of amg s global distribution platforms is an increasingly valuable component of our overall growth strategy this model affords our affiliates the opportunity to diversify their distribution capabilities and bring their spending products to the most appropriate pools of capital worldwide moreover as leading clients worldwide and the intermediaries who serve them are consolidating their relationships with external managers looking for more efficient relationships and even partnership with a smaller number of investment management firms amg and our unique model are beginning to capitalize on those trends and we can bring to bear the largest collection of independently managed distinctive return streams in the world as we discussed last quarter we ve been making progress and formalizing some of these relationships for example we entered into a strategic relationship with nordea asset management where we will work together to develop and place certain amg affiliate strategies on their european and latin american platforms simply put we re collectively leveraging our affiliates in manufacturing and product design and structuring work with nordea s strong brand scale packaging and distribution expertise in a strategic and addictive way to our existing efforts in these regions we are currently very active in working on a number of near term opportunities with them as well as the operational elements of this relationship as we discussed on previous calls while this is a relatively new initiative for amg we re making good progress toward establishing a range of these strategic relationships with something more formal and some less so finally as we also discussed in recent quarters we ve been actively reviewing our business to identify opportunities to improve efficiency in general and in particular to make sure that amg and their affiliates resources are focused on the risk adjusted return opportunities in the market at the affiliate level we continue to support the positioning of their businesses for future opportunities in some cases this has included strategic activity such as the combination of trilogy and their emerging markets investing team in the gwk resulting in enhanced opportunities for their collective clients and increasing both the growth opportunity and efficiency for gwk and amg as jay will explain further in a moment we also reduced operating expenses at amg and work with many of our affiliates including where we participate in categories of expenses to help them ensure they are aligning the infrastructures of their business with the opportunities and challenges they see ahead now in addition to these elements of organic growth in our existing business we have another complementary growth engine amg s business model provides a significant opportunity to generate increased earnings as well as to add immediately saleable products through investments in excellent new affiliates amg s equity ownership succession solution is very attractive to asset management boutiques that value their independence want a permanent solution and access the scale of distribution platforms we continue to actively develop our proprietary relationships with leading boutiques while the volatility of the fourth quarter inevitably impacted some discussions and more broadly the pace of activity is inherently based on the dynamics of each prospective affiliate we have a good pipeline of high quality new prospects but we remain disciplined on pricing and alignment particularly at this stage of the cycle in addition as jay will describe further we continue to position our balance sheet to prioritize flexibility and prudent financial leverage in anticipation of continued market volatility which in our experience often creates the most compelling investment opportunity in addition to maintaining the financial flexibility to invest in new affiliates and continuing to execute on the other elements of our growth strategy we also remain committed to consistently returning capital to our shareholders and we demonstrated this disciplined approach to capital allocation again in the fourth quarter finally while these are volatile signs we built our business with diversity across multiple dimensions asset class geography channel and affiliates across this diversity we have very high quality distinctive return streams managed by extraordinarily experienced investment teams we also have a unique strategy with low operating leverage as you think about the revenue sharing model which underpins a significant majority of our business and we have prudent financial leverage these characteristics differentiate from other asset management firms while providing stability as volatility continues but also importantly position us to take advantage of the opportunities this volatility will inevitably create now before i turn to jay i want to congratulate him on his appointment to president and thank him for his significant contributions as an integral member of amg s senior team for many years but in particular i wanted to acknowledge his hard work and the true partnership he brought to shawn and to me through the ceo transition shawn and i are looking forward to working with him in his new role as we grow our business and create long term shareholder value with that i ll turn it to jay jay horgen president and chief financial officer good morning and thank you nate for your kind comments i echo the sentiment and i look forward to contributing in my new expanded role as nate discussed amg s fourth quarter results were impacted by client risk aversion and declining markets especially in the last two months of the year as reflected in both our net client cash flows for the quarter as well as our annual earnings contribution from performance fees we also had a number of one time items in the quarter which i will describe in a moment in contrast to december we have seen a marked improvement in both client cash flows and markets in january additionally we are beginning to realize the benefits from expense management actions taken in the fourth quarter finally with an uplift in markets and a new calendar year we expect material growth and the contribution of performance fees to our earnings in 2019 on flows generally we experienced a higher level of redemptions from seasonality in the fourth quarter than in prior years which included tax loss harvesting and selling ahead of year end mutual fund distributions in the retail channel as well as the expiration of annual liquidity lockup and single and multi year vehicles in both the institutional and high net worth channel taken together in the fourth quarter we estimate the effect of seasonality and our quarterly flows which was exacerbated by the market environment to be between 7 billion and 9 billion in addition elevated volatility in the fourth quarter increased industrywide client risk aversion which led to slowing sales activity and delayed funding especially in the institutional channel looking ahead the first quarter typically brings a reversal to positive seasonal factors in our net client cash flow additionally improvement in our fundamental equity performance is already contributing to positive publicly visible flows thus far in january turning to our flows by asset class and starting with alternatives which account for 40 of our aum we reported outflows of 9 5 billion driven by our liquid alternative strategies and partially offset by positive contributions from our illiquid product set our illiquids which include strategies such as global and regional private equity co investment credit real asset infrastructure and real estate had a solid level of funding in the fourth quarter we continue to see a steadily growing opportunity in illiquid as our affiliates build further on existing and new product capabilities amg s aggregate performance in illiquids is very strong with 92 of our recent funds outperforming industry benchmarks on a net ir basis and 82 outperforming on a net multiple basis in our liquid alternatives category encompassing our multi strategy systematic diversified and fixed income and equity relative value strategies we saw significant outflows as a result of challenging recent relative performance which was exacerbated by seasonality especially in the retail channel in the last two months of the year our long term investment performance in liquid alternatives remain strong with 56 and 82 of our assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over a three and five year period respectively now turning to equities which account for 46 of our aum in the global equities category we saw net outflows of 3 billion in the quarter almost entirely driven by emerging market products amg continues to generate good long term aggregate performance in this category with approximately 56 of our assets under management ahead of benchmarks over a five year period notwithstanding that our three year number was impacted by challenging performance in emerging market products among our affiliates in this category are some of the industry leading global and emerging market managers who continue to have excellent competitive position in us equities we reported net outflows of 3 9 billion due to fourth quarter seasonality and macro industry trends however looking at our public flows for january we re beginning to see the benefits of significantly improved performance in this category a number of our largest fundamental value equity managers are top quartile performers on a relative basis we now have 51 of our aum outperforming benchmarks on a three year basis in us equities a notable improvement relative to prior years turning to the multi asset and other category which accounts for 14 of our aum and encompasses multi asset and balance mandates within our wealth management business as well as a number of specialty fixed income and multi asset products here we posted 600 million in net inflows primarily driven by our systematic fixed income product which continued to generate good slow momentum as well as our wealth management where a positive demand trends remain in place now turning to our financials as you saw in the release economics per share decreased by 25 to 3 53 for the fourth quarter including 0 15 of net performance fees this decline was largely due to a decrease in net performance fees down from 1 09 a year ago on a gaap basis we reported earnings per share of 2 88 reflecting the reduction in carrying value of systematica for the fourth quarter aggregate fees decreased 27 to 1 2 billion from a year ago and the ratio of aggregate fees to average assets under management declined year over year from 82 basis points to 63 basis points entirely driven by lower performance fees notably the ratio advisory fees to average assets under management remain flat year over year adjusted ebitda decreased 47 to 191 3 million from a year ago primarily due to the timing and impact of negative markets at the very end of 2018 which led to significantly lower performance fees and other income for the year in addition ebitda was lower due to a number of non recurring expenses including fourth quarter items related to expense management and amg s donation to mass general hospital excluding these one time items our fourth quarter adjusted ebitda would have been 221 million relative to adjusted ebtida the smaller year over year declines in economic net income of 29 and economics earnings per share of 25 reflected lower taxes from us tax reform a one time tax benefit from the liquidation of ivory as well as lower year over year share count due to repurchase activity in the case of economic earnings per share turning to more specific modeling items for the fourth quarter the ratio of adjusted ebitda to average assets under management was 9 9 basis points however excluding the one time expenses i previously mentioned it would have been 11 4 basis points or 10 8 basis points excluding performance fees in the first quarter we expect adjusted ebitda to average assets under management to be in the range of 11 3 basis points to 11 7 basis points reflecting a net performance fee range of 0 10 per share to 0 20 per share stepping back on performance fee guidance for the full year 2019 we expect performance fee contribution to be in the range of 0 75 to 1 75 per share this performance fee range incorporates product high water marks actual performance through january and a reasonable range around forward growth assumptions across all of our performance fee products as you know we have seasonality in our performance fee opportunity with a large majority of performance fee contracts having calendar year end crystallization and very few contracts crystallizing in the second and third quarter our share of interest expense was 18 1 million for the fourth quarter and in the first quarter we expect our share of interest expense to remain at approximately 18 million our share of reported amortization and impairments was 288 million for the fourth quarter including 261 9 million from affiliates accounted for under the equity method as you saw in the release this included the 240 million non cash charge i mentioned earlier looking ahead to the first quarter we expect our share of reported amortization and impairments to be approximately 45 million turning to taxes with regard to our tax rate in the fourth quarter our effective gaap and cash tax rates were impacted by one time items as a result our gaap tax rate was negative and our cash tax rate was 15 7 for modeling purposes we expect our gaap and cash tax rates to be approximately 26 and 18 respectively intangible related deferred taxes were 49 6 million in the fourth quarter which were elevated for the liquidation of ivory and certain other non cash items related to us tax reform for the first quarter we expect intangible related deferred taxes to be approximately 11 million other economic items were 500 000 00 for the fourth quarter and for modeling purposes we expect other economic items to be approximately 1 million per quarter our adjusted weighted average share count for the fourth quarter was 52 7 million and we expect it to be approximately 51 8 million for the first quarter turning to our balance sheet on capital management broadly speaking we have maintained a prudent level of leverage to be able to capitalize on growth opportunities even in challenging markets in addition we have continued to return capital to our shareholders within a framework of disciplined capital management during the fourth quarter in the midst of a volatile market we paid a 0 30 per share dividend and repurchased 76 million in shares while continuing to position our balance sheet including extending the maturity of our evolver and term loan looking ahead as you saw in the release we announced a first quarter dividend of 0 32 per share which reflects a 0 07 increase as well as a 3 3 million share increase to our repurchase authorization for a total of 5 million shares the first half of 2019 we expect to repurchase between 100 million and 300 million in shares however the amount and timing will depend on the potential new investment and market conditions before we take questions i d like to make one final point over the past five years we have reduced our financial leverage as part of our disciplined approach to capital management as you heard nate say amg s unique revenue share structure is in place across the large majority of our affiliate group limits our exposure to operating leverage which in periods of heightened volatility enhances the stability of our earnings this combination of prudent financial leverage and limited operating leverage gives us the flexibility to deploy capital and capitalize on our growth opportunities including in periods of market dislocation now we will be happy to answer your questions questions and answers operator thank you at this time we ll be conducting a question and answer session if you d like to ask a question please press 1 on your telephone keypad a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue you may press 2 if you d like to remove your question from the queue for participants using speaker equipment it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the key our first question comes from the line of bill katz with citigroup please proceed with your question bill katz citigroup analyst jay congratulations on the promotion maybe we can start there given the promotion i was wondering what if any change in strategy there might be or maybe just tick off the top two or three incremental things you re looking at as we think about 2019 and beyond jay horgen president and chief financial officer thank you bill you know this and i think most everyone on the phone i ve been at amg for 12 years now i ve been involved in the strategic decisions across multiple aspects of our business for some time including distribution this new role is simply an evolution of my responsibilities it s not a change or major change for our business i ve been working closely with the head of our global distribution hugh cutler has been with us for a couple of years now on a number of projects he s doing a nice job he s got a great team i look forward to helping him grow our business in this area in addition to my new responsibilities in distribution i will continue to be involved in all aspects of our business as a senior member of the team nathaniel dalton chief executive officer maybe bill i ll add something to that we talked about this a couple calls ago but we ve got an excellent senior team with a really good balanced mix of people who have been with us for a long time like jay obviously and also newer perspectives and people we ve brought in across different functional areas you know a lot of people have stepped up over this past year as we ve had some transition but it s clear we re better positioned than ever before in terms of the breadth and depth of the team we ve got finally i d say this is a good environment to attract new talent as well we ve built a really strong senior management team it s great to watch how that team continues to evolve as we execute against our strategy operator thank you we would like to request you limit yourself to one question and invite you to join the queue our next question comes from the line of robert lee with kbw please proceed with your question robert lee kbw managing director thanks you touched on capital management i m just curious how do you think of your deal capacity right now within that i understand you want to keep dry powder but have you changed at all how you think about ultimate leverage you re willing to run at if you find the right transaction i guess historically in the past you ve gone three times or more has that changed at all given the environment that there s more a govern around the amount of leverage you d add per transaction jay horgen president and chief financial officer thanks rob let me start here i appreciate the way you asked the question taking a step back our longer term view on our balance sheet is to position it for strength make sure that we are able to execute on our growth opportunities over a cycle we have prudently managed our balance sheet over this time i d say look at the last five years we ve taken leverage down quite a bit that s led to increase in ratings as just a reflection of that leverage coming down but during the same time we ve been committed to returning capital to shareholders and we ve returned 1 billion since the beginning of 2017 as far as capacity let me walk you through that we did just extend our evolve our new five year revolver in january extended our term loan as well so we are well positioned today with leverage in a good place and also enough capacity on a revolver nearly 1 billion on a revolver to execute on our new investment pipeline i think when you look at the capital model over time continuing to limit leverage that we think we can do that while also returning capital to shareholders and we have repurchased shares in each of the last eight quarters with 76 million being repurchased in this past quarter maybe i ll just address that a bit further we met pretty volatile markets in december so we did a bit less than we had initially expected to do in the fourth quarter really because of the extreme volatility in the last two to three weeks of the year and then looking ahead this year we expect to continue to repurchase we mentioned in the prepared remarks 100 million to 300 million in the first half of the year as we also saw we increased our dividend we increased our share authorization so that we could repurchase additional shares throughout the year we have ample capacity under that authorization so taken together we do think we re going to continue to reduce leverage continue to repurchase shares the most important use of our capital is new investment we think that continued tremendous opportunity for us over the long term especially in periods of volatility because after those periods that tends to be times when executing on new investments is most attractive to shareholders nathaniel dalton chief executive officer yeah the only thing i would add to that is i think the question ultimately becomes especially if you re going to do something larger the question becomes when do you have that highest degree of confidence in the opportunities ahead of you i think as jay said we re positioning ourselves to be able to take advantage to deploy capital operator thank you our next question comes from the line of michael carrier with bank of america merrill lynch please proceed with your question shawn bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey guys this is actually shawn on for mike thanks for taking my question given the more challenging industry trends and the increasing need for scale do you see opportunities to centralize more affiliate calls to create some synergy and scale benefits nathaniel dalton chief executive officer let me start with that we talked about on prior calls there are parts of asset management where sales are definitely advantaged and parts of it where it s not i think this is where it s important to understand the unique business model that amg has which is we are able to manage a diverse set of distinctive return streams at effectively enormous scale in this affiliate model that we have the place where we have been investing the place where we have been working with our affiliates is how can you effectively bring that significant scale of diverse distinct return streams to bear which plays into some macro trends as well we talked in our prepared remarks about the consolidation of buyer behavior and centralization so those are places we ve been investing some of that is what we ve been doing with global distribution some of it is things like we announced i think the nordea relationship today some of it is our ability to continue to do things like that which is through a single point of contact make it very efficient for large buyers or large intermediaries to understand all of the return streams our affiliates have and then make it really easy for them to get access the streams they want which could be a product or could be something new but get access to the things they want and then get them into their client portfolios in a way that is both better in terms of faster getting the return streams faster and into the client portfolio but also ultimately done in a way that s a higher margin for us and for them as we make it really efficient for them to both understand the return streams and understand the evolution as well then the final thing i ll say is there s a really good virtuous circle to this which is we learn a lot from these relationships as we ve been going through them which informs not just our product development but also informs our new investment activity as well those are places we re investing we think there s a tremendous opportunity and we re really just at the early stages of that operator thank you our next question comes from the line of chris shutler with william blair please proceed with your question chris shutler william blair analyst hey guys good morning one new investments i know you ve missed out on some deals because of just being prudent around valuation given the scarcity of strong growing asset management firms i m curious to know how you are thinking about valuation in this environment more broadly why are you convinced this business model is still the right one and are you contemplating any kind of changes or moves into adjacencies nathaniel dalton chief executive officer let me start first we think there remains a very significant opportunity with the fundamental approach we have which is how do you partner with these outstanding manufacturing businesses that opportunity is we think still there we also think there s an opportunity to be a much better partner to these firms this goes to some of the kinds of things i was talking about in the prior question which is we think we ve been building capabilities which make us a better partner to those kinds of firms so we think that opportunity is really significant you re right we ve been disciplined but it s not just around pricing we ve been disciplined around a lot of different dimensions we ve been disciplined about the quality of the organizations i think we talked about in an earlier call about what we mean by high quality firms and what are the kinds of firms we think are going to succeed in this environment we ve been disciplined about quality we ve been disciplined about alignment making sure that we really get the long term alignment in a way that can ultimately be multi generational with the management team which we think is important for our model which has a permanent component we talked about so we ve been disciplined about the quality of the firms about the alignment we get with them absolutely we ve been disciplined about pricing but i ll say that s really just been an issue in a subset of the opportunities set in front of us it is an issue in that subset but it s really just an issue in a subset of the opportunity in front of us we continue to look at ways we can extend what we do we think there s such a big opportunity just in collecting these affiliates that have these fantastic returns selecting those as part of amg on our platform and then helping them go into client portfolios more effectively we think that opportunity is a really significant and differentiated opportunity we don t think there is anybody else out there able to prosecute that same opportunity operator thank you our next question comes from the line of alex blostein with goldman sachs please proceed with your question alexander blostein goldman sachs analyst thanks as we re thinking about the baseline management fee eps for you guys obviously there are a lot of moving pieces given the painful end of the year and nice rebound here but it also sounds like you guys are making various corporate investments i heard you were kind of 10 to 20 something performance fees but maybe help us with the baseline management fee run rate jay horgen president and chief financial officer so alex jay i ll make a couple of comments here the first just to put the framing out there we give guidance in a number of areas first this is helping you estimate the run rate aum and ebitda second is just the framework for modeling future growth the third is performance fees on the first run rate aum and ebitda which is directly to your question we started the year with 736 billion in aum our january markets are up and we ve had good flows as well in the retail channel a reversal from the fourth quarter so when you take that together our market blend is up 4 maybe a little over at this point so that gives you a sense for where aum is then as i mentioned in my prepared remarks we re in a range take the midpoint of that range 11 5 of ebtida to average aum and you can get close to what we think is a reasonable ebitda run rate for the first quarter another way to look at it is we gave you what our ebitda would have been before one time items in the fourth quarter of q21 we re off a little bit because the carryover of the fourth quarter being offset by the market and slows in the first quarter so far we re down a couple of percent so think 215 ish on a run rate basis that s another way to get to the same number obviously we go through all the other items to help you translate ebitda down to eps and the guidance as it relates to the framework for modeling future growth i think we see consensus in the street developing a good framework to track that as you know here we ve historically guided people 2 per quarter but that s really up to you i think most everyone knows how to track that then on the third item we talked about performance fees giving you guidance that in the first quarter in that range of ebitda to average aum we do expect 0 10 to 0 20 so at that 11 5 call a midpoint of 0 15 for the first quarter second and third quarter we typically don t have a lot of contracts to crystallize so a step down in those quarters so for the full year as you heard me say we expect a range of 0 75 to 1 75 i ll just comment that again given the uplift in markets new calendar year we ve really improved on our high watermark from last year s performance so we feel pretty good about that performance fee opportunity operator our next question comes from the line of brian bedell with deutsche bank please proceed with your question brian bedell deutsche bank analyst thanks very much jay or nate if you could go a little bit deeper into some of the alternative outflows in the fourth quarter i think you mentioned the delayed funding pipelines if those are actually turning around now in 1q then just on the one time in the fourth quarter if you could parse out the mass general versus the other one time item that you guys took for amg expenses as you think about expenses going forward on the global distribution effort does it make sense to invest more in that given you think you can leverage the good performance across a lot of your strategies going forward nathaniel dalton chief executive officer i ll start we ll try to do that one question in reverse order let me start with the spending point we talked about this a little in our prepared remarks and how we invest in the business if you look back we were pretty decisive in the fourth quarter in terms of we talked about this on earlier calls we ve been looking at this for the last couple quarters which is how do we make sure we re allocating our resources to the right things so we ve reduced spend and we ve clearly reduced resources allocated to product packages all those kinds of things some by us some by affiliates at the same time we ve been investing and increasing spend on the product development side this volatility creates opportunity to build out accelerate product development then as you said a place we have been investing both people and operational build is how do we make sure we get these return streams into the appropriate client portfolios some of that is specifically what we would have referred to as global distribution i think we talked about last quarter for example opening japan where we think there s a very large opportunity very early innings and we continue to see good traction some of our affiliates pantheon aqr have already opened up alongside that some of it is also building against what i ll call kind of channel partnerships or strategic relationships and some of the more complicated mandates we ve talked about on earlier calls is building those resources so that we can get affiliate return streams efficiently into people s portfolio we re absolutely doing that on that part of the question jay horgen president and chief financial officer i just wanted to add on the expenses as you know a large majority of our affiliates are under revenue share but where we do have exposure to expenses at amg and certain equity method affiliates we and they had reduced expenses pretty decisively in the fourth quarter gave rise to about 10 million of one time item sin the fourth quarter we will experience that savings in 19 if we look at where we re exposed to expenses again at amg and at certain of our affiliates we re going to take expenses down 2 to 3 year over year that s already in place the other one time expenses just to keep on that theme obviously mgh the total of mgh and those one time expense management actions has brought our ebitda from 191 to 221 we had a couple of other one time items of course the tax benefits and recovery from ivory as well as the revaluation of systematica those were the four one time items in the quarter if you re tracking that they all go through different financial statement line items so i m happy to follow up with you if you d like on that i think that s on expenses on alternative flows that was us tracking back in reverse order through your question the bridge flows for a moment you did hear me say in the prepared remarks that we did see some pretty significant seasonality which was exacerbated by the december volatility when we took a look at the data we do have pretty good visibility into the institutional book as well as retail seasonality so the institutional the expiration the multi year locks and single year locks and we had about 3 billion to 4 billion of seasonality there with another 4 billion to 5 billion in retail that gets you to that 7 billion to 9 billion number that i mentioned on the call the other factor which is a little harder to assess but i think there s a real number of the risk aversion which was causing lower sales given the extreme markets impacted our flows in that 1 billion to 2 billion number that level so when you take all that away there was still some softness in our flows and that really was alternatives in retail liquid alternatives seasonality and risk aversion exacerbated when we look more broadly over the course of the year we look at first quarter and say in retail we ve got positive flows for january improving performance in us equities a solid illiquid capital raising activity the trends for us remain intact volatility is good for active management and we do broadly speaking have a lot of good performing product across the diverse business we have when you add on to it ample capacity new products starting to gain traction like the systematic fixed income business nate mentioned together with our distribution efforts our evolving partnership with nordea we do think we ll be able to take these distinctive products into new channels new regions new partnerships pulling all that together our long term growth outlook for this year we do expect to return by the end of 2019 to something like 2 organic growth nathaniel dalton chief executive officer the only thing i would add to that is there are a couple of underlying dynamics and jay touched on one which is this balance between the development of products that we believe is distinctive and has good opportunity with the evolution of the book there s a roll off in the book of product that we think is more commoditized or susceptible to being commoditized you did see that over a period of time in some of our us equities in the institutional space as an example some of it is that evolution if you look at the mix of our products we re feeling good about the distinctive nature of an increasing percentage of those products the other dynamic i ll mention is the pullback in the fourth quarter and some of the volatility combined we have a number of products that are fantastic products with a very strong long term track record that have been closed and are reopening and making progress where they re starting to sort out how they re going to put some of the capacity from the fact they ve been closed but also from the standpoint with all this volatility they re seeing real opportunities those are dynamics that i ve put together these are longer term trends those extend beyond this year operator our next question comes from the line of dan fannon with jefferies dan fannon jefferies managing director i first want to clarify positive flows in january versus i think breakeven just clarify that on the retail or maybe that was all in in terms of institutional activity just curious as we see the retail data is retail within the liquid alternatives acting different than the institutional client base or are you seeing broadly institutional demand changing for some of the alternative strategies particularly at aqr jay horgen president and chief financial officer i ll clarify we did see about 100 million positive in the publicly visible clearly that was a significant reversal from december i think nate will pick up on the alternative point here and how it s acting in institutional when you look at the retail flows publicly visible this quarter that s not all of retail dan we do have some advisory and some non reporting retail that s harder for us to see given that it s early february but just commenting on what trends we re seeing in the public that are visible clearly the value managers both the us and global have seen a pretty strong reversal in both investment performance and flows we ve had good flows in us equities one of the themes emerging is where we ve had pretty significant outflows for a significant number of years here in us equities we ve seen really good things in the decreasing of outflows names like yacktman frontier river road have top quartile performance over the long term and we ve seen our us equity kind of three year numbers in aggregate for the first time go above 50 that s probably three or four years since that happened we re very positive about that on global equities we have also seen really good performance especially if the global and international mandates as well as the regional products we ve been plagued a little bit by em performance it s been a tough go for active in em still have great affiliates positioned well in em and some of those affiliates are opening products back up when you look into the data you re seeing international really being driven by that outstanding performance those themes really are emerging here in 2019 and as it relates to liquid alternatives and institutional nathaniel dalton chief executive officer i think 2018 was an extraordinary year in terms of the breadth of the negative returns across asset classes it was sort of historic that was an extraordinary year they underlying theses around why people are trying to get these alternative return streams into their portfolios they all remain intact i think you even see we talked about this in our prepared remarks even with that extraordinary breadth of negative returns across asset classes it really did serve a diversifying effect we look at the decision making in the institutional channel around alternatives and we continue to see very strong sales activity across a wide range of products both liquid and illiquid but certainly in liquid it s not a challenge of that pipeline and sales and opportunities to develop new products and all the rest so that all remains intact i will say there s one other point which is in the retail channel part of what happened was really just the combination of the performance plus the seasonality as people went through whether it was selling ahead of distributions that was part of what we experienced as well even in the institutional channel there was seasonality in institution we think the underlying trends are intact we think there s good activity pipeline it s not acting the same as retail we think those underlying the trends will continue all that said it s ultimately the return streams have to be distinctive and perform jay horgen president and chief financial officer one last thing i didn t want to leave these underlying trends without also mentioning the pe fundraising and illiquid we had a solid quarter a solid year we look forward and we see continued growth in illiquid both the new products and partnerships with large pools of capital you see this as an enduring growth opportunity for us as kind of the other major trend this year nathaniel dalton chief executive officer and a place where there s really good product development going on operator thank you our next question comes from the line of robert lee with kbw please proceed with your question robert lee kbw managing director thanks for taking my follow up if we think of the flows from the quarter kind of characterize that in terms of its ebitda impact if organically it was maybe just on the asset basis just under 2 would the ebitda impact be kind of similar or is there some mix issue that would make it greater or lower if we think jay kind of thinking that can get back to the 2 organic growth by the end of 19 given how you re looking at the mix going forward from what you can see would that be indicative of the ebitda contribution jay horgen president and chief financial officer let s take the ebitda contribution first the asset weighted ebitda contribution is a little hard to see in the underlying data because performance fees had such an impact on our results in the fourth quarter one of the things you can see as i mentioned if you kind of track ebitda from third to fourth to first quarter i mentioned the 221 for one time items in the fourth quarter going to something that looks like 215 that s just a couple of percent down the way you can also see that s tracking that was consistent with your inference that s tracking to when you look at average ebitda to average aum it s actually going up what that suggests it the assets that were lost had an average weighting that was consistent with our overall business and the mix shift for us is actually going back the other way after several quarters rather than going the reverse direction so i would say that i think that s partly because of where we re growing and it s also partly based upon the ownership mix of our business operator thank you ladies and gentlemen that concludes our time for questions i ll turn the floor back to mr dalton for any final comments nathaniel dalton chief executive officer thank you all again for joining us this morning as you heard we are confident in our prospects for significant long term growth

there s a notable lack of drivers for markets on monday also due to asian holidays investors may look to corporate earnings results which have so far been a mixed bag for direction as to u s equities we have been bearish on the for quite some time but have recently turned less assertive the fed s tightening pace was the one single headwind that we consistently focused on for stock trend predictions after historic central bank accommodation resulted in the longest bull market on record we did say that should the tightening risk be removed it would turn into a tailwind last week s and last month s market performance confirmed this thesis however we do still think that the market has overstated the fed s dovish tilt and this begs for a meaningful downward correction in the short term furthermore we are also concerned that the market is misinterpreting the fed s and particularly chair jerome powell s statements altogether powell repeatedly said that the fed is markedly data dependent and since there is a lack of available data due to the partial government shutdown the fed cannot adequately fine tune its policy path at present we would argue that this doesn t represent a policy shift as the market keeps claiming it rather marks a pause on policy decisions to clarify we don t know what the data will show when it becomes available and it may very well support what the market already thinks even if prematurely and therefore erroneously in our opinion on the other hand the market might be shocked right back to the brink of a bear market should it learn that it priced in a dovish turn that never occurred not only would it then return to the pre christmas levels but it would price in yet more rate hikes falling squarely into a full on bear market overall u s shares are up in the short term and down in the medium term the medium term would reverse if it posts an ascending series of peak and trough prices till then we will maintain our bearish stance up ahead

cape town veteran journalist and long time zimbabwe observer barry wood reports on the case for and against the global community bailing out president emmerson mnangagwa and his long ruling zanu pf party besides several corrupt top government officials and ubiquitous implacable gatekeepers only two sectors are doing well or thriving they are the cellphone sector or more particularly those providing cash and credit services on them and those servicing the agricultural sector for the latter solving the foreign exchange problem would flush out the entire system and metaphorically get more irrigation pivots spurting again to coax wide swathes of green shoot businesses from the parched but highly fertile soil for the former it s a crisis induced blessing the end of which will restore a far wider range of lucrative it options the question is would a simple bail out encourage mnangagwa s heavy hand or restore stability to enable him to leverage the assistance and introduce critically needed reform it all boils down to whether investors think he and his lieutenants are a good bet or not but it doesn t free anyone from the catch 22 dilemma chris bateman by barry wood harare zimbabwe joy has turned to despair in zimbabwe the optimism that greeted the coup that ousted tyrant robert mugabe in november 2017 vanished this january amid army bullets and beatings against citizens protesting a doubling of fuel prices zimbabweans had dared to hope that the coup plotters who were mugabe loyalists for three decades had broken with his repressive ways that they favoured greater democracy and a free economy piyano simba is typical of the despair a 30 year old with a wife and two children he has a certificate in business management unable to find work in his field piyano drives a cab in harare and has given up on the government in 2018 there was tentative progress and many outsiders concluded last july s elections were free and fair in september a respected economist and professor mthuli ncube was brought in to run the finance ministry he promised to bring order to government finance and introduce a proper currency as zimbabwe has been using the us dollar and a surrogate called bond notes there s an economic truism that bad money drives out good and that s happening in zimbabwe the collapse of the bond note links directly to the fuel price rise and protests the government issued the bond dollars a few years back to alleviate a cash shortage it was introduced at 1 1 with the us dollar but it gradually lost value at the moment the bond has crashed to four to the us not surprisingly people use bonds to buy goods holding on to their more valuable greenbacks as citizens of neighbouring countries drove to zimbabwe to buy fuel on the cheap exchanging their hard currency for bonds fuel queues proliferated sometimes stretching on for kilometres on january 14th the government doubled the fuel price both to boost government revenue and eliminate queues already impoverished zimbabweans were shocked and poured into the streets in protest the army and police response with internet access cut was ferocious zimbabweans have been suffering for years at least half the population is without jobs those who do work earn on average 250 per month the best and brightest young people have emigrated a rail system that was once the pride of africa barely functions so essential imports must come by truck corruption is pervasive extending to the highest levels of government and yet zimbabwe is rich with diamonds gold and platinum with good agricultural land and magnificent tourist attractions western governments and potential investors are conflicted over how to deal with the repressive government of president emmerson mnangagwa despite violence and corruption should tightly conditioned financial aid be extended to his fragile administration or should the american stance of denying assistance until human rights abuses end continue to be the norm critically the international monetary fund and world bank do not lend because of us opposition steve morland who runs a fertiliser company in harare favours western engagement as he sees progress in the agricultural sector farm output is increasing and morland says people s lives will improve if the monetary mess is fixed solve the foreign exchange problem and you ve solved zimbabwe he says for morland and other importers the shortage of cash and particularly foreign exchange is a huge problem ncube the finance minister wants to unify the chaotic multiple currency system but monetary experts insist that can t easily be done without outside help as zimbabwe is broke in the meantime citizens rich and poor overcome the cash shortage by using their cell phones expatriate zimbabwean strive masiyiwa s econet company handles a huge chunk of daily transactions cash or credit is deposited to the subscriber s account and then used for purchases all over the country without econet say economists zimbabwe would grind to a halt in sum zimbabwe is stuck with a government showing no signs of giving the opposition a say in decision making and an economy that is barely ticking over zimbabweans are angry despondent and pessimistic about the future freelance journalist barry d wood has been reporting from zimbabwe for three decades first for the financial mail then nbc news and

venezuela trying to sell gold to stay afloat venezuela is reaching for its last card as the deck collapses on president nicolas maduro s failed regime the country is selling its gold in order to provide liquidity for imports of basic goods you know your regime s days are numbered when you start eyeing your bullion indeed gold s status as store of value as money the only currency available when yours is worthless has come into play with respect to the crisis that has been unfolding in venezuela over the last couple of years and appears to be reaching its peak the mysterious plane on tuesday a venezuelan politician tweeted that a russian boeing 777 had landed in caracas intending to transport 20 tons of gold stored in the central bank while jose guerra couldn t provide any evidence of the bullion haul worth about 840 million or 20 of its central bank reserves bloomberg confirmed it separately a person with direct knowledge of the matter told bloomberg news that 20 tons of gold have been set aside in the central bank for loading the news outlet reported on friday however the maduro regime canceled the shipment where could the gold have been going we don t know but we can make an educated guess based on venezuela s recent gold transactions swiss trade data venezuela used to sell gold to switzerland reveals that venezuela exported almost 100 of 2 billion in gold exports over the last two years to turkey and the united arab emirates 1 1 billion to uae and 901 million to turkey in november the country was reportedly planning to sell 15 tonnes to the uae in return for cash euros russia has also received venezuelan gold we also know that one of the private jets spotted in caracas this week belonged to ciner a turkish mining company turkish president erdogan is one of maduro s only friends these days as venezuela slips further into chaos with reports of extreme hyperinflation and mass unemployment according to australia s news com au a roll of toilet paper worth a 0 55 costs 2 600 000 bolivars the government is so desperate for cash it can t even afford to print its own currency venezuela s trade in gold with turkey is raising suspicions the bullion is ending up in iran in violation of us sanctions ankara has been warned to stop sanctions busting maduro s earlier failed attempt to take venezuela s gold out of the uk is further evidence that the russian plane story is true the bank of england reportedly blocked him from taking us 1 2 billion out from venezuela s 8 4 billion total gold reserves estimated by the world gold council the embattled venezuelan president s hold on power is looking very tenuous the us uk and several european countries have publicly supported national assembly leader juan guaido as interim president on monday the united states slapped sanctions on venezuela s state owned oil company pdvsa which the us believes to be a vehicle for embezzlement the oil sanctions are expected to affect about 7 billion in assets immediately and another 11 billion this year cnn said us purchases of venezuelan oil will be blocked the russian connection so where was the russian plane planning to go with 20 tons of gold a little research shows that maduro needs financial support from russia and is using the only thing he has left as collateral for borrowing more bullion the kremlin loaned the country about 3 billion in 2017 but compared to venezuela s 120 billion debt it s a drop in the bucket the new york times reports russia lent venezuela 10 billion from 2013 17 for a price oil and influence last year the biggest oil company in the world state owned rosneft bought nearly half of citgo pdvsa s refining subsidiary in the united states the purchase was collateral for a 1 5b loan the kremlin made to pdvsa the citgo deal was part of a strategy by russia to use rosneft to achieve foreign policy objectives rosneft s investments have also been focused on cuba china egypt and vietnam and it has been seeking deals around the eastern mediterranean and africa areas where it contends with american interests using its oil company as a geopolitical tool has given russia more running room at a time when western sanctions weigh heavily on its economy the new york times for venezuela the loans avoided a debt default while helping rosneft to lessen the pain of us and european sanctions against the company in fact russia has become venezuela s new banker states new york times replacing china which has given up making loans pdvsa used the russian money to keep producing oil also both russia and china use oil as currency they both accept payment of venezuelan oil in exchange for debt repayments good for venezuela since it avoids having to dip into foreign exchange reserves knowing all this the russian plane parked on the tarmac in caracas waiting for 20 tons of gold begins to make more sense the monroe doctrine it does seem strange though that russia is so flagrantly meddling in venezuela a country clearly within the us zone of influence in the 1800 s the united states under president james monroe invoked the monroe doctrine which stated that any effort by european nations to control any independent state in north or south america would be viewed as an unfriendly disposition towards the united states the intent of the monroe doctrine was to free the newly independent colonies of latin america from mostly spain and portugal so that the states could exert its influence undisturbed since then the monroe doctrine has at times been invoked when us interests in its own backyard were threatened sometimes going as far as regime change a recent book by foreign affairs contributor lindsey o rourke notes that the us attempted 18 overthrows of latin american governments during the cold war 10 of which saw us forces assume power the states was accused of instigating a coup in venezuela an allegation the us denies and trying to assassinate maduro s predecessor hugo chavez as for current us interests in venezuela we know that president trump considered invading venezuela in 2017 but was talked out of it by his national security advisor and others in his cabinet we also know that us geopolitical interests have been threatened recently by russia which in december landed two nuclear capable blackjack bombers this was a way for russia to shore up support for a key ally and its top oil supplier but it was also a means of provoking the us a violation of the 200 year old monroe doctrine the kremlin is trying to take advantage of a weak regime by cozying up to maduro offering financial aid and military support thereby gaining influence in the region the orinoco the lingering question though is why does the united states care so much about venezuela the media reports this week are full of quotes from us officials saying they want to free the suffering venezuelan people from a corrupt regime we ve heard this from the us many times before at ahead of the herd we re a little more cynical and we always follow the money a little digging reveals some interesting truths at the end of december oilprice com reported a confrontation between the venezuelan navy and two norwegian ships conducting seismic work in the waters off guyana next door to venezuela the us jumped to guyana s defense saying the venezuelan navy was being aggressive why should they care because of what lies under the surface as oilprice com reports the move comes as exxonmobil and its partner hess corp are spending heavily to develop a string of oil discoveries off the coast of guyana the discoveries encompass some 5 billion barrels of oil reserves and offshore guyana has quickly jumped to the top of the priority list for exxonmobil as such guyana a very small and poor country on the northern coast of south america is home to one of the most active and attractive offshore plays in the world in early 2018 exxon unveiled a spending plan that would allow the company to significantly increase oil production by 2025 after years of stagnating output exxon s sterling reputation among shareholders has taken a hit in recent years as it has struggled to grow and some of its peers have caught up to the supermajor in fact many analysts now see some of exxon s rivals as a much more compelling investment exxon s strategy to boost profits and expand production hinges on two key upstream targets the first the permian basin comes as no surprise because every other oil company seems to be betting their fortunes on texas shale the second however is offshore guyana the us government protecting american oil companies you don t say if the states can help bring a pro american government to power in venezuela it will assist big oil companies in tapping into the largest oil reserves in the world we find it especially interesting that exxon is heading to offshore guyana for its next oil score us shale oil is heading for a fall in the next few years due to the high depletion rate of shale wells producers have to pump more oil faster just to keep up a phenomenon known as the red queen syndrome putting a pro western government in power would also help to develop the orinoco belt a heavy and extra heavy oilsands region the size of costa rica venezuela has 298 billion barrels of proven oil reserves the largest in the world most are in the orinoco not only is there a lot of oil it s also easier and cheaper to produce than canadian oilsands because it doesn t contain bitumen the oily sludge that is hard to process but the oil is still expensive to extract like alberta it has to be open pit mined or pumped to surface using horizontal directional drilling in the 1990s chavez brought in foreign companies for their technologies but in 2006 07 he took control of the industry despite big investments from exxonmobil chevron conocophillips and bp he gave pdvsa 60 of the four best projects in the orinoco enforcing the order by sending troops exxon and conoco walked away and sued eventually getting compensated while the others stayed content to hang onto 40 stakes the financial times reports the flight of foreign oil companies and technology along with the chavez government s failure to appreciate the level of capital expenditures required meant that orinoco s output declined according to forbes venezuelan oil production has slumped to 1 5 million barrels a day just over half of what is was before 2006 conclusion what do you do when your country is falling apart if you re venezuelan president maduro you find bullion to sell or use as a bargaining chip this is a sad state of affairs especially for the people who must be enduring a monetary hardship the equal of weimar germany but on the other hand it s a solid vindication of gold you don t see maduro trying to sell bitcoin to pay the bills gold is often criticized by wall street as being kind of a useless investment institutional investors tend to prefer investments that are thought to contain the potential for growth growth sprouts an investment has to produce a growing revenue stream if it doesn t grow it doesn t compound so gold is rejected as an investment because it doesn t produce sprouts meaning the steady income and systematic growth so sought after by institutional investors just isn t there but that s not why we the people should own gold gold is insurance gold gives all of us something that fiat paper money or any other financial innovation cannot deliver in times of the turmoil escaping nazi germany or buying food medicine water or even toilet paper in a crisis like venezuela is going through what do you do when your paper money is worthless you sell barter and trade your gold just like maduro by richard rick mills www aheadoftheherd com rick

briefing highlights january and stocks markets loonie at a glance what to expect in jobs report what to watch for from twitter what else to watch for this week bill gross retiring after more than 40 years from today s globe and mail january and stocks you ve got to remember that december was brutal thus magnifying the impact of the january stock market rally still it was a powerful rally the best in years which makes bank of montreal s recent research notable reading though bmo suggests investors focus on fundamentals rather than history first as bmo senior economist robert kavcic noted the s p 500 gained 7 9 per cent last month marking the best january in more than three decades the s p tsx composite index fared even better climbing 8 5 per cent for the strongest month in 10 years helping to push markets were low liquidity program driven selling and on the toronto market the narrower gap between canadian and global oil prices and a surge in pot stocks fundamentally with markets sensing that we ve been nearing a potential cyclical tipping point a decisively dovish shift by the federal reserve capped off the month stoking expectations that this already long expansion can run further mr kavcic said he was referring to last week s signal from the u s central bank that it plans to ease off in its rate hiking cycle going slower and easier than had been expected and possibly not disrupting the economic expansion since the dark days of the financial crisis so back to january which equity market lore suggests can set the pace for the year historically since 1960 the january direction has successfully predicted the rest of year direction 64 per cent of the time mr kavcic said stop right there while that looks solid on the surface we wouldn t boast about the statistical significance and there have been a few notorious misses think 1987 but mr kavcic also looked at januarys marked by a stock surge of at least 5 per cent like last month in those cases there have been 11 of them the s p 500 has followed through with gains through the rest of the year 82 per cent of the time with a solid average gain of 12 per cent and an impressive six of those years coming in around 20 per cent he said pointing out though that this didn t hold true for january 2018 at any rate there s a hint of truth to the january effect lore especially when the first month is very strong but given the small sample we d prefer to focus on the fundamentals such as how fed policy evolves this year remember too that this will be an uncertain year as global economic growth slows and at this point at least with american and chinese trade warriors still going at it read more markets at a glance read more what to watch for this week the next few trading days shouldn t be as eventful as

inc and twitter inc which should be interesting user growth or increase in profits seems to be the tightrope that social media companies need to navigate these days said cmc markets chief analyst michael hewson noting twitter s profit rebound in its last report this more than offset a decline in monthly users from 335 million to 326 million though most of this appears to have come about as a result of a housekeeping exercise as twitter purged a host of fake and abusive accounts he added this is likely to continue to act as a drag on the company s user growth and while some would suggest that a slowdown in user growth is a bad thing surely it s more important to focus on what generates a return rather than on headline numbers friday statistics canada releases its january jobs report though you ve got to remember that these monthly readings can be volatile which is why economists expect to see anywhere from a loss of 5 000 jobs to a rise of 15 000 last month with unemployment holding at 5 6 per cent or inching up to 5 7 we re pencilling in a modest gain of 6 000 jobs with further declines seen in alberta partially offsetting growth in other areas of the country said cibc world markets senior economist royce mendes that slight gain won t be enough to keep the unemployment rate pinned down at the historical low we saw last month but should still see it rise only a tick

forbes billionaires list of the wealthy has become an annual ritual in the midst of excruciating poverty in nigeria the list is always received with mixed feelings resentment from the needy and happiness from those considered rich enough to make the annual lists bamidele famoofo reports that what is more important to an average nigerian is how impactful these billionaires riches have been in their lives while the rich in dollars celebrate their emergence on the forbes billionaires list published on an annual basis what are the ways these rich men have been able to affect our lives with their fabulous wealth obviously this is the question in the minds of the ordinary nigerians who can barely meet their daily needs as the saying goes in some parts of the country a rich man who does not spend for his neighbour is indeed a poor man forbes for the sake of those who may wonder what forbes list is all about it is basically a highly respected annual ranking by documented net worth of

these lists this ranking is an index of the wealthiest documented individuals excluding and ranking against those with wealth that is not able to be completely ascertained world in 2018 there was a record of 2 208 people on the list which included 259 newcomers mostly from china and the us there were 63 people under 40 and it had a record number of 256 women the average net worth of the list

the bank of england will have more than brexit on its mind when it meets next week as a slowdown in the global economy tests its plan to return to raising interest rates before too long governor mark carney and his fellow interest rate setters are expected to keep borrowing costs on hold at 0 75 percent on thursday with britain at risk of leaving the european union just 50 days later without a transition deal in place to ease the shock prime minister theresa may trying to placate lawmakers in her conservative party is pushing for concessions from eu leaders on a key part of the brexit deal that she agreed with them last year that is something the bloc has said it will not do on top of the uncertainty about the brexit stand off the loss of momentum in the world economy and in particular in the biggest eu countries is likely to exert a drag on britain s stumbling economy on wednesday the u s federal reserve signalled its three year run of raising rates might be ending and the european central bank has sounded more worried that the euro zone s recovery has run out of steam is the global slowdown just temporary we think so but it has lasted quite a long time maybe we are at the peak of the cycle george brown an economist with investec said perhaps that s the view that the boe takes although it s not our view the boe which bases its forecasts on the assumption of a smooth brexit will try to balance the drag on britain from a weaker global economic outlook with the potential boost from finance minister philip hammond s relaxation of his grip on public spending the boe s forecasts for britain s economic growth might therefore be little changed when it publishes its quarterly inflation report alongside its decision on rates on thursday but some economists say there is a chance of a higher inflation forecast that makes investors rethink their bets against a boe rate hike until the end of 2019 at the earliest although inflation has fallen to within a whisker of the boe s 2 0 percent target the wages of british workers are rising at their fastest pace in a decade surprising the boe and potentially pushing up prices a minority of economists think one member of the nine strong monetary policy committee will vote for a rate hike next week that plus the chance of the boe turning even more pessimistic about the inflationary speed limit of britain s low productivity economy would set the uk apart as a hawkish story in an increasingly dovish world hsbc economist elizabeth martins said it might come as a surprise to the market by the time the mpc announces its next policy decision on march 21 a few days before the scheduled brexit date of march 29 the picture could look very different by then it should be clearer if the united states and china have avoided the prospect of a trade war and more importantly for the boe whether britain will avoid a damaging no deal brexit at least in the immediate future the boe has warned that a worst case brexit scenario could hurt britain s economy more than the global financial crisis paul dales an economist with capital economics said a deal on brexit could lead to the unusual situation of the boe raising interest rates at a time when the u s fed is cutting them it doesn t happen often but nor does brexit he said yes the global economy seems to be turning but the boe has room for catch up source reuters writing by william schomberg editing by hugh lawson
china s grand plan for expanding its influence has multiple strategic layers that involve sovereignty claims preserving its territorial integrity expanding its economy and testing the united states authors patrick mendis and joey wang explore the various facets this plan in a two part series that examines the scope of possibilities available to xi jinping this is the second part of the series the enablers of national rejuvenation the key enabler that has allowed beijing to protect its sovereign claims and project its power has been china s explosive economic growth as it cools however major programs such as the bri will be critical to any future projection of power as envisioned the purpose of bri is to promote regional economic cooperation strengthen exchanges and mutual learning between different civilizations and promote world peace and development behind this heady mixture of material economic and cultural aspirations however there are other hidden motivations not likely to be mentioned in official chinese literature first china also wants to decrease the dependence on its domestic infrastructure investment and begin moving investments overseas to address the capacity overhang within china it should not come as an astonishment that the key instrument of this investment transfer comes with the chinese system of state capitalism which has further been solidified by president xi among the bri infrastructure development projects chinese companies accounted for 89 percent of the contractors according to a five year analysis of bri projects by the center for strategic and international studies in washington bri also parallels numerous regional economic and infrastructure development initiatives such as the bay of bengal initiative for multi sectoral technical and economic cooperation bimstec the ayeyarwady chao phraya mekong economic cooperation strategy acmecs and the regional comprehensive economic partnership rcep as the country with the deepest pockets a number of these member countries have found chinese capital too attractive to resist chairing the bimstec this year sri lanka for example now finds itself granting china a ninety nine year lease at the hambantota port as well as approximately fifteen thousand acres of land nearby for an industrial zone to help pay for part of the 1 1 billion it owes china laos and cambodia members of acmecs are so indebted to china that australia s former foreign minister gareth evans has purportedly opined that they have become wholly owned subsidiaries of china some countries have now learned from the sri lanka experience and have recognized that the costs far outweigh the benefits bangladesh for instance has declined chinese funding for the much needed the twenty kilometers long rail and road bridges over padma river and has instead opted to self generated funds thailand under acmecs is also working to create a regional infrastructure fund to reduce reliance on china and avoid what has generally been called china s debt trap diplomacy even outside the immediate domain of the bri china is using its wealth to isolate taiwan diplomatically in latin america china peeled away el salvador in august after peeling away the dominican republic in may 2018 with growing chinese influence in africa swaziland a tiny landlocked country remains the only african country to recognize taiwan after burkina faso established diplomatic relations with beijing in may 2018 china is also expanding its presence and engagement in the caribbean with capital investments and infrastructure financing which have played significantly to china s advantage given the caribbean s proximity to the hurricane belt in america s backyard the caribbean so called the third border of the united states has been neglected even after congress passed the u s caribbean strategic engagement act of 2016 the trump white house has shown little interest in engaging the caribbean basin many observers think that the region is too democratic and not poor enough to get on the american foreign policy agenda even though washington has long noticed the chinese inroads in america s third border region beijing has often hailed the chinese investments as win win however given that many of these countries both within and outside the bri are now indebted to china it is not clear whether the partnership is a win for both china and its counterpart or china actually wins twice since a it is generally well understood that the switching of allegiance is more monetary than ideological and b the recipient often ends up indebted to china without the means to repay the debt second china wants to internationalize the use of its currency along bri and with the new partners of africa latin america and the caribbean basin making the renminbi rmb a global currency in 2015 had been one of the highest economic priorities of beijing s grand plan china and some sixty five bri countries which account collectively for over 30 percent of global gdp 62 percent of the population and 75 percent of known energy reserves are increasingly using the rmb to facilitate trade and infrastructure projects pakistan for one has switched from the dollar to the rmb for bilateral trade with china after president donald trump publicly attacked pakistan on twitter for harboring terrorists the china pakistan economic corridor c pec to xinjiang as one of the massive projects under the bri can now depend upon a steady stream of chinese capital pakistan can now also minimize the risk of washington s threats such as cutting off economic assistance and military support use of the rmb would also help authoritarian regimes like iran north korea and sudan to undermine the american imposed financial sanctions on the violations of such norms as human rights child labor and human trafficking furthermore the success of bri if achieved would establish eurasia as the largest economic market in the world and the changing currency dynamics could initiate a shift in the world away from the dollar based financial system third china seeks to secure its energy resources through new pipelines in central asia russia and south and southeast asia s deep water ports beijing s leadership for some years has been concerned about its malacca dilemma as president hu jintao declared in 2003 that certain major powers may control the strait of malacca and china needed to adopt new strategies to mitigate the perceived vulnerability the strait of malacca is not only the main conduit connecting the indian ocean and the pacific ocean to china via the south china sea but also the shortest sea route between oil suppliers in the persian gulf and key markets in asia in 2016 sixteen million barrels of crude oil transited through the malacca strait each day of which 6 3 million barrels were destined for china in 2017 china surpassed the united states as the world s largest crude oil importer therefore the sustainability and security of energy supplies is a key input not only to china s domestic stability and economic growth but also to its military operations and concomitantly the very legitimacy of the cpc initiatives under the bri such as the c pec to xinjiang province the kyaukpyu pipeline in myanmar that runs to yunnan province and the ongoing discussions for the proposed kra canal in thailand are of vital interest to china because they would provide alternative routes for energy resources from the middle east directly to china that bypass the malacca strait the bri will also support the expansion of china s military bases across the bay of bengal indian ocean and the arabian sea global response led by washington as beijing s intentions become clear the continuing tensions have now revived the quadrilateral security dialogue with australia india japan and the united states each of these quad members has its own economic and geostrategic concerns over balancing china s expanding power and influence with a host of counter strategies president trump has for example signed into law the asia reassurance initiative act of 2018 a belated expression of america s commitment to the security and stability of the indo pacific region the u s senate has also passed the better utilization of investments leading to development build act of 2018 to reform and improve overseas private investment to help developing countries in ports and infrastructure it is also aimed at countering china s influence and assisting bri countries with alternatives to china s debt trap diplomacy viewed in the context of history china s rise has been nothing short of meteoric in the sixty plus years since u s secretary of state john foster dulles declared the three principles that 1 the united states would not recognize the people s republic of china 2 would not admit it to the un and 3 would not lift the trade embargo china has grown from a veritable economic backwater to one that is now projecting its economic and military power around the world china now seeks to create a new set of global norms while overturning the existing norms that beijing claims it had no role in creating that may be true but china should remember that those existing international norms have also played a critical role in raising china to where it is today war indications and warnings successive american and chinese leaders have come and gone but china s strategic objectives have remained much the same as they were in 1965 when the cia concluded inter alia that the goal of cpc for the foreseeable future would be to eject the west especially the us from asia and to diminish us and western influence throughout the world the cia further reported that beijing also aimed to increase the influence of communist china in asia as well as to increase the influence of communist china throughout the underdeveloped areas of the world

decisions about future monetary policy the central bank also removed reference to further gradual increases to the federal funds rate in its statement a signal aussie and kiwi traders took to mean that it may slow the pace of interest rate increases in 2019 the fed also left the benchmark overnight lending rate unchanged between a range of 2 25 percent and 2 5 percent at their january meeting this move was widely expected story continues commodity linked currency demand on us china trade optimism the aud usd and nzd usd hit their highs of the week as investors sought riskier currencies

today i discuss why elevated political uncertainty is not translating into higher financial market volatility and what the future might look like during january market based measures of volatility across foreign exchange interest rates and credit markets collapsed while estimates of political uncertainty are at record levels since 2011 12 market volatility has decoupled from estimates of global political uncertainty i e uncertainty about future governments actions why is this the case and is market volatility likely to recouple with political uncertainty in my view there are several reasons why market volatility has decoupled from political uncertainty first there is an abundance of political noise for example in the us where politicians pronouncements often do not have much to do with their future policy actions as lubos pastor and pietro veronesi both professors at the university of chicago argue the political signals coming from the trump administration are frequently imprecise and therefore difficult for investors to interpret however trump is a symptom not a cause of a much broader trend in my view the polarisation of societies and the spread of social media create opposing political meta narratives which is visible in the news coverage our allegiance to narrative leads us to dispute facts that challenge our confirmation bias and embrace other facts or even fake news that confirm our narrative recent estimates of political uncertainty in the us count the terms uncertainty and economic and policy terms such as fed congress and deficit in newspaper articles i believe that such measures tend to overestimate the uncertainty about future government actions compared with the period before the global financial crisis for example a washington post article describing the unsustainability of us public debt and the disagreement between the white house and the congress does not necessarily reflect higher uncertainty about future policy actions estimates of political uncertainty may drop when the trump era ends however i do not believe that such estimates will fall to levels seen before the global financial crisis in fact i would argue that sometimes we focus too much on politics and not enough on economics in analysing market volatility political uncertainty is only important for markets if it leads to policy actions that influence economic fundamentals and the behaviour of market participants only then would political uncertainty influence risk premiums and market volatility for example in 2016 many focused on analysing the implications of brexit and trump s victory both events triggered a sharp rise in market volatility but it did not last long why was this the case most economists including ourselves believed that economic growth would take a dive following brexit and trump instead the global economy recovered sharply in h2 16 supported by loose monetary policy putting downward pressure on market volatility moreover the financial community sometimes focuses on the wrong political uncertainty for example volatility in the swedish krona rose ahead of the swedish elections in september despite the fact that most observers agreed that a new government would not lead to a significant change in economic policy markets stabilised a few days ahead of the elections and completely ignored the fact that sweden was without a government for four months as it did not influence economic policymaking instead sometimes we overlook the political uncertainty that receives less media attention but has significant economic and financial implications for example the confusion regarding the german government s car emission policy has created bottlenecks in the car sector with real economic and financial consequences i do not think the german car debacle received enough attention is current elevated political uncertainty likely to drive higher market volatility going forward i do not think so political uncertainty with respect to the us china trade war is possibly the most important risk this year as it has real economic and financial consequences this week top level talks between the us and china ended on a positive note and we believe the chances of a trade deal already in march has increased the brexit situation is as fluid as ever but we believe that tuesday s vote in the house of commons supports our case that a no deal brexit will be averted this week the fed delivered a very dovish message signalling that 1 inflation should surprise on the upside for it to hike rates again and 2 it will soon put an end to the balance sheet run off in recent years low monetary policy uncertainty offers one explanation why market volatility has been so low i believe that low monetary policy uncertainty will persist given the fed s signal this week finally we expect the world economy to pick up speed from q2 onwards which could lower the sensitivity of market volatility to political uncertainty even further download the full harr s view

during a panel at davos dell founder michael dell was asked about his opinion on the proposal of a 70 top marginal tax rate he replied name a country where that has worked ever co panelist erik brynjolfsson mit names the united states in between the 1930s and the 1960s when the average top rate was higher than 70 with peaks of 91 on january 4th alexandria ocasio cortez newly elected congresswoman and rising star of the democratic party proposed in an interview with 60 minutes to raise the tax rate to 70 on incomes above 10 million the tax she explained is meant to finance her plan for a green new deal an ambitious programme of investments in carbon free infrastructures and jobs across various sectors in order to decarbonise the economy by 2030 ocasio cortez argued that if taken in a historical perspective this is far from a radical idea under dwight eisenhower s presidency in the 1950s top marginal tax rates were as high as 91 coming from the 73 of 1920 and still as high as 70 in 1980 this proposal kick started a heated debate not only about the technical calculations of top marginal tax rates but also on the progressivity of tax systems and the role of different economic policy instruments in fighting inequality for the washington post jeff stein with the help of tax experts such as mark mazur tax policy center joel slemrod university of michigan and ernie tedeschi treasury department of obama s white house tries to assess the implications of this tax policy mazur calculates that it could raise 720 billion over the next decade affecting 0 05 of the us population around 16 000 households although the estimate is likely to be much smaller because of the changing behaviour of the millionaires paul krugman steps into the debate in a new york times op ed reframing ocasio cortez s proposal not as a radical socialist idea but as an economically sound proposal even moderate if viewed from a historical perspective krugman quotes the diamond saez 2011 calculation of the 73 optimal top marginal tax rate as well as the ideal rate found by romer romer 2011 which was higher than 80 he challenges the republican trickle down arguments for tax cuts as based on research by well nobody showing a non negative correlation between economic growth and top marginal tax rates but what would be the economic justification for high top marginal income rates krugman builds the argument on diminishing marginal utilities and competitive markets the former imply that an extra dollar of income is more useful to low income families than to richer ones if each agent is paid her marginal utility marginal top tax rates could even theoretically be up to 100 the obvious tradeoff is that this would totally eliminate any incentive to work more and hurt economic growth and innovation however in case of non perfectly competitive markets where market failures such as monopolies and rents are present the optimal marginal tax rate that maximises social benefits and aggregate welfare can be quite high john cochrane replies to krugman s arguments by pointing out that the 70 calculations are based on arbitrary assumptions and that mirrlees 1971 calculates an optimal rate of 0 starting from different assumptions cochrane writes that saez diamond calculations do not include federal and local state taxes and that the disincentive argument does not account for human capital decisions that individuals might take and like the decision to relocate it depends on the total tax bite not just the marginal tax bite how much will i earn after all taxes what lifestyle will i lead if i go to med school or just stay where i am clive crook on bloomberg highlights the technical difficulties of calculating optimal tax rates drawing attention to the fact that saez zucman 2011 estimate a range between 48 76 where the optimal tax rate might lie also crook argues that economically it is a very questionable proposal the risk is that the most successful entrepreneurs would emigrate which would have costs higher than a loss of tax revenue but what crook finds as the main problem with social welfare maximising policies is that by grounding arguments in diminishing marginal utilities they ignore questions of justice and liberty whether some of the rich might deserve to be rich because of the work they ve done the risks they ve taken or the ideas they ve come up with is irrelevant garrett watson at the tax foundation underlines the risk that innovation processes will be hampered by higher marginal tax rates quoting empirical evidence from a 2018 working paper by charles jones by contrast pasi kuoppamäki chief economist of danske bank a s s finland branch writes on the hill that nordic countries although each helped by having a smaller population have been able to make high taxation work well without harming innovation or incentives to work while providing comprehensive welfare policies on bloomberg noah smith also endorses the proposal as far from radical and economically well grounded and further the key issue in his view is to go beyond this plan and reform the corporate and capital gains tax systems enlarging the base of high earners and probably using wealth taxes tyler cowen michael strain and karl smith join in a debate with noah smith on the economics of ocasio cortez s plan for a top marginal tax rate they express several concerns about the effectiveness of such a plan in fighting inequality a plan that would foster tax avoidance schemes and hamper innovation processes karl smith points out what makes these systems redistributive is not punitive tax rates on the rich but broad based taxes that are used to fund a universal basic income for everyone on avoidance aparna mathur american enterprise institute explained that elasticities of high income individuals that have a much higher capacity to avoid taxes would result in a government revenue 27 8 lower than the calculations made in a static scenario she proposes alternative solutions such as an x tax as suggested by carroll and viard 2012 that would distort incentives less or a carbon tax that also would also entail redistributive mechanisms a point elaborated upon in a recent bruegel blueprint written by grégory claeys gustav fredriksson and georg zachmann the bloomberg editorial board argued that ocasio cortez s idea is unwise but worth discussing since the revenue needs of the government will rise in the future both for social security spending and for tackling climate change they suggest to focus on closing loopholes and broadening the tax base before raising the rates emmanuel saez and gabriel zucman of the university of california and berkeley address these concerns in an op ed for the new york times they reply to the objections showing that high top marginal tax rates are not correlated with slower economic growth not only in the united states but also in japan between 1950 and 1982 their main point though is of a political nature while in the us incomes in the lower half of the distribution have stagnated for 30 years the top 0 1 saw an increase of 300 and the 0 001 of 600 in their view proposals like ocasio cortez s have more to do with preserving a japan style liberal democracy rather than paving the way for authoritarian reactions that result from years of negative income growth rates for a large part of the population if the concentration of incomes at the top coincides with concentration of power higher tax rates are meant to shelter society from the dangers of plutocracy more than to finance investment plans or the welfare state this op ed raised many reactions both from the left and from the right greg mankiw criticised the political argument by commenting that most of the people that are earning high incomes earned their wealth honestly and have less political influence than commonly thought chris dillow from a marxist perspective argues that the excessive political influence of the rich cannot be solved by a socialist democrat state intervention which would be insufficient to mitigate the failures of capitalism the debate was pushed two days later by the proposal of a tax reform by the democratic presidential candidate elizabeth warren this plan would introduce a wealth tax on the ultra rich a novel element in the history of us tax system the proposal is based on an analysis by saez and zucman a 2 tax on the wealth that exceeds 50 millions and an additional surplus tax of 1 on households with a net worth of more than 1 billion these taxes would raise according to their calculations 2 75 trillion for a 10 year timespan 1 0 of gdp per year affecting 75 000 households a group smaller than the 0 1 according to saez and zucman the ultra rich tax would be able to raise 212 billion for 2019 they present an estimate by piketty saez and zucman 2018 that the tax burden on the wealth of the richest 0 1 households including local state and federal taxes would be 3 2 for 2019 lower than the burden on the 99 estimated at 7 2 they claim that the ultra rich tax would raise the burden on the 0 1 to 4 3 the revenue generated senator warren explains in an interview could be funneled into childcare and healthcare proposals and to reduce student debt yet the main objective in the senator s words is to help to level the power dynamics in washington reducing the amount of political influence that the economic elite can achieve it s about making democracy work better and it s about making the economy work better when you ask me about the centerpiece it actually starts with an anti corruption bill that tries to reduce the influence of money in washington warren s proposal was defended by noted tax experts and by paul krugman in the new york times arguing that although radical it would raise the average tax rates on the richest 0 1 to 48 up from 36 he added that it would be feasible looking at denmark and sweden where higher taxes did not lead to higher fiscal evasion if adequately enforced on bloomberg while noah smith favoured a wealth tax meant to reduce income inequality as a better plan than many of the alternatives harvard s law professor noah feldman expressed concerns as to the constitutionality of such a tax shared by another candidate for the 2020 elections michael bloomberg as in the case of the ocasio cortez proposal many commentators put forward the argument that these type of taxes would hamper innovation and entrepreneurship european trends this chart from piketty s capital in the 21st century depicts a decreasing trend in top marginal tax rates from a historical perspective in a comparison between france germany the uk and the us the share of national income for the top 1 has been on the rise in many european countries the late anthony atkinson proposed a 65 top tax rate for the uk in inequality what can be done 2015 and also piketty called for a rethinking of top marginal income rates in europe of course as mentioned by grace blakeley the situation on the european side is much more complex and would require capital controls to be effective however if europe is to accept the preoccupations for democracy expressed by saez and zucman it should have a debate on high income taxation

abidjan when kwame nkrumah under whose leadership ghana became the first african country to claim independence in 1957 was overthrown by a military coup in 1966 few of his fellow citizens shed a tear for his regime but one aspect of his legacy remains relevant to this day and merits careful consideration nkrumah was a visionary and charismatic leader whose focus was on modernising ghana and on campaigning for africa s political unity his most brilliant idea was to integrate the continent and create the united states of africa but he favored the development of costly capital intensive projects which led to unsustainable foreign debt and deficits while creating few employment opportunities economic contraction led to widespread unrest and to a loss of credibility for the idea of african integration and to fallout with his famous economic adviser the future nobel laureate w arthur lewis
gordon campbell on listening to ocasio cortez about tax gordon campbell on why we should be listening to ocasio cortez about tax first published on werewolf tax is always an ideological hot button those key equations tax bad and tax cuts good have been hammered into our brains over the past three decades in much the same way that the virtues of egalitarianism were taken for granted by a previous generation in its attitudes to tax new zealand has been the last colonial outpost of thatcherism change however may be in the air a fortnight ago the political year kicked off with national announcing its plan to subsidise tax payers against the effects of inflation and thereby stop the dreaded bracket creep that sees people being pushed by inflation into higher tax brackets while their actual purchasing power remains static or even in some cases declines in reality it was national s same old tax cuts package but in less toxic packaging this time on the other side of the political fence sir michael cullen s tax working group has just delivered to government its final report which is due for a public release in a couple of weeks the twg is widely expected to recommend a meaningful capital gains tax an innovation that has been decades overdue the report may also suggest the findings are non binding that a capital gains tax could be made revenue neutral by exempting the first 10 14 000 of earnings from income from tax altogether much media energy will be expended on guessing how much revenue the new capital gains tax might generate and or how it could be avoided advertisement scroll to continue reading while that s interesting it isn t really the point one major reason for instituting a meaningful capital gains tax is to ensure that all ways of generating wealth contribute their fair share to the general good people who routinely pay income tax on their wages should be welcoming the prospect that at long last the fortunate few who make their money from capital gains are going to be treated the same way for tax purposes as wage earners have been for decades lest we forget taxes are also a positive social mechanism progressive taxation a sends key signals as to where resources should be allocated b mitigates income inequality and c provides the state with the necessary funds to distribute where they will do most good eg to fund social services to support those most in need to build infrastructure and to invest in enterprises that offer long term social and economic benefits tax cuts on the other hand tend at best to deliver only a sugar fix that fuels consumption while wasting the opportunity for productive social investment look no further than how norway saved its oil earnings and created a massive trillion dollar investment fund for the long term benefit of all norwegians while britain in line with the thatcherite dogma of the time wasted its north sea oil earnings on tax cuts it isn t very hard to see which country has been left in better shape today by its tax and savings policy business of course always clamours for the corporate tax rate to be reduced across the tasman there has been a few telling examples of how tax cuts can detract from social investment the aussie economist john quiggin recently pointed this out between 1986 and 2001 the company tax rate in australia was reduced from 49 to its current level of 30 at the same time infrastructure privatisation policies handed responsibility for substantial areas of investment over to the private sector the outcome documented in a recent address by reserve bank governor guy debelle has been a steep decline in private business investment briefly interrupted by the mining boom how come aren t tax cuts meant to unleash the entrepreneurial spirit and free up the means for all sorts of innovation and productive investment no they evidently don t rather than investing their steadily growing profits businesses are returning them to shareholders through dividends and buybacks which now account for nearly 80 of all profits a major contributor to this trend has been the increasing share of profits going to the financial sector for which high dividends payouts have long been a point of pride the flip side of this is low rates of re investment made possible by the banks exceptionally high returns on equity which in turn are boosted by the various sharp practices now being exposed by the royal commission as quiggin also pointed out in december the round of fresh corporate tax cuts being p have negative externalities whereas low paying professions have positive externalities in other words if you don t seriously tax the rich and simultaneously address the effect of marginal rates on middle incomes you channel people towards socially useless or socially damaging professions and starve the rewards available for socially useful occupations so far national s tax indexation solution for middle incomes addresses only one half of that problem for an accessible argument in support of aoc s proposal this recent new york times article by the berkeley economics professor emmanuel saez makes it clear that she is not making a simplistic soak the rich argument similarly nobel economist paul krugman has usefully debunked the she s just a pretty face with weird ideas line of attack as he says ocasio cortez is more grounded in empirical economic research than her gop critics what krugman says here has obvious relevance to the upcoming tax debate in new zealand what if we take into account the reality that markets aren t perfectly competitive that there s a lot of monopoly power out there the answer is that this almost surely makes the case for even higher tax rates since high income people presumably get a lot of those monopoly rents so aoc far from showing her craziness is fully in line with serious economic research her critics on the other hand do indeed have crazy policy ideas and tax policy is at the heart of the crazy you see republicans almost universally advocate low taxes on the wealthy based on the claim that tax cuts at the top will have huge beneficial effects on the economy this claim rests on research by well nobody there isn t any body of serious work supporting g o p tax ideas because the evidence is overwhelmingly against those ideas the short term sugar fix of tax cuts is better described as what it is a political bribe meant to disguise the wider advantages thus being delivered to the few who stand to make even greater gains from lower tax rates the losers once the temporary sugar fix wears off would be those on low and middle incomes who still wouldn t be able to afford to pay the top dollars required for privatised medicine and education krugman again why do republicans adhere to a tax theory that has no support from nonpartisan economists and is refuted by all available data well ask who benefits from low taxes on the rich and it s obvious and because the party s coffers demand adherence to nonsense economics the party prefers economists who are obvious frauds and can t even fake their numbers effectively which brings me back to aoc and the constant effort to portray her as flaky and ignorant well on the tax issue she s just saying what good economists say and she definitely knows more economics than almost everyone in the g o p caucus not least because she doesn t know things that aren t true exactly new zealanders on the other hand have been schooled since the mid 1980s to believe things about tax policy that aren t true true stories like reggae country music derives much of its power from making tweaks to a limited set of templates that s why say the likes of kacey musgraves can sound so fresh while not really straying all that far from the source last

in 1974 the economist william nordhaus described the transition from a cowboy economy to a spaceship economy in the former he wrote we could afford to use our resources profligately and the environment could be used as a sink without becoming fouled but in the spaceship economy great attention must be paid to the sources of life and to the dumps where our refuse is piled he added things which have traditionally been treated as free goods air water quiet natural beauty must now be treated with the same care as other scarce goods toward the end of his landmark paper resources as a constraint on growth nordhaus discussed the possible adverse effects of energy consumption most notably the greenhouse effect from a rough calculation he found that the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide would increase by more than forty per cent in the next sixty years although this is below the fateful doubling of co 2 concentration he wrote scientists had already predicted that such a doubling could cause the polar ice caps to melt catastrophically it may well be too close for comfort he was prescient we are now dangerously on track to hit his estimate four hundred and eighty seven parts per million by 2030 in the united states after three years of decline carbon dioxide emissions increased by an estimated 3 4 per cent in 2018 according to a report released earlier this month by the rhodium group a private climate research firm the authors blame two main factors a particularly cold winter and fast economic growth in the past two decades the only greater annual gain in emissions was in 2010 when the economy was rebounding from the great recession historically emissions have aligned with the ebb and flow of the economy in 2018 economic growth was driven by a higher demand for energy trucking and air travel and industrial activity companies were manufacturing more stuff including steel cement and chemicals the carbon intensity of the power sector meanwhile did not decline fast enough to offset all those demand increases as has been common since nordhaus s 1974 paper the report seems to pit controlling climate change against a growing global economy the picture could have been much different nordhaus went on to publish a series of foundational studies on the economics of climate change in 1992 he created an integrated economic and scientific model that could be used to determine the most efficient ways to cut greenhouse gas emissions his work and that of many other economists who followed his lead showed that a low tax on carbon set to rise slowly over time could be enough to keep emissions at reasonable levels saving us from climate change at little if any cost a spaceship economy could thrive if governments made sure that companies paid an appropriate price for the environmental damage they caused what would come to be called the social cost of carbon companies that were most easily able to reduce their level of pollution would be incentivized to make the greatest reductions and to invest in cheaper and better pollution reduction systems the dirtiest activities would be the most costly the tax would promote innovations in new forms of power generation and eventually a widespread adoption of clean energy technologies the way to break the chain was to reimagine how we fuel the global economy it s absolutely the case that emissions and growth can be decoupled marshall burke an assistant professor in stanford university s department of earth system science told me he pointed to research plotting how thirty five countries including the united states did in fact experience economic growth in the past fifteen years while reducing their emissions and not solely due to recessions but the decline was not nearly enough the technology is available to have faster economic growth while reducing over all emissions trevor houser the head of rhodium group s energy and climate team and one of the authors of the report told me but the switch to nuclear and renewables needs to happen more rapidly it takes policy it won t happen through markets alone houser said in october nordhaus and another economist paul romer won the nobel prize in economic sciences for respectively integrating climate change and technological innovations into long run macroeconomic analysis the timing of the announcement from sweden was painfully ironic hours earlier the united nations had released its dire report warning that if climate change s worst impacts were to be avoided the nations of the world had about a decade to revolutionize the energy economy the policies are lagging very very far miles miles miles behind the science and what needs to be done nordhaus said after receiving the prize it s hard to be optimistic we re actually going backward in the united states with the disastrous policies of the trump administration the obama administration had in its final years partially incorporated concepts that nordhaus had helped to develop such as putting a price on the economic harm that results from every additional ton of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere the price was set at forty five dollars a ton and used in both regulatory cost benefit analyses which undergirded new fuel efficiency standards and the clean power plan which would have propelled a faster retirement of coal powered electric plants and a broader transition to renewables just as such policies were beginning to bear fruit houser said that whole framework was dismantled under trump the social cost of a ton of carbon is as little as one dollar as emissions keep growing and climate change advances there is less and less time to make the necessary cuts the pace we needed to decline was already much larger than what was happening houser told me now we have to go even faster to meet our paris agreement target by 2025 on average a 2 6 per cent reduction in annual energy related carbon dioxide emissions in the next seven years that is considerably faster than at any point in history he said and it will need to go even faster if declines in other greenhouse gases including methane and hydrofluorocarbons which endure in the atmosphere for much shorter amounts of time than carbon dioxide but are much more potent do not keep pace a modest carbon tax of the sort nordhaus proposed decades ago one that was then palatable to conservatives will therefore no longer bring us anywhere near the paris agreement targets but it s one of many weapons in the arsenal that policymakers need to employ the real challenge is finding ways to reduce emissions and maintain economic growth on the timeline demanded by the nature of climate change kenneth gillingham an associate professor of economics at yale university told me but as much as the costs of climate mitigation will undoubtedly increase the question is whether the benefits of mitigation exceed those costs it s a straw man and terrible economics to just point out the costs while ignoring the benefits burke said he and two co authors published a paper in nature last may that shows that the economic benefits of mitigation are going to be much larger than previously believed cooler temperatures would help maintain and grow productivity and reducing carbon emissions means reducing air pollution specifically particulate matter or soot which brings immediate health benefits they found that keeping global warming to one and a half degrees celsius which is nearly impossible at this point as opposed to two degrees celsius would potentially save more than twenty trillion dollars around the world by the end of the century and significantly reduce global inequality beyond two degrees they wrote we find considerably greater reductions in global economic output if nations met their commitments under the paris agreement the world would still see the average global temperature rise by two and a half to three degrees celsius which according to burke s paper would result in a fifteen to twenty five per cent reduction in per capita output by 2100 to just complain about the costs of this transition and ignore the benefits as is common in the discussion from this administration burke said is some pretty poor cost benefit analysis from an administration that prides itself on economic savvy as a small but growing coalition of congressional democrats led by representative alexandria ocasio cortez have outlined as part of their green new deal transforming the energy sector and really the entire economy in a just and more equitable way will require some sort of carbon tax preferably a fee and dividend approach which distributes tax revenues as rebates directly to citizens and also new regulations and huge investments we can decarbonize the electric sector at a fairly low cost gillingham told me that s where some of the cheapest emissions reductions are to be found extensive government subsidies could hasten the spread of renewables specifically solar wind and batteries and offset any rise in emissions elsewhere as gillingham said we might want to be careful about fighting climate change by preventing people from staying warm in the winter if a winter is really cold enough emissions increases are to be expected still there are ways to reduce the use of fossil fuels in heating utilities for instance can create incentive programs so that homeowners have a motivation to replace their boilers with electric heat pumps
rima m rakesh sharma moneycontrol contributors poet kaifi azmi once wrote story continues below advertisement remove ad aisa laga gareebi ki rekha se hoon buland poocha kisi ne haal kuchh aisi adaa ke saath i rose above the poverty line for a moment when someone asked just how i was doing he could have been speaking for all of india s poor who as usual in an election year are at the forefront of political debates the annual oxfam report has brought home the scale of inequality that exists in the country with statistics that have established what we have suspected all along that there is massive disparity in the distribution of wealth in the country and that the chasm between the haves and the havenots is only widening just to refresh your memory a bit the annual study by oxfam has stated that the wealth of billionaires in india rose by a whopping rs 2 200 crores a day in 2018 and the top one percent of india s wealthiest got richer by 39 percent compared to 3 percent growth in the incomes of the bottom 50 percent story continues below advertisement remove ad while political parties spar over who can finally eradicate this divide in the all important election year the fact staring them and us in the face is that the wealth of the top nine billionaires in india is equivalent to the wealth of the bottom 50 percent of the population and 60 percent or the majority of the population own merely 4 8 percent of the national wealth the opposition especially the congress once infamous for the gareebi hatao slogan that almost attracted as much derision as the by now discredited catchphrase india shining has accused the government of being anti poor the congress after winning a few recent key elections in madhya pradesh rajasthan and chhattisgarh on the back of promised farm loan waivers has proposed the implementation of the minimum guarantee scheme theoretically known as the universal basic income ubi scheme and this idea of a universal basic income is what we dig deep into on this edition of digging deeper with moneycontrol with me rakesh sharma is universal basic income a timely intervention let us try and understand at the onset why this idea is suddenly creating so many ripples to begin with the timing of the idea seems astute as it comes against the backdrop of rising discontent over banking scams that have brought home to us the porous system that facilitates the siphoning of public money there is the obvious agrarian distress and as per the recent explosive business standard report rising unemployment figures that the national sample survey office s periodic labour force survey has marked at a 45 year high of 6 1 percent in 2017 18 the niti aayog has refuted these claims according to news18 two independent members of the national statistical commission had resigned this week after the government allegedly failed to publish the report that was prepared last month the report is still not public this is the first survey on employment by a government agency after demonetization of rs 500 and rs 1 000 currency notes in november 2016 as reports by multiple news sources said the periodic labour force survey is the first annual household survey of the national sample survey office and data was collected between july 2017 and june 2018 news18 said documents reviewed by business standard showed that unemployment rate was at its highest since the 1972 73 period from when the employment data is comparable in comparison the unemployment rate stood at 2 2 in 2011 12 during the united progressive alliance s second term according to the survey the report showed that the unemployment rate among the youth was at a higher level compared to previous years and much higher compared to that in the overall population according to the report more among the educated were jobless in 2017 18 than they were in 2004 05 for educated women in rural areas unemployment was at 17 3 percent in 2017 18 compared to 9 7 percent 15 2 percent during 2004 05 to 2011 12 for educated men in rural areas the unemployment rate rose to 10 5 percent in 2017 18 compared to 3 5 percent to 4 4 percent during 2004 05 to 2011 12 add to this the points made by the oxfam report according to which india s top 10 percent population holds 77 4 percent of the total national wealth a deeper study of the data in the report shows the top one percent have cornered 51 53 percent of the national wealth while the remaining 99 percent make do with only about 48 percent oxfam india ceo amitabh behar after the release of the report said the survey reveals how governments are exacerbating inequality by underfunding public services such as healthcare and education on the one hand while under taxing corporations and the wealthy and failing to clamp down on tax dodging on the other and the shock and outrage over the latest report notwithstanding oxfam has always presented us with uncomfortable home truths in january 2018 oxfam had reported that 73 percent of the wealth generated in the year before had gone to the richest one percent while 67 crore indians who comprise the poorest half of the population saw one percent increase in their wealth their past reports have indicated give or take a few marginal differences that over the next 20 years 500 of the world s richest people will hand over 2 4 trillion to their heirs a sum larger than the gdp of india a country of 1 3 billion people we learnt that hard work is no guarantee for wealth generation and that in countries like india and the philippines at least one in every two workers in the garment sector is paid below the minimum wage and that it would take 941 years for a minimum wage worker in rural india to earn what the top paid executive at a leading indian garment company earns in a year it would take around 17 5 days for the best paid executive at a top indian garment company to earn what a minimum wage worker in rural india will earn in their lifetime presuming 50 years at work in 2018 oxfam had also proposed a simple way to bridge this gap marginally and stated that if we assume that in the next 20 years at least rs 10 544 billion will be passed on to the inheritors and on that if 30 inheritance tax is imposed the government can earn at least rs 3176 billion rs 3176 billion is sufficient to finance six crucial services medical public health family welfare water sanitation housing urban development and labour labour welfare in all states the poor that went missing from our idea of india economic inequality is never a sudden phenomenon and india has always been a country of extreme disparities a feature seen prominently in the poetry of progressive socialist urdu poets like kaifi and sahir ludhianvi in the fifties in film songs and even in cinematic narratives in almost every decade the mazdoor the kisaan the taxi driver the daily wage workers the coal miners featured in the biggest blockbusters of the 50s 60s and 70s and even manoj kumar the tireless nationalist exhausted with hope and cognisant of the distance between aspiration and reality made a film like roti kapda aur makaan in the seventies with a song damning the ever present mehengai or the rising cost of living that made it impossible for the poor to live eat and exist with dignity today of course the country s poor feature rarely if ever in a cinema that largely caters to the idea of india as an omnificent global power regardless of the alarming unemployment numbers agrarian unrest and the struggles faced by small businesses in such a scenario the idea of universal basic income sounds like a compelling panacea but is it a good idea nidhi chugh wrote in cnbc recently that it might not be for developed countries says she the scheme is simply to fix the hurdles that are blocking the economy to achieve optimal growth but when it comes to implementing ubi in a developing country like india it s a different ballgame altogether she says from cnbc the ubi the unconditional cash transfer system requires the economy to be financially strong to fund the programme making it the key reason for developed countries to have an upper hand in implementing the scheme the ubi is one of the most debated topics not only in india but across the globe some developed countries including the scandinavian countries are running pilots and may eventually make it a social welfare norm jayati ghosh an economics professor at jawaharlal nehru university describes three key problems in implementing ubi in developing countries according to ghosh developing countries have to strengthen their fiscal policies and make them more people friendly so that when the scheme is implemented people are able to bear the fruits she also says that because of the vast population and the existing social and class divide it will be difficult for the government to cater to the needs of the people efficiently the cnbc piece also cites the economic survey an annual report on the state of india s economy which shows that there are only 7 taxpayers for every 100 voters in the country so obviously there is the question of insufficient funds that will make the implementation of ubi tough ubi will also have to do away with the existing social welfare schemes is this then a utopian but ultimately false promise dissent a left leaning intellectual magazine published by the university of pennsylvania press on behalf of the foundation for the study of independent social ideas brings in a global perspective to the debate and discusses how universal basic income an idea long dismissed as utopian is now gaining traction on both the right and the left but it says that ubi s supporters on the left should proceed with caution could ubi be a part of a twenty first century vision for the labor movement asks alyssa battistoni a phd candidate in political science at yale university and an editor at jacobin magazine well the jury is out on that one but as the piece points out the idea has seen renewed interest since the 2008 financial crash as millions of people lost their jobs and wondered whether they d find new ones here it is important to interject that generations of conservative leaders in the us have cited novelist ayn rand s objectivist ideas to undermine the idea of the rich paying for the well being of the poor while conveniently ignoring the atheistic anti establishment strains in her work but with growing disillusion with crony capitalism and the rise in democratic ranks of young leaders like alexandria ocasio cortez the idea of higher taxes for the rich to fund social welfare is being increasingly mainstreamed moreover democratic sen ed markey of massachusetts has been working with cortez on a green new deal legislation that will be unveiled soon and which according to cnn will address issues such as job creation emission reductions greening infrastructure and a variety of principles that would come with a robust climate change package the idea is to make capitalist practices more responsible and the normalisation of ubi as a political idea as dissent magazine points out is becoming more widespread ubi was recently endorsed by movement for black lives while canada s leap manifesto calls for consideration of ubi on the grounds of environmental sustainability the piece also mentions jeremy corbyn as an important voice in the debate and he said last september that the labour party would investigate the prospects for basic income in the uk and experiments are on the agenda in scotland backed by the left wing scottish national party we quote growing public discussion has been accompanied by a small but significant number of experimental programs mostly in europe the united states is also home to the closest thing to a basic income program existing in the world today the alaska permanent fund since 1982 the fund has paid every alaskan resident anywhere from a few hundred to 2 000 annually out of its oil revenues but the most prominent supporters of ubi in the united states today are technocapitalists like peter thiel and marc andreessen and with the exception of alaska basic income experiments are being implemented not by the state but the private sector most notably the seed accelerator y combinator is starting a basic income pilot program in oakland proposing to pay a hundred families between 1 000 and 2 000 each month no strings attached two colliding worldviews ubi evokes two conflicting responses in those who speak against and for it as dissent says one view functions as a kind of noblesse oblige a handout to the unfortunates and another view point version aspires to egalitarian universalism and challenges the legitimacy of privately accumulated wealth the important thing to ascertain at this point is whether universal basic income can become more than a political ploy for the right and the left to fight over in india and if it can go on to become a tool of social equity there is something to be said about the potential of the idea and as dissent says capitalism s inability to provide a means of making a decent living for the over 7 billion people currently alive is one of its most glaring defects and one of the most significant opportunities for the left to offer an alternative a universal basic income though not the only answer might point us in the right direction the piece also cites andy stern the former head of the seiu whose 2016 book raising the floor explains why basic income is the way to invent a better future there is also dutch journalist and basic income advocate rutger bregman for whom basic income represents the way to true human fulfillment the post work utopia that we need and that we can in fact achieve especially at a time when productivity gains have reaped profits for owners of capital and made life harder for those who are working harder than ever to cling to their jobs parsed in the context of these views it seems easy to deduce that in a country like india a universal basic income could reduce crime child mortality malnutrition and teen pregnancy and increase gender equality educational outcomes and economic growth but the piece also cautions that for ubi to be a genuine step toward a post work society it has to be genuinely universal and unconditional provide enough income to actually live on and supplement rather than replace the welfare state we quote in recent years ubi pilot programs have rolled out in namibia kenya and uganda mostly funded by ngos more generally cash transfer programs which aim to diminish poverty by giving poor people money though often with specific criteria or restrictions are the latest fad in development the use of the word fads trivialises the help the world s poor need to rise above their disadvantages but it also sums up how easy it to think of ubi as a passing political fancy rather than a real practical solution to poverty as the punchline of the piece says utopia is possible if we want it though we ll need to make it a part of the demands and visions of the left movements we build over the next few years because we can t just invent the future we re going to have to fight for it the indian perspective the wire recently asked the question that we have been exploring in this podcast can universal basic income help create an equitable society or could a variant of ubi a negative income tax likely be a better fit for india in response writer nikhil george a research assistant at the department of economics at monk prayogshala a not for profit academic research organisation based in mumbai cites the example of scandinavian countries to prove that an equitable society is not only theoretically plausible but also practically feasible but he also adds that the nordic model cannot be implemented in india owing to population levels and per capita income ubi he points out is not a new fangled idea in the indian context the country has experimented with numerous poverty alleviation schemes over the decades and the government of india had even proposed the introduction of ubi in the indian economic survey 2015 16 ubi in simple terms as george explains is a form of social security where all citizens receive an unconditional sum of money it was originally considered for one of two reasons says the piece as we are moving towards a more technologically competent world a large portion of the workforce in various sectors such as agriculture may become redundant as a result ubi would be granted in order to compensate for the losses to make ends meet whereas in a developing world ubi was proposed to help reduce the overall inequality levels ubi if implemented would cost the government around 4 5 of the gdp and would see 70 of the population receive rs 650 per month according to the estimates done by the indian economic survey in this sense india would implement a quasi universal basic income the wire currently there exist nearly 940 central sector and centrally sponsored schemes i e food and urea subsidies where many of them are minute in terms of allocation and have existed for decades the administrative costs alone for running these schemes are substantial coupled with the leakages and the burden of identifying beneficiaries which further places strain on governmental agencies that are often plagued with issues of inadequate capacity if this is the case why haven t governments already introduced a scheme that reduces such burdens with the introduction of ubi subsidies such as kerosene and fertilisers will cease to exist exposing various sections of the population to market risks along similar lines this could possibly erode the pressures on the state to provide for health and education these are significant problems that need to be considered however would the provision of rs 650 per month help reduce inequality levels the point is says the writer augmenting 70 of the population with fungible transfers does not create an equitable society therefore as variants of the current model exist the government should opt for an approach that brings about a greater balance to society an alternative approach could include the introduction of a negative income tax nit as a social policy we quote currently under 2 of the indian population pays income tax simply put as agricultural activity in the country is not taxable a significant proportion of people are employed in the informal sector as over 90 of indians earn less than rs 2 5 lakh annually and are hence exempt from paying income tax a significant tax base doesn t exist the lack of adherence from certain sections of the population due to tax morale also plays a vital role in creating the difference between the number of citizens registered under the taxable bracket and those who file for income tax the introduction of nit would register people under a tax bracket even though they would not be liable to pay taxes in order to avail accrued benefits individuals will have to register their income levels in this regard itself an nit is superior to a generic ubi but in a country as unwieldy as india the administrative costs associated with the creation of such a system will be considerable we quote as most people are not liable or do not pay taxes it could be difficult to implement such a programme wholesale macroeconomic changes are associated with significant costs as with other policy decisions nit will have its own set of problems that can only be solved with time however with the introduction of the nit we move one step closer in trying to bring about an equitable balance to society poverty cannot be wished away brookings an american thinktank that conducts research and education in the social sciences primarily in economics metropolitan policy governance foreign policy and global economy and development has deduced that based on current projections the world will not end poverty by 2030 poverty will likely be lower by about 200 million people but 438 million people or 5 percent of the world s population will still live in extreme poverty so can the universal basic income solve global inequalities a february 2017 report by unesco inclusive policy lab discussed how ubi is spreading and becoming front and centre in the public discussion it asked what if this idea suggesting a flat income given to every citizen regardless of employment or social status was part of the solution to today s inequalities what about india specifically milan vaishnav a senior fellow and director of the south asia program at the carnegie endowment for international peace recently discussed in the washington post just how loaded this question is at a time when nearly 900 million indians will be eligible to cast their votes in nationwide general elections the point pits the ruling government s announcement that it would guarantee 10 percent of university seats and civil service posts for the economically weaker sections of the populace untouched by existing affirmative action programs against congress president rahul gandhi s unveiling of what is likely to be his party s signature campaign priority a universal basic income for poor families across the country the official statement being we cannot build a new india while millions of our brothers sisters suffer the scourge of poverty if voted to power in 2019 the congress is committed to a minimum income guarantee for every poor person to help eradicate poverty hunger this is our vision our promise this was a political curveball right ahead of friday s budget though it offered no specifics except an affirmation of intention milan vaishnav also points out that two opposition controlled states telangana and odisha have already implemented a partial income guarantee scheme squarely aimed at lifting farmers incomes more recently the ruling party in the state of sikkim a bjp ally has announced it will unveil a comprehensive universal basic income by 2022 from the post implementing any large scale income support program calls for two essential ingredients state capacity and fiscal resources unfortunately both are in short supply in india the country s social service plumbing is notoriously feeble india s welfare machinery suffers from endemic leakage or corruption and poor targeting an inability to properly identify and deliver benefits to eligible recipients furthermore india s fiscal accounts are underwater last week the international monetary fund s chief economist flagged the country s fiscal deficit as a major economic risk factor especially in an election year prone to populist giveaways the writer says that neither the congress nor the bjp has grappled with the realities of implementing a universal basic income for 200 million rural households but a proposal unveiled this week by a team led by arvind subramanian the former chief economic adviser to the modi government provides a tantalizing blueprint for dispensing cash to india s neediest citizens while potentially circumventing the country s administrative infirmities subramanian now a visiting lecturer at the harvard kennedy school and his co authors have called for the next indian government to implement what they call a qubri or a quasi universal basic rural income for india we quote the idea is simple enough the government would provide an annual lump sum payment to every poor rural household in india no questions asked as a financial safety net the proposal suggests an annual transfer of 18 000 rupees 1 500 rupees per month to each eligible rural household about 250 annually to target recipients effectively the proposed qubri would exclude the richest 25 percent of households transfers would be sent electronically to recipient bank accounts which are ubiquitous now even in remote areas thanks to a recent government effort to universalize banking access the authors estimate the costs of the scheme would be around 1 3 percent of india s gross domestic product a significant chunk of which would come from eliminating a raft of regressive agricultural subsidies this sounds wonderful in practice but the politics are not nearly as cut and dry for starters if eliminating farmer subsidies were painless the government would have done it a long time ago research suggests that many indians are leery of giving up existing subsidies in favor of uncertain cash transfers moreover the existing debate is exclusively focused on india s rural dwellers when it is india s urban population that is burgeoning as migrants flock to cities in search of opportunity the inadequacy of formal sector jobs and the abysmal state of urban amenities suggest it is only a matter of time before urban residents demand their share of government largesse and the last word as milan says for now technical details will be left to the economists and opinion writers to debate for india s politicians there s an election to be won but the question remains will the indian electorate really be wooed by a mere promise of easy cash in 2014 voters were drawn to modi like a moth to a flame swayed by his pledge of ushering in acche din good times for the indian economy generating millions of jobs and reviving india s moribund investment cycle five years later his promises remain unfulfilled and voters for their part have begun to expect more a complex idea simplified prasanna mohanty wrote in india today this week that congress promise to ensure minimum income guarantee for the poor has brought the ubi debate into the mainstream with the tempting prospect of a guaranteed monthly basic income being dispensed to every single citizen of a country regardless of her social educational or economic standing but the piece tried to go beyond the broad strokes in which the idea of ubi is painted to understand the fine print in 2016 17 as we pointed out earlier the economic survey of india presented a model for ubi the basic premise of the economic survey s ubi was a just society needs to guarantee to each individual a minimum income which they can count on and which provides the necessary material foundation for a life with access to basic goods and a life of dignity the piece says that the economic survey of india s model of ubi suggested providing rs 7 620 per annum to 75 percent of india s population we quote now rahul gandhi s plan seems to target only the poor rahul gandhi has not said whether his proposed minimum income guarantee will cover 22 percent of the population or 29 5 percent also rahul gandhi has not declared what the minimum income has would be unquote so what is the essential difference between ubi and minimum income guarantee the answer is and we quote a universal basic income provides a monthly stipend that would ensure that a person would be above the poverty line without any other source of income thus the economic survey of india suggested a ubi of rs 7 620 per annum a minimum income guarantee on the other hand is pretty much at the discretion of the government of the day it can be equal more or less than the poverty line expenditure a way to liberty and equality basicincome org lists the reasons that have all been invoked in universal basic income s favour including liberty and equality efficiency and community common ownership of the earth and equal sharing in the benefits of technical progress the flexibility of the labour market and the dignity of the poor the fight against inhumane working conditions against the desertification of the countryside and against interregional inequalities the viability of cooperatives and the promotion of adult education autonomy from bosses husbands and bureaucrats we quote the inability to tackle unemployment with conventional means has in the last decade or so become a major reason for the idea being taken seriously social policy and economic policy can no longer be conceived separately and basic income is increasingly viewed as the only viable way of reconciling two of their respective central objectives poverty relief and full employment grassroots activism for basic income has increased greatly since 2010 in addition many prominent european social scientists have now come out in favour of it among them several nobel laureates in economics in a few countries some major politicians including from parties in government are also beginning to stick their necks out in support of it at the same time the relevant literature on the economic ethical political and legal aspects is gradually expanding and those promoting the idea or just interested in it in various european countries and across the world have started organizing into active networks yet the proposal also receives strong political resistance in most countries for now as a well known economist and a former prime minister said on the cusp of india s economic liberalisation we are witnessing an idea whose time has come the idea of ubi is however far more complex than it seems on paper its implementation will require more than just political grandstanding as we have learnt over the years promises are cheap in political lexicon it is the implementation that is expensive and causes more harm that good when executed without enough rumination

have also included an updated investor presentation on this section of our website amg encourages investors to consult the investor relations section of its website regularly for updated information with us on the line to discuss the company s results for the quarter are nate dalton chief executive officer and jay horgen president and chief financial officer with that i ll turn the call over to nate nathaniel dalton chief executive officer thanks jeff and good morning everyone as we all know the fourth quarter of 2018 was challenging for us at managers due to broadly negative returns across asset classes as well as the resulting client risk aversion which impacted industry wide flows in addition the quarter had several extraordinary items that i wanted to briefly put into context our results and forward outlook first while net client cash flows were negative due to both heightened client risk aversion as well as the fourth quarter seasonality we discussed on our last call our organic growth outlook is already improving in 2019 second our business is structured differently from other asset management firms this includes not only the diversity of our business and the quality of our affiliates but also importantly our investment structure which limits our exposure to operating leverage at the affiliate level providing earning stability third we are actively positioning our business to focus on the highest growth opportunities ahead finally because we ve been disciplined in managing our balance sheet and we have the flexibility to execute on the opportunities this volatility will inevitably create now turning to the quarter amg reported economics earnings per share of 3 53 for the fourth quarter and 14 50 for the full year while q4 was down versus a year ago primarily because of lower performance fees our results for 2018 were in line with those for the full year 2017 the combination of the timing of the market declines at the very end of the year with the breadth of the declines across asset classes and while a number of our alternative strategies generate good relative performance they still had low or negative cash flow returns and therefore we realized lower performance fees than we expected as we look forward our performance fee opportunity is broad and diverse across a range of distinctive return streams with very good track records of outperformance as a result we are confident that performance fees will be a meaningful component of our future earnings growth profile as they have been in the past turning next to flows there were a couple of high level themes that shaped our quarter in general elevated market volatility in the fourth quarter increased industrywide client risk aversion which led to slowing sales activity and delayed funding in addition we had elevated levels of retail redemptions and equities and liquid alternatives due to fourth quarter seasonality which in the case of liquid alternatives was exacerbated by significant outflows from products with challenging recent performance relative to benchmark while still early in the first quarter we were off to a much better start in 2019 we take a look at our publicly available data for january our retail net flows are roughly flat and while some of that is a reversal of the q4 seasonality which was particularly acute for us in 2018 the best retail month we ve seen since last april putting this all together we expect good 2018 performance by many of our affiliates as well as improving flow trend dynamics driving much better q1 net flow results and continued improvement throughout 2019 now while it was an extraordinary quarter in terms of the breadth of negative returns and client risk aversion it s important to remain focused on the key elements of our business as we execute our growth strategy let me first start with the importance of diversity over the past decade we ve built an incredibly diverse business through both the addition of new affiliates as well as organic growth through product development and innovation by the collective efforts of amg and our affiliates today our portfolio is diverse only by asset class and product category loss of client segment geography and channel as well as by affiliate there s no single affiliate contributing more than a low teens percentage to our ebitda in the fourth quarter even with the extraordinary breadth of negative market returns we saw the benefits of the diversity of our asset mix which is approximately 40 in alternative strategies for example our blended asset mix declined by roughly 8 in the quarter compared to the 13 decline in the msci world while diversity is obviously important even more important is the ability of our affiliates to sustain high quality distinctive return streams across a broad set of asset classes with the return of volatility many of our fundamental strategies outpace their respective indices and peers in the fourth quarter as well as for the full year we believe that in general volatility is good for asset managers as we noted last quarter the data from our recently updated whitepaper the boutique premium illustrates that the long term outperformance advantage of boutique has been most significant during more volatile periods where their investment processes and disciplines are able to create significant outlook for their client this stands to reason as the elements that drive superior alpha generation by boutiques in the first place and investment led entrepreneurial culture meaningful equity ownership by the investment professionals and a long duration alignment with clients and partners all supporting long term perspective which encourages these firms to maintain their investment processes through volatile periods we re already seeing this reflected in our business as the fourth quarter provided a more favorable environment for the highest quality asset managers such as our affiliates that distinguish themselves while outperformance was broadly diversified across affiliates and geographies global us and up and down the cap range this outperformance was most prominent at some of our world class value firms such as tweedy browne yacktman veritas beutel and river road the combination of market volatility and very significant outperformance is leading to a noticeable uptick in client interest and demand across channel in addition to our strong performance across many fundamental equity strategies a number of our liquid alternative products that affiliates such as aqr capula artemis efm and winton posted strong relative returns which should position them to raise assets going forward while performance across our existing products and capabilities is critically important we and our affiliates have been continuously innovating and developing new products with diverse distinctive returns streams to match evolving needs across all market environments as we talked about in our last call we have a differentiated product development approach we benefit from product development that happens within our affiliates as well as from products we develop jointly with affiliates of course our unique opportunity to add immediately saleable products with proven track record in order to invest with them this unique product development opportunity has been successful in creating a significant number of new products in the last five years including some of our fastest growing products examples are many and diverse across our traditional management firms such as artemis and timesquare are launching entire product suites of global international and emerging market strategies in the case of gwk they re building out an equity franchise domestic and global as well as most recently adding trilogies to proven emerging markets within liquid alternatives firms such as blue mountain capula and first quadrant are taking advantage of market opportunities to build out ranges of systematic product in areas such as alternative credit market neutral global macro and volatility our illiquid alternative managers also continue to diversify their product offering with pantheon offering infrastructure real asset and credit bearing asia extending into credit and real estate products and the introduction of credit direct lending and operating capabilities at eig lastly aqr continues to innovate its existing equity and alternatives franchises and is in the early innings of what could be a very significant systematic fixed income buildout alongside this product development opportunities our unique distribution strategy which combines the focused resources of each of our affiliates with the scope and scale of amg s global distribution platforms is an increasingly valuable component of our overall growth strategy this model affords our affiliates the opportunity to diversify their distribution capabilities and bring their spending products to the most appropriate pools of capital worldwide moreover as leading clients worldwide and the intermediaries who serve them are consolidating their relationships with external managers looking for more efficient relationships and even partnership with a smaller number of investment management firms amg and our unique model are beginning to capitalize on those trends and we can bring to bear the largest collection of independently managed distinctive return streams in the world as we discussed last quarter we ve been making progress and formalizing some of these relationships for example we entered into a strategic relationship with nordea asset management where we will work together to develop and place certain amg affiliate strategies on their european and latin american platforms simply put we re collectively leveraging our affiliates in manufacturing and product design and structuring work with nordea s strong brand scale packaging and distribution expertise in a strategic and addictive way to our existing efforts in these regions we are currently very active in working on a number of near term opportunities with them as well as the operational elements of this relationship as we discussed on previous calls while this is a relatively new initiative for amg we re making good progress toward establishing a range of these strategic relationships with something more formal and some less so finally as we also discussed in recent quarters we ve been actively reviewing our business to identify opportunities to improve efficiency in general and in particular to make sure that amg and their affiliates resources are focused on the risk adjusted return opportunities in the market at the affiliate level we continue to support the positioning of their businesses for future opportunities in some cases this has included strategic activity such as the combination of trilogy and their emerging markets investing team in the gwk resulting in enhanced opportunities for their collective clients and increasing both the growth opportunity and efficiency for gwk and amg as jay will explain further in a moment we also reduced operating expenses at amg and work with many of our affiliates including where we participate in categories of expenses to help them ensure they are aligning the infrastructures of their business with the opportunities and challenges they see ahead now in addition to these elements of organic growth in our existing business we have another complementary growth engine amg s business model provides a significant opportunity to generate increased earnings as well as to add immediately saleable products through investments in excellent new affiliates amg s equity ownership succession solution is very attractive to asset management boutiques that value their independence want a permanent solution and access the scale of distribution platforms we continue to actively develop our proprietary relationships with leading boutiques while the volatility of the fourth quarter inevitably impacted some discussions and more broadly the pace of activity is inherently based on the dynamics of each prospective affiliate we have a good pipeline of high quality new prospects but we remain disciplined on pricing and alignment particularly at this stage of the cycle in addition as jay will describe further we continue to position our balance sheet to prioritize flexibility and prudent financial leverage in anticipation of continued market volatility which in our experience often creates the most compelling investment opportunity in addition to maintaining the financial flexibility to invest in new affiliates and continuing to execute on the other elements of our growth strategy we also remain committed to consistently returning capital to our shareholders and we demonstrated this disciplined approach to capital allocation again in the fourth quarter finally while these are volatile signs we built our business with diversity across multiple dimensions asset class geography channel and affiliates across this diversity we have very high quality distinctive return streams managed by extraordinarily experienced investment teams we also have a unique strategy with low operating leverage as you think about the revenue sharing model which underpins a significant majority of our business and we have prudent financial leverage these characteristics differentiate from other asset management firms while providing stability as volatility continues but also importantly position us to take advantage of the opportunities this volatility will inevitably create now before i turn to jay i want to congratulate him on his appointment to president and thank him for his significant contributions as an integral member of amg s senior team for many years but in particular i wanted to acknowledge his hard work and the true partnership he brought to shawn and to me through the ceo transition shawn and i are looking forward to working with him in his new role as we grow our business and create long term shareholder value with that i ll turn it to jay jay horgen president and chief financial officer good morning and thank you nate for your kind comments i echo the sentiment and i look forward to contributing in my new expanded role as nate discussed amg s fourth quarter results were impacted by client risk aversion and declining markets especially in the last two months of the year as reflected in both our net client cash flows for the quarter as well as our annual earnings contribution from performance fees we also had a number of one time items in the quarter which i will describe in a moment in contrast to december we have seen a marked improvement in both client cash flows and markets in january additionally we are beginning to realize the benefits from expense management actions taken in the fourth quarter finally with an uplift in markets and a new calendar year we expect material growth and the contribution of performance fees to our earnings in 2019 on flows generally we experienced a higher level of redemptions from seasonality in the fourth quarter than in prior years which included tax loss harvesting and selling ahead of year end mutual fund distributions in the retail channel as well as the expiration of annual liquidity lockup and single and multi year vehicles in both the institutional and high net worth channel taken together in the fourth quarter we estimate the effect of seasonality and our quarterly flows which was exacerbated by the market environment to be between 7 billion and 9 billion in addition elevated volatility in the fourth quarter increased industrywide client risk aversion which led to slowing sales activity and delayed funding especially in the institutional channel looking ahead the first quarter typically brings a reversal to positive seasonal factors in our net client cash flow additionally improvement in our fundamental equity performance is already contributing to positive publicly visible flows thus far in january turning to our flows by asset class and starting with alternatives which account for 40 of our aum we reported outflows of 9 5 billion driven by our liquid alternative strategies and partially offset by positive contributions from our illiquid product set our illiquids which include strategies such as global and regional private equity co investment credit real asset infrastructure and real estate had a solid level of funding in the fourth quarter we continue to see a steadily growing opportunity in illiquid as our affiliates build further on existing and new product capabilities amg s aggregate performance in illiquids is very strong with 92 of our recent funds outperforming industry benchmarks on a net ir basis and 82 outperforming on a net multiple basis in our liquid alternatives category encompassing our multi strategy systematic diversified and fixed income and equity relative value strategies we saw significant outflows as a result of challenging recent relative performance which was exacerbated by seasonality especially in the retail channel in the last two months of the year our long term investment performance in liquid alternatives remain strong with 56 and 82 of our assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over a three and five year period respectively now turning to equities which account for 46 of our aum in the global equities category we saw net outflows of 3 billion in the quarter almost entirely driven by emerging market products amg continues to generate good long term aggregate performance in this category with approximately 56 of our assets under management ahead of benchmarks over a five year period notwithstanding that our three year number was impacted by challenging performance in emerging market products among our affiliates in this category are some of the industry leading global and emerging market managers who continue to have excellent competitive position in us equities we reported net outflows of 3 9 billion due to fourth quarter seasonality and macro industry trends however looking at our public flows for january we re beginning to see the benefits of significantly improved performance in this category a number of our largest fundamental value equity managers are top quartile performers on a relative basis we now have 51 of our aum outperforming benchmarks on a three year basis in us equities a notable improvement relative to prior years turning to the multi asset and other category which accounts for 14 of our aum and encompasses multi asset and balance mandates within our wealth management business as well as a number of specialty fixed income and multi asset products here we posted 600 million in net inflows primarily driven by our systematic fixed income product which continued to generate good slow momentum as well as our wealth management where a positive demand trends remain in place now turning to our financials as you saw in the release economics per share decreased by 25 to 3 53 for the fourth quarter including 0 15 of net performance fees this decline was largely due to a decrease in net performance fees down from 1 09 a year ago on a gaap basis we reported earnings per share of 2 88 reflecting the reduction in carrying value of systematica for the fourth quarter aggregate fees decreased 27 to 1 2 billion from a year ago and the ratio of aggregate fees to average assets under management declined year over year from 82 basis points to 63 basis points entirely driven by lower performance fees notably the ratio advisory fees to average assets under management remain flat year over year adjusted ebitda decreased 47 to 191 3 million from a year ago primarily due to the timing and impact of negative markets at the very end of 2018 which led to significantly lower performance fees and other income for the year in addition ebitda was lower due to a number of non recurring expenses including fourth quarter items related to expense management and amg s donation to mass general hospital excluding these one time items our fourth quarter adjusted ebitda would have been 221 million relative to adjusted ebtida the smaller year over year declines in economic net income of 29 and economics earnings per share of 25 reflected lower taxes from us tax reform a one time tax benefit from the liquidation of ivory as well as lower year over year share count due to repurchase activity in the case of economic earnings per share turning to more specific modeling items for the fourth quarter the ratio of adjusted ebitda to average assets under management was 9 9 basis points however excluding the one time expenses i previously mentioned it would have been 11 4 basis points or 10 8 basis points excluding performance fees in the first quarter we expect adjusted ebitda to average assets under management to be in the range of 11 3 basis points to 11 7 basis points reflecting a net performance fee range of 0 10 per share to 0 20 per share stepping back on performance fee guidance for the full year 2019 we expect performance fee contribution to be in the range of 0 75 to 1 75 per share this performance fee range incorporates product high water marks actual performance through january and a reasonable range around forward growth assumptions across all of our performance fee products as you know we have seasonality in our performance fee opportunity with a large majority of performance fee contracts having calendar year end crystallization and very few contracts crystallizing in the second and third quarter our share of interest expense was 18 1 million for the fourth quarter and in the first quarter we expect our share of interest expense to remain at approximately 18 million our share of reported amortization and impairments was 288 million for the fourth quarter including 261 9 million from affiliates accounted for under the equity method as you saw in the release this included the 240 million non cash charge i mentioned earlier looking ahead to the first quarter we expect our share of reported amortization and impairments to be approximately 45 million turning to taxes with regard to our tax rate in the fourth quarter our effective gaap and cash tax rates were impacted by one time items as a result our gaap tax rate was negative and our cash tax rate was 15 7 for modeling purposes we expect our gaap and cash tax rates to be approximately 26 and 18 respectively intangible related deferred taxes were 49 6 million in the fourth quarter which were elevated for the liquidation of ivory and certain other non cash items related to us tax reform for the first quarter we expect intangible related deferred taxes to be approximately 11 million other economic items were 500 000 00 for the fourth quarter and for modeling purposes we expect other economic items to be approximately 1 million per quarter our adjusted weighted average share count for the fourth quarter was 52 7 million and we expect it to be approximately 51 8 million for the first quarter turning to our balance sheet on capital management broadly speaking we have maintained a prudent level of leverage to be able to capitalize on growth opportunities even in challenging markets in addition we have continued to return capital to our shareholders within a framework of disciplined capital management during the fourth quarter in the midst of a volatile market we paid a 0 30 per share dividend and repurchased 76 million in shares while continuing to position our balance sheet including extending the maturity of our evolver and term loan looking ahead as you saw in the release we announced a first quarter dividend of 0 32 per share which reflects a 0 07 increase as well as a 3 3 million share increase to our repurchase authorization for a total of 5 million shares the first half of 2019 we expect to repurchase between 100 million and 300 million in shares however the amount and timing will depend on the potential new investment and market conditions before we take questions i d like to make one final point over the past five years we have reduced our financial leverage as part of our disciplined approach to capital management as you heard nate say amg s unique revenue share structure is in place across the large majority of our affiliate group limits our exposure to operating leverage which in periods of heightened volatility enhances the stability of our earnings this combination of prudent financial leverage and limited operating leverage gives us the flexibility to deploy capital and capitalize on our growth opportunities including in periods of market dislocation now we will be happy to answer your questions questions and answers operator thank you at this time we ll be conducting a question and answer session if you d like to ask a question please press 1 on your telephone keypad a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue you may press 2 if you d like to remove your question from the queue for participants using speaker equipment it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the key our first question comes from the line of bill katz with citigroup please proceed with your question bill katz citigroup analyst jay congratulations on the promotion maybe we can start there given the promotion i was wondering what if any change in strategy there might be or maybe just tick off the top two or three incremental things you re looking at as we think about 2019 and beyond jay horgen president and chief financial officer thank you bill you know this and i think most everyone on the phone i ve been at amg for 12 years now i ve been involved in the strategic decisions across multiple aspects of our business for some time including distribution this new role is simply an evolution of my responsibilities it s not a change or major change for our business i ve been working closely with the head of our global distribution hugh cutler has been with us for a couple of years now on a number of projects he s doing a nice job he s got a great team i look forward to helping him grow our business in this area in addition to my new responsibilities in distribution i will continue to be involved in all aspects of our business as a senior member of the team nathaniel dalton chief executive officer maybe bill i ll add something to that we talked about this a couple calls ago but we ve got an excellent senior team with a really good balanced mix of people who have been with us for a long time like jay obviously and also newer perspectives and people we ve brought in across different functional areas you know a lot of people have stepped up over this past year as we ve had some transition but it s clear we re better positioned than ever before in terms of the breadth and depth of the team we ve got finally i d say this is a good environment to attract new talent as well we ve built a really strong senior management team it s great to watch how that team continues to evolve as we execute against our strategy operator thank you we would like to request you limit yourself to one question and invite you to join the queue our next question comes from the line of robert lee with kbw please proceed with your question robert lee kbw managing director thanks you touched on capital management i m just curious how do you think of your deal capacity right now within that i understand you want to keep dry powder but have you changed at all how you think about ultimate leverage you re willing to run at if you find the right transaction i guess historically in the past you ve gone three times or more has that changed at all given the environment that there s more a govern around the amount of leverage you d add per transaction jay horgen president and chief financial officer thanks rob let me start here i appreciate the way you asked the question taking a step back our longer term view on our balance sheet is to position it for strength make sure that we are able to execute on our growth opportunities over a cycle we have prudently managed our balance sheet over this time i d say look at the last five years we ve taken leverage down quite a bit that s led to increase in ratings as just a reflection of that leverage coming down but during the same time we ve been committed to returning capital to shareholders and we ve returned 1 billion since the beginning of 2017 as far as capacity let me walk you through that we did just extend our evolve our new five year revolver in january extended our term loan as well so we are well positioned today with leverage in a good place and also enough capacity on a revolver nearly 1 billion on a revolver to execute on our new investment pipeline i think when you look at the capital model over time continuing to limit leverage that we think we can do that while also returning capital to shareholders and we have repurchased shares in each of the last eight quarters with 76 million being repurchased in this past quarter maybe i ll just address that a bit further we met pretty volatile markets in december so we did a bit less than we had initially expected to do in the fourth quarter really because of the extreme volatility in the last two to three weeks of the year and then looking ahead this year we expect to continue to repurchase we mentioned in the prepared remarks 100 million to 300 million in the first half of the year as we also saw we increased our dividend we increased our share authorization so that we could repurchase additional shares throughout the year we have ample capacity under that authorization so taken together we do think we re going to continue to reduce leverage continue to repurchase shares the most important use of our capital is new investment we think that continued tremendous opportunity for us over the long term especially in periods of volatility because after those periods that tends to be times when executing on new investments is most attractive to shareholders nathaniel dalton chief executive officer yeah the only thing i would add to that is i think the question ultimately becomes especially if you re going to do something larger the question becomes when do you have that highest degree of confidence in the opportunities ahead of you i think as jay said we re positioning ourselves to be able to take advantage to deploy capital operator thank you our next question comes from the line of michael carrier with bank of america merrill lynch please proceed with your question shawn bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey guys this is actually shawn on for mike thanks for taking my question given the more challenging industry trends and the increasing need for scale do you see opportunities to centralize more affiliate calls to create some synergy and scale benefits nathaniel dalton chief executive officer let me start with that we talked about on prior calls there are parts of asset management where sales are definitely advantaged and parts of it where it s not i think this is where it s important to understand the unique business model that amg has which is we are able to manage a diverse set of distinctive return streams at effectively enormous scale in this affiliate model that we have the place where we have been investing the place where we have been working with our affiliates is how can you effectively bring that significant scale of diverse distinct return streams to bear which plays into some macro trends as well we talked in our prepared remarks about the consolidation of buyer behavior and centralization so those are places we ve been investing some of that is what we ve been doing with global distribution some of it is things like we announced i think the nordea relationship today some of it is our ability to continue to do things like that which is through a single point of contact make it very efficient for large buyers or large intermediaries to understand all of the return streams our affiliates have and then make it really easy for them to get access the streams they want which could be a product or could be something new but get access to the things they want and then get them into their client portfolios in a way that is both better in terms of faster getting the return streams faster and into the client portfolio but also ultimately done in a way that s a higher margin for us and for them as we make it really efficient for them to both understand the return streams and understand the evolution as well then the final thing i ll say is there s a really good virtuous circle to this which is we learn a lot from these relationships as we ve been going through them which informs not just our product development but also informs our new investment activity as well those are places we re investing we think there s a tremendous opportunity and we re really just at the early stages of that operator thank you our next question comes from the line of chris shutler with william blair please proceed with your question chris shutler william blair analyst hey guys good morning one new investments i know you ve missed out on some deals because of just being prudent around valuation given the scarcity of strong growing asset management firms i m curious to know how you are thinking about valuation in this environment more broadly why are you convinced this business model is still the right one and are you contemplating any kind of changes or moves into adjacencies nathaniel dalton chief executive officer let me start first we think there remains a very significant opportunity with the fundamental approach we have which is how do you partner with these outstanding manufacturing businesses that opportunity is we think still there we also think there s an opportunity to be a much better partner to these firms this goes to some of the kinds of things i was talking about in the prior question which is we think we ve been building capabilities which make us a better partner to those kinds of firms so we think that opportunity is really significant you re right we ve been disciplined but it s not just around pricing we ve been disciplined around a lot of different dimensions we ve been disciplined about the quality of the organizations i think we talked about in an earlier call about what we mean by high quality firms and what are the kinds of firms we think are going to succeed in this environment we ve been disciplined about quality we ve been disciplined about alignment making sure that we really get the long term alignment in a way that can ultimately be multi generational with the management team which we think is important for our model which has a permanent component we talked about so we ve been disciplined about the quality of the firms about the alignment we get with them absolutely we ve been disciplined about pricing but i ll say that s really just been an issue in a subset of the opportunities set in front of us it is an issue in that subset but it s really just an issue in a subset of the opportunity in front of us we continue to look at ways we can extend what we do we think there s such a big opportunity just in collecting these affiliates that have these fantastic returns selecting those as part of amg on our platform and then helping them go into client portfolios more effectively we think that opportunity is a really significant and differentiated opportunity we don t think there is anybody else out there able to prosecute that same opportunity operator thank you our next question comes from the line of alex blostein with goldman sachs please proceed with your question alexander blostein goldman sachs analyst thanks as we re thinking about the baseline management fee eps for you guys obviously there are a lot of moving pieces given the painful end of the year and nice rebound here but it also sounds like you guys are making various corporate investments i heard you were kind of 10 to 20 something performance fees but maybe help us with the baseline management fee run rate jay horgen president and chief financial officer so alex jay i ll make a couple of comments here the first just to put the framing out there we give guidance in a number of areas first this is helping you estimate the run rate aum and ebitda second is just the framework for modeling future growth the third is performance fees on the first run rate aum and ebitda which is directly to your question we started the year with 736 billion in aum our january markets are up and we ve had good flows as well in the retail channel a reversal from the fourth quarter so when you take that together our market blend is up 4 maybe a little over at this point so that gives you a sense for where aum is then as i mentioned in my prepared remarks we re in a range take the midpoint of that range 11 5 of ebtida to average aum and you can get close to what we think is a reasonable ebitda run rate for the first quarter another way to look at it is we gave you what our ebitda would have been before one time items in the fourth quarter of q21 we re off a little bit because the carryover of the fourth quarter being offset by the market and slows in the first quarter so far we re down a couple of percent so think 215 ish on a run rate basis that s another way to get to the same number obviously we go through all the other items to help you translate ebitda down to eps and the guidance as it relates to the framework for modeling future growth i think we see consensus in the street developing a good framework to track that as you know here we ve historically guided people 2 per quarter but that s really up to you i think most everyone knows how to track that then on the third item we talked about performance fees giving you guidance that in the first quarter in that range of ebitda to average aum we do expect 0 10 to 0 20 so at that 11 5 call a midpoint of 0 15 for the first quarter second and third quarter we typically don t have a lot of contracts to crystallize so a step down in those quarters so for the full year as you heard me say we expect a range of 0 75 to 1 75 i ll just comment that again given the uplift in markets new calendar year we ve really improved on our high watermark from last year s performance so we feel pretty good about that performance fee opportunity operator our next question comes from the line of brian bedell with deutsche bank please proceed with your question brian bedell deutsche bank analyst thanks very much jay or nate if you could go a little bit deeper into some of the alternative outflows in the fourth quarter i think you mentioned the delayed funding pipelines if those are actually turning around now in 1q then just on the one time in the fourth quarter if you could parse out the mass general versus the other one time item that you guys took for amg expenses as you think about expenses going forward on the global distribution effort does it make sense to invest more in that given you think you can leverage the good performance across a lot of your strategies going forward nathaniel dalton chief executive officer i ll start we ll try to do that one question in reverse order let me start with the spending point we talked about this a little in our prepared remarks and how we invest in the business if you look back we were pretty decisive in the fourth quarter in terms of we talked about this on earlier calls we ve been looking at this for the last couple quarters which is how do we make sure we re allocating our resources to the right things so we ve reduced spend and we ve clearly reduced resources allocated to product packages all those kinds of things some by us some by affiliates at the same time we ve been investing and increasing spend on the product development side this volatility creates opportunity to build out accelerate product development then as you said a place we have been investing both people and operational build is how do we make sure we get these return streams into the appropriate client portfolios some of that is specifically what we would have referred to as global distribution i think we talked about last quarter for example opening japan where we think there s a very large opportunity very early innings and we continue to see good traction some of our affiliates pantheon aqr have already opened up alongside that some of it is also building against what i ll call kind of channel partnerships or strategic relationships and some of the more complicated mandates we ve talked about on earlier calls is building those resources so that we can get affiliate return streams efficiently into people s portfolio we re absolutely doing that on that part of the question jay horgen president and chief financial officer i just wanted to add on the expenses as you know a large majority of our affiliates are under revenue share but where we do have exposure to expenses at amg and certain equity method affiliates we and they had reduced expenses pretty decisively in the fourth quarter gave rise to about 10 million of one time item sin the fourth quarter we will experience that savings in 19 if we look at where we re exposed to expenses again at amg and at certain of our affiliates we re going to take expenses down 2 to 3 year over year that s already in place the other one time expenses just to keep on that theme obviously mgh the total of mgh and those one time expense management actions has brought our ebitda from 191 to 221 we had a couple of other one time items of course the tax benefits and recovery from ivory as well as the revaluation of systematica those were the four one time items in the quarter if you re tracking that they all go through different financial statement line items so i m happy to follow up with you if you d like on that i think that s on expenses on alternative flows that was us tracking back in reverse order through your question the bridge flows for a moment you did hear me say in the prepared remarks that we did see some pretty significant seasonality which was exacerbated by the december volatility when we took a look at the data we do have pretty good visibility into the institutional book as well as retail seasonality so the institutional the expiration the multi year locks and single year locks and we had about 3 billion to 4 billion of seasonality there with another 4 billion to 5 billion in retail that gets you to that 7 billion to 9 billion number that i mentioned on the call the other factor which is a little harder to assess but i think there s a real number of the risk aversion which was causing lower sales given the extreme markets impacted our flows in that 1 billion to 2 billion number that level so when you take all that away there was still some softness in our flows and that really was alternatives in retail liquid alternatives seasonality and risk aversion exacerbated when we look more broadly over the course of the year we look at first quarter and say in retail we ve got positive flows for january improving performance in us equities a solid illiquid capital raising activity the trends for us remain intact volatility is good for active management and we do broadly speaking have a lot of good performing product across the diverse business we have when you add on to it ample capacity new products starting to gain traction like the systematic fixed income business nate mentioned together with our distribution efforts our evolving partnership with nordea we do think we ll be able to take these distinctive products into new channels new regions new partnerships pulling all that together our long term growth outlook for this year we do expect to return by the end of 2019 to something like 2 organic growth nathaniel dalton chief executive officer the only thing i would add to that is there are a couple of underlying dynamics and jay touched on one which is this balance between the development of products that we believe is distinctive and has good opportunity with the evolution of the book there s a roll off in the book of product that we think is more commoditized or susceptible to being commoditized you did see that over a period of time in some of our us equities in the institutional space as an example some of it is that evolution if you look at the mix of our products we re feeling good about the distinctive nature of an increasing percentage of those products the other dynamic i ll mention is the pullback in the fourth quarter and some of the volatility combined we have a number of products that are fantastic products with a very strong long term track record that have been closed and are reopening and making progress where they re starting to sort out how they re going to put some of the capacity from the fact they ve been closed but also from the standpoint with all this volatility they re seeing real opportunities those are dynamics that i ve put together these are longer term trends those extend beyond this year operator our next question comes from the line of dan fannon with jefferies dan fannon jefferies managing director i first want to clarify positive flows in january versus i think breakeven just clarify that on the retail or maybe that was all in in terms of institutional activity just curious as we see the retail data is retail within the liquid alternatives acting different than the institutional client base or are you seeing broadly institutional demand changing for some of the alternative strategies particularly at aqr jay horgen president and chief financial officer i ll clarify we did see about 100 million positive in the publicly visible clearly that was a significant reversal from december i think nate will pick up on the alternative point here and how it s acting in institutional when you look at the retail flows publicly visible this quarter that s not all of retail dan we do have some advisory and some non reporting retail that s harder for us to see given that it s early february but just commenting on what trends we re seeing in the public that are visible clearly the value managers both the us and global have seen a pretty strong reversal in both investment performance and flows we ve had good flows in us equities one of the themes emerging is where we ve had pretty significant outflows for a significant number of years here in us equities we ve seen really good things in the decreasing of outflows names like yacktman frontier river road have top quartile performance over the long term and we ve seen our us equity kind of three year numbers in aggregate for the first time go above 50 that s probably three or four years since that happened we re very positive about that on global equities we have also seen really good performance especially if the global and international mandates as well as the regional products we ve been plagued a little bit by em performance it s been a tough go for active in em still have great affiliates positioned well in em and some of those affiliates are opening products back up when you look into the data you re seeing international really being driven by that outstanding performance those themes really are emerging here in 2019 and as it relates to liquid alternatives and institutional nathaniel dalton chief executive officer i think 2018 was an extraordinary year in terms of the breadth of the negative returns across asset classes it was sort of historic that was an extraordinary year they underlying theses around why people are trying to get these alternative return streams into their portfolios they all remain intact i think you even see we talked about this in our prepared remarks even with that extraordinary breadth of negative returns across asset classes it really did serve a diversifying effect we look at the decision making in the institutional channel around alternatives and we continue to see very strong sales activity across a wide range of products both liquid and illiquid but certainly in liquid it s not a challenge of that pipeline and sales and opportunities to develop new products and all the rest so that all remains intact i will say there s one other point which is in the retail channel part of what happened was really just the combination of the performance plus the seasonality as people went through whether it was selling ahead of distributions that was part of what we experienced as well even in the institutional channel there was seasonality in institution we think the underlying trends are intact we think there s good activity pipeline it s not acting the same as retail we think those underlying the trends will continue all that said it s ultimately the return streams have to be distinctive and perform jay horgen president and chief financial officer one last thing i didn t want to leave these underlying trends without also mentioning the pe fundraising and illiquid we had a solid quarter a solid year we look forward and we see continued growth in illiquid both the new products and partnerships with large pools of capital you see this as an enduring growth opportunity for us as kind of the other major trend this year nathaniel dalton chief executive officer and a place where there s really good product development going on operator thank you our next question comes from the line of robert lee with kbw please proceed with your question robert lee kbw managing director thanks for taking my follow up if we think of the flows from the quarter kind of characterize that in terms of its ebitda impact if organically it was maybe just on the asset basis just under 2 would the ebitda impact be kind of similar or is there some mix issue that would make it greater or lower if we think jay kind of thinking that can get back to the 2 organic growth by the end of 19 given how you re looking at the mix going forward from what you can see would that be indicative of the ebitda contribution jay horgen president and chief financial officer let s take the ebitda contribution first the asset weighted ebitda contribution is a little hard to see in the underlying data because performance fees had such an impact on our results in the fourth quarter one of the things you can see as i mentioned if you kind of track ebitda from third to fourth to first quarter i mentioned the 221 for one time items in the fourth quarter going to something that looks like 215 that s just a couple of percent down the way you can also see that s tracking that was consistent with your inference that s tracking to when you look at average ebitda to average aum it s actually going up what that suggests it the assets that were lost had an average weighting that was consistent with our overall business and the mix shift for us is actually going back the other way after several quarters rather than going the reverse direction so i would say that i think that s partly because of where we re growing and it s also partly based upon the ownership mix of our business operator thank you ladies and gentlemen that concludes our time for questions i ll turn the floor back to mr dalton for any final comments nathaniel dalton chief executive officer thank you all again for joining us this morning as you heard we are confident in our prospects for significant long term growth we ve built a diverse business which includes some of the highest quality boutique firms in the industry with established long term track records of outperformance across a wide range of investment strategies as jay said all this is within a business model that has low operating leverage and a flexible capital structure that positions us to execute on our business strategy and create long term value for shareholders we look forward to speaking with you next

by kate duguid new york reuters while stocks hog the limelight with their best january in three decades another corner of the risk assets marketplace sprang back to life last month after having taken a pounding at the end of last year though some investors question whether the recovery has legs junk bonds in january delivered their strongest monthly performance in more than seven years with a total return of nearly 4 6 percent according to ice bofaml index data retracing almost all of the fourth quarter s losses issuance of new debt rebounded after a near complete shutdown in december for a graphic on junk bonds roared back to life in january click along with the surge in stocks it would appear to be an endorsement of a u s economy that continues to outperform its global peers as well as the shift by the federal reserve to a wait and see posture regarding future interest rate increases companies with risky credit profiles brought 11 7 billion in new high yield debt to the market in the first month of the year after a nearly six week dry spell at the end of 2018 the bounce back from december has led fund investors to put the most cash into high yield bonds since 2016 according to lipper that backdrop would typically be seen as constructive for more gains some big bond managers however remain skeptical of the rebound attributing it more to a clutch of technical factors that will soon peter out than to a lasting improvement in fundamentals we don t think this is a particularly strong buying opportunity said john mcclain portfolio manager at diamond hill capital anticipating a market correction that will pull prices lower strong high yield gains in january 2018 were more than erased by a volatile february december saw just 594 million in high yield deals the lowest monthly issuance since august 2008 companies stepped back from raising debt because global macroeconomic trends such as slowing global growth the u s china trade war and brexit had whipped up volatility in financial markets but when fed chairman jerome powell last month signaled a pause in the u s central bank s interest rate hiking policy confirmed in last week s policy statement markets rebounded still the high yield market s recovery from the december trough adds up to less than half of january 2018 s issuance the relatively small size of the market may be artificially buoying

we re going to have trade wars the economy is slowing the fed s going to raise rates and that s going to ruin everything this january he said nobody cares given the persistence of those macroeconomic themes the volatility that spooked high yield issuers in december could easily return in 2019 and although the fed may be open to pause interest rate hikes this year the continued strength of the u s labor market may make it difficult for the fed to justify holding rates unchanged for too long the market reaction to the fed s dovishness is overblown economic fundamentals have not changed and the fed could raise again after a pause said gaffney for managers skeptical of the rebound in junk then january provided an opportunity to remove risk ahead of anticipated volatility we ve used the first

global trade tensions are scaring investors globally in asia despite the huge needs to finance large projects the asian infrastructure investment bank aiib is concerned about stagnant and even fall of private capital being attracted its vice president told euractiv com joachim von amsberg is a german economist and banker he is vice president for policy and strategy at the aiib prior to his appointment he was vice president of the world bank joachim von amsberg spoke with euractiv s jorge valero your last report noted that there hasn t been a significant breakthrough in mobilising private sector funds are you disappointed with the results we see a huge opportunity in bringing private capital to finance infrastructure in asia the extent to which these investments have been realised is a disappointment the report shows that the market we look at in aggregate the volume is still quite modest and it is not increasing it is stagnant or even declining we see that with concern and as a big untapped opportunity what is the reason for this decline in a nutshell it is a full spectrum of challenges to bring private financing to the market and close the transaction starting with macroeconomic uncertainty regulatory and institutional weaknesses rule of law issues market knowledge or structuring the financial product there is no silver bullet to solve all these issues you need to address them at the same time which is difficult asian investment bank we could invest in the eu the asian infrastructure investment bank aiib has recently decided to start looking abroad to invest its 100 billion in capital including ports in the eu his vice president joachim von amsberg told euractiv there wouldn t be any rivalry with eu institutions but rather collaboration what are the investment needs in the region we have committed 7 5 billion in 35 projects over the past three years that s a lot of money for startups but very little money for the financial needs of the market we cannot be satisfied alone with the deployment of our resources some studies point to 1 7 trillion a year in asia in terms of aggregate infrastructure financing needs i don t think we have seen a good estimate of how much of that could actually be financed from the private sector your report mentions tensions and rising nationalism as having an impact in investment have you noticed any reluctance to work with aiib in the region given the weight of china inside the bank there are two trends that concern us as worsening conditions one is the expectation of continuous rise in long term interest rates that will make hard for us to finance marginal projects but probably for large scale projects is not decisive because 100 basis points higher in long term rates is a big hit in many development projects but it is not the critical factor another trend is the trade tensions investment in trade related infrastructures transport infrastructure or manufacturing facilities for trade investment may slow down if the universal support for free trade is put into question investors could think twice before putting resources into a port or a trade related infrastructure conditions are maybe a bit more difficult and yet the need continues to be overwhelming there is a general feeling that this is no longer a trade war between the us and china but an economic one do you feel any pressure on the bank as part of these tensions you are rightly pointing out that there is a politicisation of the economic policy as a multilateral development bank we have a very well established multilateral governance we have 93 approved members from 67 founding members the decisions are taken in consultation in broad consensus among the members quite the opposite from instruments that could be politicised the fact that aiib was created on the initiative of china i think that makes multilateral cooperation more robust because it shows that different countries can take the lead and yet create robust multilateral institutions looking back one of our great achievements is that we have created that multilateral framework and now is very well established how decisions are taken it has created a trust that has made other countries to join us frets as major eu powers join new china led world bank the united states has urged countries to think twice before signing up to a new china led asian development bank that washington sees as a rival to the world bank after germany france and italy followed britain in saying they would join china is not only embroiled in a trade war with the us the eu has complained at the world trade organisation about china s ip practices have these developments impacted the functioning of the bank the issues you are referring to concern me because they affect our member countries i am worried about the effects of this dispute and politicisation on the economic development of our member countries i am not so much worried about the impact on the aiib firstly because our multilateral governance is very firmly legally enshrined and has worked very well and secondly we face very strong demand from countries for our financing services if anything the politicisation of the environment will lead to more demand from our multilateral financing because it provides protection when you finance through a multilateral bank you have international standards and decision making which is multilateral rather than bilateral over the past three years observers have become to understand the difference between a chinese project and a chinese bank on one hand and multilateral financing from a multilateral development bank in which china happens to be the largest shareholder and initiator these are two very different universes we explained it again and again and people see how we act what is your expected demand for this year we expect that we will scale up our financing to around four billion dollars this year which is large for a start up organisation but very modest compared to the needs so we will put increasing emphasis on instruments that mobilise other capital for example by providing guarantees

instruments under the banner of a new fund called investeu which will formally succeed the juncker plan

chairman president and chief executive officer tom bene thomas l bene president chief executive officer and director good morning everyone and thank you as always for joining us i would like to start this morning with some key themes that drove our results for the quarter along with some comments on the current macro environment that we re operating in followed by a discussion of recent organizational changes then continuing with our us foodservice operations business results and concluding with a discussion of our international and other business segments joel will then discuss the financial results in more detail for the second quarter we saw improved year over year top line results and are continuing to execute on our strategic priorities designed to improve our overall performance our focus for the quarter was led by our efforts to enrich the customer s experience of doing business with sysco and to consistently provide excellent service to help our customers be successful we remain committed to achieving our three year planned financial objectives although the manner in which we achieve them may look slightly different than what we originally outlined joel will discuss this further in just a few moments our results for the second quarter include a sales increase of 2 5 to 14 8 billion gross profit growth of 2 7 to 2 8 billion and adjusted operating expense growth of 2 1 which delivered adjusted operating income increase of 4 8 to 603 3 million and an adjusted earnings per share decrease of 0 03 per share to 0 75 local case volume was solid within us broadline operations growing 3 3 of which 2 4 was organic total case volume within us broadline grew 2 9 of which 2 was organic with local growth outpacing national this quarter as previously discussed we expected overall softer volume this quarter due to lapping of the hfm acquisition and the lapping of two large national customers looking at broader economic and industry trends and as we think about the key drivers in the foodservice and the segments in which we operate there are a number of factors which are important for the overall macro environment including consumer confidence and discretionary spending even with the recent and somewhat volatile financial markets we continue to see us consumer confidence remaining fairly strong driven by the solid labor market with unemployment remaining low at 3 9 as of december which is normally a good indicator of that higher consumer confidence in the restaurant industry we continue to see sales growth particularly in same store sales where traffic continues to be mixed and lastly from an international economic outlook perspective it s mixed where we do business in the uk the consumer is still dealing with uncertainty and concerns over brexit next steps however this is balanced with some strength in other geographies and generally speaking we are seeing decent consumer spending and overall industry trends in the other international markets where we do business turning to the topic of m a m a continues to be an important part of our strategy for growth last week two new acquisitions were made public one in the us waugh foods and one in ireland classic drinks so these are examples of smaller transactions especially compared to the size of total sysco these acquisitions are great examples of our m a strategy waugh foods is a central illinois distributor with the overwhelming majority of its business with independent restaurants and classic drinks is an established specialized wine and spirits distributor which will further strengthen our existing product portfolio in our ireland business i d like to now transition to some organizational and leadership changes that we recently announced in order to drive continued growth and to create value for all sysco stakeholders we implemented organizational and executive leadership changes which will further align the company with its customer first operating model and streamline the business these changes will help us increase agility reduce costs and accelerate decision making across the business by getting closer to our customers and better aligning our resources to support and address their evolving needs additionally this reorganization results in an approximate 10 reduction in salary and corporate support positions and while any decision which impacts our associates is a difficult one this is an essential step to realign the organization and sharpen our focus on the company s key strategies to enable growth now i d like to transition to our second quarter results by business segment beginning with us foodservice operations sales for the second quarter were 10 1 billion an increase of 4 2 gross profit grew 4 5 operating expenses grew 4 7 and operating income increased 4 2 inflation during the first two months of the quarter remained relatively flat but increased toward the end of the quarter contributing to the total gross profit dollar growth overall gross profit growth was also positively impacted by an increase in case growth a reduction in spot market usage of inbound freight continued growth in sysco brand which was up 59 basis points in our local segment versus prior year benefiting from our ongoing category management initiatives and our cutting edge solutions innovation platform our cutting edge solutions continue to provide value added products for our customers we are excited about our next launch of these innovative new products that will be taking place in a couple of weeks which we also believe could be our best yet also of note we continue to see an increase in the utilization of our digital ordering platform which has improved over 50 of local cases ordered additionally we continue to make progress on improving our customer facing tools including a refreshed delivery app and improvements to our digital shopping platform from an expense perspective operating expenses grew for the quarter driven primarily by continued supply chain cost increases in both the warehouse and transportation areas while we have seen increased cost in these areas in recent quarters we continue to remain focused on better managing and mitigating these costs as an example we continue to focus on specialized recruiting training and onboarding efforts and we are starting to see an improvement in retention especially in the warehouse moving onto our international foodservice operations for the quarter sales increased 0 8 gross profit decreased 1 6 adjusted operating expenses decreased by 2 6 and adjusted operating income grew 5 1 in our international segment from a top line perspective we saw improved performance in canada with strong sales growth year over year despite some softness in alberta in the uk top line performance for the quarter was impacted by continued uncertainty surrounding brexit and our business in france was impacted by the yellow vest protest during the critical holiday time frame from a cost perspective in our international segment we had some supply chain challenges in the uk as we onboarded several new customers to the business in ireland the team continues to execute strongly against their integration initiatives and as a result synergies from the merger of brakes ireland and pallas are ahead of schedule our integration of brake france and davigel into sysco france is not only progressing well but we launched our new sysco france brand to the french market last week at the sirha world hospitality and foodservice event in lyon this is an important step to building on our position as a leading european foodservice provider as we ve also discussed in europe we have accelerated the investments we are making related to our long term strategic growth plans which are designed to enrich the customer experience and position us well in these markets joe will discuss this point further in a moment and its impact to our certain items this quarter moving on to sygma performance for the quarter was down as we continue to optimize our business in this industry segment and we remain focused on improving our overall operational performance we expect to see continued softness in the top line as we make disciplined choices in an effort to improve profitability for the long term and lastly in our other business segment guest supply had strong top line performance during the quarter with increased sales of 8 3 and increased gross profit of 5 2 so cost continue to be a challenge due to the continued impact of tariffs product availability and the increased cost of shipping products to our customers overall we are pleased with our performance in the hospitality segment and remain excited about the long term potential for this business in summary overall the fundamentals in our industry and in our business remain solid we plan to continue to deliver against our strategic priorities to provide an improved customer experience excellent customer service and strong operating performance and finally i d like to thank our dedicated associates across the company for all of their efforts to make sysco the distributor of choice for our customers and the leader in the foodservice industry now i ll turn the call over to joel grade our chief financial officer joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you tom good morning everyone i d like to provide you with additional financial details surrounding our performance for the quarter as tom noted for the second quarter for total sysco sales were 14 8 billion an increase of 2 5 compared to the same period last year changes in foreign exchange rates decreased sales by 0 7 gross profit in the second quarter increased 2 7 and gross margin increased 4 basis points during the quarter particularly in december in our us broadline business we experienced 1 4 inflation driven by a few categories primarily frozen potato meat paper and produce adjusted operating expenses for total sysco were up 2 1 for the quarter with regard to the leverage of operating expense growth to gross profit dollar growth our performance was in line with our expectations while we did improve performance compared to the first quarter of this fiscal year we remain focused on improving this trend in the third quarter the second half of the year and for the remainder of the three year plan total adjusted operating income was 603 3 million in the quarter an increase of 4 8 compared to the same period last year changes in foreign exchange rates decreased adjusted operating income by 48 basis points we previously discussed transformative initiatives that we have in place which will allow us to continue to grow our business and capitalize on our strong fundamentals as we continue to evolve as a company we are placing further emphasis on the holistic assessment of our work in order to effectively centralize and standardize our business including by leveraging technology and strengthening sysco overall we will continue to focus on strong implementation and execution while accelerating some of this work all of which provides us with the confidence to achieve our financial objectives as a reminder we are expecting to see increased cost savings benefit from these initiatives in the second half of this fiscal year some of these initiatives include first our finance transformation roadmap this important work is about modernizing our global financial platform starting mostly within our us operations we are centralizing activities automating work and working with offshore partners where the transactional work can be done more efficiently and cost effectively changes have begun and we expect to see the benefits in the second half of this fiscal year the second area of focus is our smart spending initiatives here we take a detailed and accelerated view of indirect spending categories to identify and execute on cost reductions in these areas again we anticipate benefits being realized in the second half of the fiscal year in our canadian regionalization this work is about optimizing the leadership and overall structure of our canadian business which historically has been highly decentralized we have good opportunities here and feel great about the progress we ve made thus far and finally regarding overall administrative expenses we continue to aggressively look for new and innovative ways to drive cost out of the business which align with our transformative efforts to drive growth areas that are not only in line with our three year plan objectives but also either accelerate some initiatives or are incremental to the original plan an example of it would be the changes we discussed earlier regarding the new streamlined organizational and business unit structure turning to earnings per share our adjusted eps for the quarter decreased 0 03 to 0 75 per share our eps results this quarter were impacted by our tax rate as a reminder in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 we saw retroactive benefit back to the beginning of our fiscal year in fy18 due to the adoption of reduced tax rates in us while us tax rates are lower in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 the retroactive benefit created a larger benefit in the second quarter of our fiscal 2018 as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019 our eps results this quarter were also impacted by increased interest expense which was higher than the same period last year due to variable rate changes and less stock option exercises than in the prior year i d also like to remind you that we anticipate our effective tax rate for this fiscal year to be 25 i would like to take a minute now to talk about why we had a large amount of certain items this quarter we continue making investments in our business related to our strategic plans designed to position us for long term growth our certain items in the second quarter are primarily related to these initiatives including the integration of our businesses in france and ireland european multi temperature investments our finance transformation roadmap and canadian regionalization the largest in the certain items is related to the restructuring of our france business which included significant severance as we ve discussed with the france restructuring we are integrating our brake france and davigel businesses into sysco france the merger of these two businesses will position us well for continued success in the french marketplace and we expect to see benefit from this initiative in our france business beginning in fiscal 2020 additionally as we have stated we anticipate seeing benefit from our finance transformation roadmap and canadian regionalization initiatives in the second half of this fiscal year now turning to cash flow cash flow from operations was 917 8 million for the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2019 which was 15 4 million lower compared to the prior year period free cash flow for the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2019 was 700 9 million which was 22 4 million higher compared to the prior year the improvement in free cash flow was due primarily to continued improvements in payables and receivables as a reminder in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 we deferred cash tax payments due to flood relief associated with hurricane harvey so this is impacting our year over year comparison net capital expenditures totaled 216 9 million for the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2019 which was 37 8 million lower compared to the prior year period in summary we saw improved results for the second quarter and we remain focused on supporting our customers and executing our business initiatives to achieve our objectives at this point we re halfway through our three year plan and have increased adjusted operating income by 241 million we are committed to achieving our goals and as always we are committed to performing consistently on a high level to achieve customer satisfaction and solidify our industry leading position operator we are now ready for q a questions and answers operator operator instructions your first question is from the line of karen short with barclays karen short barclays capital analyst hi thanks just to clarify a couple of things so as we look at the percent of savings coming from gross profit dollars versus opex it does seem that it will be much more skewed to opex now with these layoffs can you maybe just give an update on how to think about that joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes hi karen it s joel i would say it s somewhat more than we kind of i wouldn t call it dramatically more but again just when you think about the first half of this three year plan for the most part we ve had relatively flat levels of inflation certainly some of the challenges we ve had in supply chain so i guess i would just say that some of them there is a bit more emphasis on some of the administrative cost reductions but again as we ve seen little bit of inflation returning and certainly it gives obviously continue to work to mitigate some of the challenges on the supply chain side again i would say somewhat more focused but again i wouldn t say we re really dramatically shifting as we talked about earlier thomas l bene president chief executive officer and director and karen i might just add i mean i think if you think about it as we really have two big buckets you had gross profit and you had cost and what we re really talking about and what we ve been sharing is that our supply chain costs have been higher over the last few quarters so we re having to balance that still on the cost side so it s kind of cost and gross profit isn t the big shift it s really more between some of the cost buckets that we re really focusing on karen short barclays capital analyst okay but just for modeling purposes to clarify when i look at the corporate number it s fair to say that that only included the benefit of the corporate layer the supply chain supply sorry shared services for one month out of the three in the quarter right so going forward as we model corporate that number should be quite a bit lower joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so it would not have included any of that at this point so there will be some impact on corporate expenses when we forecast karen short barclays capital analyst okay and then just my follow up is i was curious if local organic case growth internally was in line with plan and i know you said that kind of quarter wasn t general but i m only asking because you actually got no longer have a slide highlighting case growth and you guys have kind of had that slide in the past so any color on that would be great joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer let s look back at that slide i m not sure about that but as far as the local case growth i think we feel really good about the case growth i think there was a little bit of choppiness in the quarter it kind of came back a little stronger toward the end which is we feel good about but i would say it was maybe a little less than we had planned but not dramatically different karen short barclays capital analyst great thanks operator your next question is from the line of john heinbockel with guggenheim securities john heinbockel guggenheim analyst hey guys tom maybe a quick question could you maybe walk through some of the changes you ve made here on the organizational side they sound more operational so what happened in terms of chain of command span of control and layers of management how do you go to market differently because of this and then how do you guard against any adverse impact on your customer thomas l bene president chief executive officer and director great question john thanks so let s start with the changes we made were in fact around kind of streamlining the business and when you think about spans and layers was the key focus very focused in corporate and so when you think about impact to our customers or to our selling organization or to our growth plans little to none i mean that s not where the focus was this is really about how do we kind of improve the kind of the agility of this organization our ability to make decisions more quickly and so it was heavily focused on corporate office and as you probably saw or heard there was a couple of changes with my leadership team so the headline here is mostly a kind of a spans and layers exercise in areas where we felt like we could remove some cost and maybe some redundancy and candidly get us more focused on the key priorities we ve got and that we ve outlined to you all from a leadership perspective there are a couple of changes that are probably worth highlighting one is that we ve been going through some work within our technology area we ve got kind of an innovation technology group and we ve got a core traditional technology group and we re looking at how we bring those two organizations closer together and we ve been doing some work around that and as we continue that work we will continue to make some adjustments and so what you saw there was a change taking place within the kind of traditional it area the great news for us is we ve got a deep bench here we feel very good about the team we ve got and the work we re doing and so i don t think you should expect and we certainly don t expect to miss a beat with our technology efforts the other thing is there were some think about it in this administration area we had a role that was kind of administrative role there was a combination of a lot of other things that as a company we have tucked under that role over the last couple of years think about csr think about even some of our communications work and so we felt like it was an opportunity here to streamline that work and that organization and so we obviously replaced the important part of that role which was the chief legal officer and we ve promoted a talented woman named eve mcfadden here at sysco who is now our new chief legal officer and corporate secretary and so again really no impact there i think from an overall business perspective or certainly from any of our customers or our strategic focus and so those are probably the largest changes that are worth highlighting joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes and if i could just add one thing i mean just to reiterate something tom said john none of these were cost changes that were in any way inconsistent we re not seeing costs out that are actually supporting growth so i think this that s really an important point here that there s work being done to streamline and taking the connection between our customers and ourselves but this is certainly nothing done that s going to impact growth john heinbockel guggenheim analyst and then one last thing if you as you look at the step up in inflation rate you saw in december and it s not clear if that s going to continue but let s assume it does how do you feel about pass through right now right relative to all the other cost pressures your customers are seeing maybe compared to the past do you think you can pass it through as you have in the past or maybe it s a little more challenging thomas l bene president chief executive officer and director yes i don t think we ve seen really a big change there i think look as we ve always said too much inflation is hard to pass through but as long as it remains at kind of this modest level i think we still feel very good about our ability to do that clearly we ve got lots of tools in our tool belt here including sysco brand which we continue to talk a lot about but it s driving really good performance i think it was 59 basis points we talked about this quarter and again we ve kind of seen that ongoing benefit that we get for sysco brand and that helps our customers a lot it generally provides them some value and obviously it s good for us as well john heinbockel guggenheim analyst okay thank you operator your next question is from the line of vincent sinisi with morgan stanley vinnie sinisi morgan stanley analyst hey great thanks very much for taking my question guys just wanted to follow up on the headcount reductions can you just kind of give us maybe a little bit more color on how does that fit into kind of the grand scheme of the cost cutting initiatives especially as we go through the next couple of years here is it fair to say that that s kind of the largest bucket among them and other ones that might be worth noting in terms of progress thomas l bene president chief executive officer and director so let me start and i ll let joel talk here too and i think it s important to go back to the things we ve been consistently talking about so certainly cost is an important part of us delivering the three year plan and as we ve continued to talk i mean the balance of that cost may be slightly different than we initially had talked about primarily between the supply chain area because that area has been increasing and the administrative cost side but this recent action is really about maintaining the focus that we talked about on cost broadly yes it was focused on administrative side of this but i wouldn t say that this is a large part of the overall when you think about the plans we had over the three years all of these areas need to work together and this is just one piece of that overall puzzle in addition to the big buckets that joel also has mentioned numerous times so with that i ll let joel kind of build on that joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i think the only thing i d add vinnie in this is just we ve talked about the fact that we ve had some of these initiatives that we have that were some multi year in scope and in some cases some benefits were being able to be accelerated on those and then in some cases there were also things that we looked at that were outside of the main scope of those and this would be one of those things and so in other words as we sort of thought about some of the things we ve talked about at our overall cost discussions this will be one of those things that will be incremental to that and so anyway that s the way i would think about it and again just again as a reminder there s obviously still a very large part of this benefit that we re looking to get from our gross profit dollar growth as well so i mean this is this i still consider it as a very balanced approach with just some further acceleration of these things i think and some of these things like this that were incremental to the additional plans that we laid out vinnie sinisi morgan stanley analyst okay that s helpful guys thank you and then maybe just a quick follow up tom i think you said in your prepared remarks that you had a reduction in spot market usage can you guys just give us a quick update on transportation freight cost kind of where you are on a sequential basis and how you are able to be better managing through thomas l bene president chief executive officer and director yes think about that comment very specific to inbound freight and if you think about a year ago when we really hit i think in this quarter it had a big increase in that spot market utilization because of the tight market yet and everyone was scrambling we got like probably everybody we got kind of pushed to the spot market we ve just done as we ve talked for the last really four quarters a much better job of managing that and so as we went into this year it s that overlap that i m really referring to that was down so i think we talked about this last quarter i d say the inbound freight is kind of the new normal it s higher than it was certainly a year ago kind of spread out over a year but year over year for the quarter we saw some benefit just because that s when we took the biggest impact last year vinnie sinisi morgan stanley analyst got it all right that s super helpful thanks very much guys good luck thomas l bene president chief executive officer and director thanks operator your next question is from the line of judah frommer with credit suisse judah frommer credit suisse analyst hi thanks for taking the question guys maybe first just on the independent case growth commentary i think it s been a while that you ve been talking about same store sales being flattish to positive and traffic being more mixed i mean kind of at what point do you get concerned about the trajectory of that independent business and can you talk about those very small one and two store independents versus the chains that you ve been talking about more recently thomas l bene president chief executive officer and director yes good morning judah i think we continue to feel good about the mix of our business we ve talked over the last couple of quarters about this kind of regional chains or these kind of micro chains that are growing and that continues and i think we still feel good about our position there because of the value proposition that we have for those customers when you think about the true independents the ones you re talking about these kind of one and two unit kind of operators look we continue to see as we ve said a decent growth there now it s very much driven by the outlet and the type of business that they are running and the experience they are providing but generally speaking we still feel good about that so i think there and as you ve heard us talk a lot and i won t overdo it on that this market is still very fragmented so the acquisitions were good example even while waugh is a fairly small acquisition relative to sysco s size it s a great example of where there are a lot of really good regional distributors out there who are still doing good business and are a good fit and so those guys are heavily independent driven and it s a great example of how we can leverage some great work in a great organization that they have with sysco and the capabilities we bring so long winded way of saying look i think we still feel really good about our position our growth and certainly our prospects given the marketplace that we operate in judah frommer credit suisse analyst okay great and then maybe just quickly if we kind of rewind to q1 i would say there was some combination of warehouse labor pressure and flattish inflation causing some consternation on your part of that hitting the midpoint of 2020 guidance would be tougher against that backdrop would you say that we fast forward to q2 and kind of the exit rates there that with kind of the offsets in operating expense and inflation kind of reramping that you do feel better about those 2020 targets than you did three and a half months ago thomas l bene president chief executive officer and director well i think we felt good about the 2020 targets all along so i think what we ve talked about is some shifting of how we might deliver that but we have consistently said we feel good about our ability to deliver this three year plan and we still feel very comfortable about that joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes judah i think we just we called out a couple of things that we ve said are causing us to continue to accelerate some other things because we re simply not just sitting on our laurels and saying inflation is low in the supply chain side but obviously we re going after some of that stuff but i think we ve been pretty consistent in saying in expressing our confidence in achieving our target judah frommer credit suisse analyst great thanks operator your next question is from the line of marisa sullivan with bank of america marisa sullivan bank of america analyst good morning thanks for taking my question i wanted to ask about cost savings as some of the initiatives that you ve talked about kind of roll in and kick in the back half do you think that you ll get back to that longer term 150 basis point gap between gross profit dollar and opex growth in 3q or is that more of a will that take more time to get you back to that long term level joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer hey marisa this is joel yes so the way i would think about that obviously we don t give that type of quarterly guidance but what i would say is that again as we continue to express confidence in achieving our three year targets and as mathematically would be necessary in order to get back to or exceed that rate over the next six quarters i would think about it that way again we ve talked about the fact that our second half of this fiscal year we believe will ramp in some of those areas including that gap so again we re not giving specific guidance i would just tell you that we continue to express that confidence and again i d say mathematically that would certainly have to be the case over the course of those six quarters marisa sullivan bank of america analyst got you and then on the corporate reductions that you announced this morning when did they kick in how quickly did they roll on to the p l and is there more room to go and do you have to kind of find more incremental pockets to get you maybe back to that mid to higher end of the ebit improvement range joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer so why don t i start here i mean so i think the question when this will start to kick in that will be in the third quarter and so you ll start to see some of those benefits in q3 and again over the second half of the fiscal year i guess the other thing i would say and again certainly tom could chime in here we re always continually looking for ways to do this again we often get asked hey we ve got these sort of key initiatives we ve laid out are there other things you re doing and again that s our job to always look for different opportunities and so we ll certainly continue to do that but hopefully that gives you some clarity on the timing thomas l bene president chief executive officer and director yes marisa i think that s well said i mean i think anytime you take an action like this it s difficult for the associates involved and we take that very seriously here but i think at the same time it is our responsibility to be constantly looking for ways to optimize this business and improve the overall experience our customers have with doing business with us and we re going to continue to do that as an organization and we ll have to time will tell whether or not some of those things need to be accelerated or not but we feel really good about the plans we have in place right now joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes and i think the only thing i ve just again not to sound like a broken record here but again these are not again we are not taking costs out of things that are actually facilitating growth in our company and so i think that s just really important we continue to invest in this company we continue to ensure that we re investing in the right places to grow and we also continue to look for opportunities to streamline i just think it s important to make sure that message is loud and clear marisa sullivan bank of america analyst thanks that s super helpful operator your next question is from the line of kelly bania with bmo capital kelly bania bmo capital markets analyst hi good morning thanks for taking my questions just going back to the workforce reduction i guess two questions one can you just talk about the size of the impact of the impact of that on a dollar standpoint on an annualized basis and then just to clarify was this always part of the three year plan or was there any change into the size of the structure of it or was it just pulled forward in terms of timing relative to your original expectations thomas l bene president chief executive officer and director hey kelly thanks for the question yes so no this first of all couple of things on that we haven t actually given the dollar amount the dollar magnitude of that we did talk about sort of 10 of positions in corporate support but we have not given that dollar amount the question and so again as i mentioned in my remarks this i would characterize this as one of those things that are incremental to some of the stuff that we actually talked about as part of our plan this would fall into one of those categories we often get the question hey what else are you guys doing this would be one of those things and so this would not have fallen into one of the things we ve talked about specifically at our investor day or key initiatives we often talk about kelly bania bmo capital markets analyst okay perfect and then in terms of the inflation it sounded like that started really in the latter part of the quarter just curious if that has continued into january and what maybe you re expecting for the back half in terms of inflation in your plan joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i would say kelly at this point that that has continued and i think our expectation is i d call modest levels of inflation here over to the next couple of quarters kelly bania bmo capital markets analyst okay great and maybe just a bigger picture one then as you look at your competitive set obviously the big three have about a third of the share but just curious what you re seeing from that other two thirds and those regional distributors you talked about some of them performing well with independents or catering to the independents well but are you seeing any changes in behavior or strategy with those group of distributors that we don t really get to hear from on a regular basis thomas l bene president chief executive officer and director hey kelly it s tom no i don t think we really i mean it remains very competitive obviously out there and when we we ve talked about this a fair amount but as you know the big kind of the public three well that s very visible to everyone there are very good and very capable regional distributors in this business and many of them but there are some fairly large ones as well on a regional basis that we all compete with and i would say that they have always been good competition and they continue to be but i don t think we ve seen anything kind of new or different from them or that s dramatically changed so highly competitive but there are certainly a lot of good companies out there in this industry kelly bania bmo capital markets analyst thanks operator your next question is from the line of karen holthouse with goldman sachs karen holthouse goldman sachs analyst hi thanks for taking the question just on the inflation commentary so it was pretty flat in the first two months and then you ended up a little bit ahead of 1 for the quarter really just driven by december would that just the math would imply that you were running north of 4 probably in december is that the right way to think about it and is that how to think about a run rate into the third quarter or were there really some part to that that you would view as more temporary thanks joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so karen it s joel we first of all i d say we re slightly inflationary over the again over the first couple months so i wouldn t say we re flat and the math for us doesn t apply 4 over the december so it certainly implies some acceleration in december as i mentioned some of that some inflation again i d say it s carried over into the third quarter and we anticipate again modest levels of inflation as we head into the second half of the year but i would not anticipate 4 inflation heading into the second half of the year karen holthouse goldman sachs analyst okay thank you operator your next question is from the line of john ivankoe with jpmorgan john ivankoe jpmorgan analyst hi thank you first i wanted to get back to some of the prepared remarks about the industry which i think we are discussing the expectation of same store sales growth but traffic being mixed can you elaborate on what sectors that you are seeing in terms of that aren t participating in this overall economic growth and maybe how you re positioning toward the better sectors and less toward the slower or even negative sectors might be changing over the next couple of years and then i ll have a follow up as well thomas l bene president chief executive officer and director sure i mean if you think about we ve talked a lot about the various sectors over the years and if you think about the restaurants obviously being the largest segment of this industry and of the market let s start there but i think when we talk about the traffic and the spend it s highly variable so if you think about it from a npd perspective the total traffic during the last during this last time frame was basically up slightly and the spend was up about 3 qsr was driving the majority of that mid scale they call mid scale dining traffic was down about 2 and spend was up about 1 and then casual was also traffic was down and the spend was up so it s kind of mixed if you think about the various segments within restaurant as we ve also talked a lot about though we participate in lots of different segments we continue to see growth opportunities in places like healthcare and certainly education retail sector continues to be a growing foodservice segment so there continues to be lots of areas of growth out there and we ve also talked and it s been a focus for us for a few years now but it continues to be the ethnic segments within restaurants continue to see growth and depending on that s somewhat maybe more a little more geographic based but we see solid growth in certain ethnic segments as well john ivankoe jpmorgan analyst okay helpful i wanted to see if there was maybe a change of tone in any way regarding your comments and it sounds like it s more consistent the next question if i can sneak another one in before the final one digital ordering now at 50 of local case growth order that would suggest maybe we re at some type of a tipping point obviously the marketing associates are doing less ordering and they re doing a lot more servicing or adding value to their customers could you remind us whether we re now at the point where the level of marketing associates is relatively stable despite the expectation of local case growth where maybe we can get to a point where the best marketing associates can serve more clients and just be more overall profit additive to the corporation thomas l bene president chief executive officer and director sure john it s a good question so we ve actually been over 50 for a few quarters now but we have kind of hit this it is a i think it s an important question because it s a good percentage of our business that is online and remember this is the local business we re talking about our national or contract business a lot higher portion of that is actually done online or through things like edi but within this local segment about the same time a year ago we also talked about we were adding some marketing associates we ve kind of gotten through that addition and we felt like that was real important at the time because we had now had some tools available to us that were enabling us to target where those resources could go think about that as where we had some bigger maybe share gaps or share opportunities and once we ve identified that we wanted to make sure we were focused there as we think about it today given that percentage of ordering given some of the additional tools we continue to provide our customers and our organization i do think we re at a place where we re somewhat stable from a selling resource perspective we are seeing larger territories we think that s a good thing but we aren t looking at this as a way to dramatically reduce or change our selling resources we continue to believe they are a very very important part of our model and we know from our customer feedback that they are highly valued so it s really about continuing to give them more tools to help them be more effective and obviously more consultative but also making sure that our customers have the opportunity to do business with us the way they want to which has been also our focus in our model john ivankoe jpmorgan analyst great thank you for that and then the final question the acquisition of wine excuse me of classic drinks which does wine and spirits in ireland is that that segment is that a one off for you obviously the us has especially even on a per state basis has a lot of unique challenges in terms of wine and spirits distribution but is that a unique to ireland type of business segment for you or might there be other types of applications in your geographies around the world and that type of segment thomas l bene president chief executive officer and director i would say it s a little more unique to ireland there may be some more parts of europe in ireland we had a small we sold a small amount of wine and spirits in that market in particular the competitive set wine and spirits is a big part of the competitive set so the classic drinks acquisition really puts us in a great spot to compete more broadly in that overall market and so i d say it is a little more unique they don t have nearly the kind of the state by state laws that we have here in the us and so it s i d say at this point think about it as something that s appropriate for that market but not something that is a strategic shift for sysco john ivankoe jpmorgan analyst thank you operator your next question is from the line of edward kelly with wells fargo edward kelly wells fargo analyst hi guys good morning thomas l bene president chief executive officer and director good morning edward kelly wells fargo analyst i wanted to start off with a question on gross profit per case your gross profit dollars exceeded case growth in us broadlines again after really kind of i guess stalling over the last couple of quarters so obviously encouraging i would imagine that this is reinflation normalization of inbound freight better local mix i mean all things that are good for you and the industry obviously is there anything else in here that was driving that and should we expect that to continue going forward joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i think ed this is joel i think the other thing you probably i think you summarized it pretty well the only thing i might add is the our brand growth again that s something 59 percentage points up again in our local brand sales this quarter so i mean i think that s i d say that s one other area that s certainly strongly impacting that and so i think you re right i mean again some of the few other things that you did talk about again to tom s point the inbound freight piece was a little bit of an overlap issue i d call it that if you recall a year ago we were talking about it was a fairly sizable impact for us so there s probably some heavier a little bit of heavier influence from that but broadly speaking i think the mix the brand the more inflation and again some normalizing some of the impacts we had on the inbound freight i think it s certainly a fair way to look at that edward kelly wells fargo analyst all right and then just on the opex side the growth in opex moderated a bit from q1 but still reasonably high and obviously that s warehouse labor and driver pay just thoughts on where you are in terms of having to raise wages on both of those sides and how are you thinking about the necessity of future wage increases just any thoughts on whether things are settling down at all there for you thomas l bene president chief executive officer and director hey ed i think what s happening is we are kind of at a new level we talked about it on the inbound side and certainly i d say on some of the internal operating expenses having said that so i don t think we were necessarily anticipating any larger significant cost like hourly increases that are going to dramatically change the opex going forward where we re really focused on is how do we go after some of those big cost buckets that drive the expense and so for in this business as you all know there are things like miles driven there are things like cases per mile so the efficiencies that we can drive that really impact the cost or the things that we re trying to focus on and we ve got a couple initiatives that we feel early days are helping us and performing well we ve talked about small delivery vehicles a bit in the past we think that that s a mitigating factor in the fact that we can bring in kind of non cdl drivers in that environment and deliver those cases at a lower cost per case so we re trying to do a lot of those things that ultimately help the overall cost the operating expense if you will more broadly on a sustainable basis knowing that we do have higher wage rates than we did in the past and that we ll probably continue to see that going forward but i don t think it s a new spike that s coming in front of us i think it s more we ve now kind of hit that number and we are now just trying to manage the overall utilization of our headcount and our resources joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer i think if i can add one thing to that also is just the again part of our part of the challenge we re having was some of the retention of some of the newly hired associates and so i think it was which was then driving overtime which is then driving other things that have kind of lowered little bit lower productivity and so i think some of where we are also making a significant emphasis on is in terms of our hiring our training our onboarding processes to ensure that we do have a better retention rate with some of the hiring both on the driver and the warehouse side but i think and again i think to tom s point i agree i think it s leveled out somewhat but certainly not in a position to really say we re past the issue edward kelly wells fargo analyst joel just one quick one for you on the tax rate when you say the full year tax rate at 25 i think the adjusted tax rate in the first half is lower than that how should we think about the back half tax rate i guess that s what i m asking you joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i would just look at the whole about a 25 run rate would be the way i would think about that edward kelly wells fargo analyst okay thank you operator your next question is from the line of ajay jain with pivotal research ajay jain pivotal research group analyst yes hi good morning thanks for sneaking me in on the cost cutting that you ve just announced it sounds like those initiatives are mostly focused on us operations so i don t know if there is any international component for the headcount reductions but can you give any additional geographic breakdown on the latest cost cutting initiatives and then within the us what s the relative breakdown of the cost cuts between regional operating companies and corporate joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer sure so it s joel i ll start here so the discussions we had regarding the cost cuts here was it was exclusively focused in our us business and really on our corporate office and corporate support so i think this was not a what you call us field related it was again it was really specifically in our us and corporate and support operations so i think the some of the things that we did talk about on a few of the certain items was related to again some of the infrastructure changes we had in bringing our businesses together in france but what you re specifically asking about is us is us related only ajay jain pivotal research group analyst okay and i know you didn t want to provide a dollar amount for the cost savings in response to an earlier question but can you at least confirm what you re expecting for overall restructuring charges that s associated with the layoffs joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes ajay we haven t given that out we re not planning to ajay jain pivotal research group analyst okay thank you very much joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator your next question is from the line of bob summers with buckingham bob summers buckingham research analyst hey good morning guys you talked about volumes being choppy during the quarter but coming back toward the end but any comment on how january was and any impact from the shutdown thomas l bene president chief executive officer and director i don t think we saw much of an impact from the shutdown i think what i d say is we feel good about how the quarter started and we feel like it s delivering on the trajectory that we had hoped bob summers buckingham research analyst okay and then circling back to the cost saving numbers when i think about the transformation and the smart spending and having a second half impact is it fair to say that you re trying to get us to wait that more toward the fourth quarter thomas l bene president chief executive officer and director i don t know that we ve said that bob i mean i think we ve been pretty consistent in saying that we anticipated improvement in the second half of the year having said that that doesn t mean day one in q3 is like everything happens and so there is a little bit of a spreading over the third quarter where things kick in which i guess would then suggest fourth quarter will be a bit stronger but we ve been pretty consistent again as we move through second half and as these things do happen again it s a little bit of ramp over the course of q3 bob summers buckingham research analyst right of course and then lastly as i think about all the expense savings that you ve articulated and are they sufficient enough to drive the expense growth say below 2 5 which would allow you the opportunity to flex that spread up which if you think about achieving the plan at some point you ll have to overachieve on that spread for a couple of quarters to get back on track is that fair to hold you to that thomas l bene president chief executive officer and director i think it is and certainly again we certainly acknowledge that and again certainly continue to look for acceleration of opportunities there but yes i think that s fair bob summers buckingham research analyst okay thanks operator your final question is from the line of andrew wolf with loop capital markets andrew wolf loop capital markets analyst thanks and good morning so in the quarter the us local case growth i think you face the toughest year ago comparison of this economic cycle if you will so given the commentary you just made tom that you like how january is and what you had said about the macro environment really i guess i don t think that you got easier comparisons it shouldn t be too much of a leap of faith for us to get the model somewhat better case growth than you showed this quarter thomas l bene president chief executive officer and director look i think i d start with and we talked about this prior quarter and we talked about it again here in the second quarter we had we lost some cases from acquisition that we did a year ago hfm also a couple of large national customers that we lapped we have another acquisition that we re going to be lapping that we did last year a larger one and then the ones we ve done that we re going to be lapping kind of in the third quarter so i would say my commentary around the start to this quarter is it s in line with what we had hoped and what we expected and so we feel generally good having said that you guys all know many of you live in the frozen where the polar vortex happened a week ago we saw we see always things that come up and happen throughout the quarter that we are all happen to deal with and so you see little impacts from things like that as well in certain parts of the geography so i would just say we feel good about the momentum we ve had we feel like it we re on the path that we had hoped for and i don t think there s anything that would necessarily should change your thoughts your projections one way or another i think you should the commentary we ve given is we feel good about the back half we feel like we can deliver the incremental upside that we ve talked about primarily driven by a lot of the cost activities and we re feeling pretty good right now joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer the only thing i would add to that just a slight caveat is just remember i mean our third quarter our march march is our big month in other words it s so certainly couple again talked about as tom said some decent trends coming out of this thing but obviously our q3 is made or broken to some extent by march but just as a reminder of that andrew wolf loop capital markets analyst sure thank you for both of those comments and just to close on product cost inflation and talking about how it inflected and we can see those in the numbers of the governance reports as well just curious do your systems and management allow for that to be passed through if possible almost real time number one and how about competitively is there just a normal lag just a sense that nobody wants to be the first guy to move up prices or do these prices get through pretty much pass through pretty much as they occur thomas l bene president chief executive officer and director hey andy i think what i would say to that is that just keep in mind the order of magnitude of these things too i mean we always talked about is that this industry with a couple percent inflation typically has been historically able to pass those things along and so certainly we continue to feel good about that and i think a little bit of a lag if you think about half of our business being contract with some inaudible there is typically a little bit of lag in terms of when we actually are able to book cost increases and then pass that through so it s not sort of an immediate thing and on the local side again i would just say in these times of what i call modest inflation i think we generally feel pretty good about our ability to pass those things through so i don t know i wouldn t call us in a place where we ve got some rapidly accelerated inflation i think we re in a pretty good inflation point and certainly feel pretty good about our ability to do so andrew wolf loop capital markets analyst okay and if i could lastly just on the international gross margin contracting a bit this quarter sort of a trend is that still mainly driven out of the uk where the cost inflation you re getting because of their currency or is it more broad based thomas l bene president chief executive officer and director it s primarily uk a little bit also in mexico but it s primarily uk andrew wolf loop capital markets analyst okay thank you joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks operator thank you for joining us today this concludes today s earnings call you

rochester n y business wire transcat inc nasdaq trns transcat or the company a leading provider of accredited calibration repair inspection and laboratory instrument services and value added distributor of professional grade handheld test measurement and control instrumentation today reported financial results for its third quarter ended december 29 2018 the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 which ends march 30 2019 fiscal 2019 reported results include the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of angel s instrumentation inc angel s effective august 31 2018 lee d rudow president and ceo commented from a sales perspective we continued to capture market share in our service segment and are winning more business from large customer based labs where our operations are embedded for the long term we are also encouraged by the way the last part of the quarter improved in the u s over the start of the quarter unfortunately canada continues to be a soft market given the global trade and tariff uncertainties there that have muted our u s results that said we are encouraged by the early read into our fourth quarter and the solid pulse we sense in both our segments especially in the u s while our service segment continues to grow especially in the life sciences sector in the third quarter we faced short term productivity challenges this included the timing of those customer based lab contracts which we won in the quarter resulting in incurred ramp up costs such as hiring and training technicians in advance of the contract official start date this combined

gaap financial measure and page 9 for the adjusted ebitda reconciliation table balance sheet and cash flow overview on december 10 2018 the company entered into an amendment to its amended and restated credit facility agreement which replaced its previous term loan that had a balance of 12 5 million with a new 15 million term note and extended the maturity until december 2025 at a fixed interest rate of 4 15 the previous term loan had a variable interest rate based on libor the excess funds of the new term loan were used to pay off the previous term loan and pay down amounts

the prior year period capital expenditures were 5 5 million for the first nine months of fiscal year 2019 investments were primarily for assets for the company s rental business and customer driven expansion of service segment capabilities outlook mr rudow concluded we are on track and expect to close fiscal 2019 with record revenue and earnings and expect to achieve favorable quarter over quarter comparisons when excluding the extra week from last year s fourth quarter as fiscal year 2018 was a 53 week year we believe we remain on target to achieve our longer term goals for the business we expect our technology especially automation and process improvement to drive productivity increase capacity and ultimately produce higher margins in addition we are starting to employ the pricing analytics and optimization that helped our distribution margins to drive increased margins in our service business all of which is expected to create a strong foundation for the future and better position transcat to both grow and withstand future macro challenges we also believe we are doing the right things to keep and attract technical labor in a very tight labor market through a variety of recruiting on boarding training and career development programs lastly recent service contract bookings are at record levels and our pipelines for new business and acquisitions are strong both of which we believe position us for a strong fourth quarter and momentum entering fiscal year 2020 transcat lowered its income tax rate expectations for fiscal year 2019 to range between 24 and 25 the company refined its capital expenditure expectations for the full year fiscal year 2019 to a range of 7 2 million to 7 4 million capital investments will be primarily focused on technology

will be posted once available note 1 non gaap financial measures in addition to reporting net income a u s generally accepted accounting principle gaap measure we present adjusted ebitda earnings before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization and non cash stock based compensation expense which is a non gaap measure the company s management believes adjusted ebitda is an important measure of operating performance because it allows management investors and others to evaluate and compare the performance of its core operations from period to period by removing the impact of the capital structure interest tangible and intangible asset base depreciation and amortization taxes and stock based compensation expense which is not always commensurate with the reporting period in which it is included as such the company uses adjusted ebitda as a measure of performance when evaluating its business segments and as a basis for planning and forecasting adjusted ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and is not calculated through the application of gaap as such it should not be considered as a substitute for the gaap measure of net income and therefore should not be used in isolation of but in conjunction with the gaap measure adjusted ebitda as presented may produce results that vary from the gaap measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non gaap measure used by other companies see the attached adjusted ebitda reconciliation table on page 9 about transcat transcat inc is a leading provider of accredited calibration repair

while the s p 500 the nasdaq among other global stock indices surged off the back of news that the u s federal reserve s chairman jerome powell would be putting a policy rate hike on the backburner some pundits are still wary of a looming crash even crisis and interestingly some have argued that if the american economy descends into chaos bitcoin and other leading crypto assets could surge and garner notable levels of traction worldwide economist stocks trading at most obscene valuations ever according to a report from business insider dr john hussman an american economist investor and hedge fund showrunner isn t too happy with wall street analysts claiming that the market is doing all fine and dandy in a post made on his company s blog hussman funds the economist remarked that while many hotshots may be yelling buy buy buy to respond to december s imbroglio stocks remain at their most obscene valuations in u s history hussman even quipped that at current valuations remain extreme while market fundamentals are negative overall hussman wasn t even afraid to call out wall street s biggest shills noting that postulated earnings growth is likely to fall short of what we ve observed over the past couple of decades elaborating the former professor stated one of the more cringe worthy features of the behavior of investment professionals here is the spectacle of wall street analysts touting the reasonableness of valuations on the basis of year ahead earnings expectations that they themselves are responsible for fabricating the economist even went on to liken analysts current attitude to that seen prior to the great recession of 2008 where advisors staved away from deterring reckless speculation but promoted extrapolative projections to push the bottom line while he couldn t put a finger on where the economy would stop correcting citing a chart outlining an inverse margin adjusted p e plot he remarked that downside is likely hussman s most recent harrowing forecast comes after he accurately predicted the collapse of the dotcom bubble in fact during march 2000 hussman claimed that the nasdaq 100 then filled to the brim with technology firms would fall 83 to proceed a rebound and to the surprise of many his prediction came true over the next two years down to the exact percentage point the american investor also called the s p 500 s lackluster performance over the millennium s first decade and 2008 2009 again with eerie accuracy the hussman funds head isn t the only hedge fund manager to be touting bearish sentiment ray dalio the showrunner at bridgewater associates the world s most preeminent hedge fund recently took to a panel at davos to claim that the immense levels of debt that u s corporations have racked up have him quaking in his boots more specifically he remarked that as borrowing rates rise the market could quickly enter a phase of dramatic tumult dalio one of the most well known billionaires in the investment realm even drew parallels between today s environment and the one seen in the midst of the great depression the bridgewater c suite member noted there are a lot of parallels between now and the late 1930s from 1929 to 1932 we had a debt crisis interest rates hit zero then there was a lot of printing of money and purchases of financial assets brought their prices higher so if history is any indicator as it often is hussman and ray dalio may be the soothsayers predicting an upcoming bear market but will anyone listen to their haunting cries where do bitcoin crypto fit in it seems that the crypto community has begun to hear the foreboding cries from wall street s prophets per previous reports from newsbtc the fed s recent decision to keep target rates relatively low which in turn should inflate the economy has made bitcoin believer travis kling worried beyond compare via a scathing tweet kling a former portfolio manager at point72 a hedge fund managing the personal assets of steven cohen noted that the value proposition for a non sovereign hardcapped supply digital form of money bitcoin effectively summarized in a sentence just become that much more apparent the investor currently based out of los angeles running a crypto hedge fund named ikigai explained that he believes fed chairman powell s dovish nature will catalyze the fourth round of quantitative easing qe kling even noted that incessant money printing which is a key aspect of qe efforts is like a drug adding that the american economy may begin to overdose so to speak catalyzing a collapse in the eyes of many including many dollar skeptics such as max keiser jeff berwick among others the widespread collapse of the legacy financial world will only push crypto assets higher as their non sovereign decentralized and often deflationary nature becomes ingrained in consumers minds in fact in a comment made in late december the point72 alumni stated that there is a significant chance crypto is the
