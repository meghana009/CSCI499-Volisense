rising wealth inequality and the growth of an ecosystem of fake the gallowglaich follow 13 min read dec 2 2019 1 listen share the rise of the economic libertarians thatcherism and reaganism in february 1975 following publication of the selsdon declaration ref 1 outlining a radical set of right wing philosophies ideological concepts and proposals based around a speech by nicholas ridley margaret thatcher was elected leader of the british conservative party the institute of economic affairs arranged a meeting between a nobel prize winning austrian economist and philosopher friedrich hayek best known for his defence of classical liberalism and thatcher in london soon after subsequently thatcher visited the conservative research department for the first and only time in the summer of 1975 a speaker had prepared a paper on why a middle way was the pragmatic path the conservative party should take avoiding extremes of left and right before he had finished thatcher reached into her briefcase and took out a book it was hayek s the constitution of liberty interrupting the pragmatist she held the book up for all to see this she pronounced sternly is what we believe and banged the hayek book down on the table on 3rd may 1979 the conservative party ousted the incumbent labour government with a parliamentary majority of 43 seats and the die was cast for major changes ronald reagan was 69 years old when he was sworn into office for his first term on 20th january 1981 in his inaugural address which reagan himself wrote he addressed the country s apparent economic malaise arguing in this present crisis government is not the solution to our problems government is the problem it can be strange how history can turn on terrible events particularly if there is no presence to counter rightist bullies manipulated by background groups this is disturbingly familiar to the situation in 2018 which is far worse some who enthused in the 1980s over the wonders of unproven trickle down economic theories later commented upon the awfulness of increasing inequality once reality dawned in fact the chicago school monetarist economic theories were simply excuses for hammering labour forces making it easier to hire and fire encourage tax reductions and increase the freedom for a small few to make profits at all costs decline of the middle classes in oecd countries in most oecd countries a majority about 70 on average has long identified itself as middle class see figure 1 from oecd ref 2 in northern and continental european countries as well as italy and turkey that proportion identifying as mc is higher than income data would suggest whereas the opposite now holds true for a group of countries including us uk canada spain and portugal with the proportion in those countries considering themselves as mc 40 60 having fallen significantly over the last ten years this fell from two thirds to one half in the us and canada this probably reflects rising economic insecurity following the 2008 financial crisis accompanied by a lack of confidence in future labour market and economic prospects higher job insecurity and income volatility may have pushed mc self identification downwards as people feel less certain about maintaining their socioeconomic status in the future the usual grouping of higher mc proportions which have been maintained is clear including all the scandinavian countries netherlands germany belgium france luxembourg 75 90 it is suggested that the following list of symptoms explains much that has taken hold of substantial groups of people particularly in england america this has led to damaging anger fury and long term mass psychological effects in certain sections of something margaret thatcher believed did not exist society this anger results primarily from loss of work prospects and security plus rapid changes and uncertainty about the future for people and their children the middle classes in some countries have effectively almost collapsed with wealth flooding upwards and staying there rather than trickling downwards as was suggested might happen distractions have been provided accepted as softening comforts via an ever cheapening celebrity culture a terrible resort to crass narcissism increased attention to mental trivialities rising excesses of shopping over consumption of food cheap drink and drugs constant talk of imaginary elites mistrust of experts and educated individuals and an explosion in general anti intellectualism always bubbling under in british and american cultures figure 1 decline in middle class self identification 2000 to 2015 note the middle income group is defined by population share with equivalised household disposable between 75 and 200 of the median subjective middle class group comprises the population that self identifies as lower middle middle and upper middle class source ref 2 oecd world bank the inequality bifurcation anglo u vs euro l there now increasingly appears to be a powerful but rather nasty cocktail present of the following symptoms underlined and exacerbated by an ecosystem of fake lies designed to confuse ill inform whole swathes of societies to ensure the maintenance of power money and influence unbalanced socio economics a why should i when they do that feeling edited versions of past national histories elevation of feelings above facts festering social resentment crass celebrity culture media envy fed by belief in a right to perceived entitlement imbued belief that all can be special individuals severely fuelled egotism and false group greatness clinging to exacerbated shallow materialism complete lack of any spiritual thought or reflection immense rate of societal change insecurities subconscious war guilt nasty racism and exceptionalism the political far right continue to provide loud blaring populist siren backing for large business concerns and extraordinarily wealthy individuals this well worn set of theme tunes include claims about destroying economies with high taxes attacks on welfare scroungers and the usual use of immigrants and foreigners as scapegoats these deliberately over played falsehoods have been used globally for decades by political right wings in hard times the reality is that where taxes are higher the mcs are usually rather strong but the right tax levels must be carefully maintained which has been the trick to pull off for social democracies which have worked and succeeded in europe the reasons for the decline in earnings and size of the mc in countries such as britain and the us are not due to high taxes excessive immigration or greedy crooked welfare scroungers even if some media political and industry groups and individuals would like voters to believe that the following from the oecd world bank published in december 2016 ref 2 lists three sets of key facts key facts 1 almost two thirds of people live in middle income households in oecd countries in emerging economies the equivalent figure is between one third and one half the size of middle income groups has slightly decreased in the last decades but this happened mostly during the 1980s and 1990s the rate of decline has slowed recently today people in typical middle income households are older more educated with fewer children than in the past more than two out three people in the oecd consider themselves middle class mc self identification has fallen significantly in recent years much more than income trends would suggest key facts 2 a strong middle class contributes to higher levels of trust middle class decline fuels social and political instability a shrinking middle class can be a threat to economic growth key facts 3 the mc plays a significant role in shaping the welfare state economic influence of middle income groups compared to upper income groups has been declining the cost of typical mc goods services and assets are rising faster than median incomes and driving some middle income households into debt figure 2 evolution of inequality 1900 to 2010 source our world in data org ref 3 the inverse of the key facts in list 2 is also true figure 2 ref 4 shows groupings of two sets of countries on the left five english speaking countries and on the right european countries plus japan there are clear indications that inequality in the english speaking countries started to increase around 1979 1980 eventually returning to the levels seen before ww2 with a clear u shaped reverse long term trend as a further illustration of these trends ref 5 in the uk the well known gini coefficient rose steadily from 25 in the late 1970s to 35 until about 1990 then remained constant see figure 3 in addition the proportion of british children living in relative poverty rose from around 15 in 1979 1980 to just under 35 in the early 1990s see figure 4 it would be wrong to claim that increasing top income inequality has been a universal phenomenon on the right side of figure 2 it may be observed that in equally rich european countries and japan the development is quite different in contrast to that seen for the english speaking countries with the income share of the rich decreasing reaching a low point in the 1970s however top income shares did not return to earlier high levels but remained flat or increased only modestly the evolution of top income inequality follows an l shape with inequality in europe and japan much lower today than at the beginning of the 20th century figure 3 uk gini coefficient of disposable household income inequality source resolution foundation ref 5 figure 4 proportion of children in uk living in relative poverty source resolution foundation ref 5 globalisation service economies and technological change since the mid 1980 s inequality increases in most advanced countries have increased due to factors such as globalisation technological change and the shift to service based economies rules have been rewritten to make the situation more favourable for the rich whilst being disadvantageous for everyone else large companies have been permitted to accrue more power over markets while the influence of workforces has shrunk taxation and other policies have consistently favoured the wealthy rigged rules also explain why the impact of globalisation has been worse in the us ref 6 concerted attacks on american unions has halved the number of unionised workers to about 11 of the workforce in scandinavia it is roughly 70 weaker unions reduce worker protection against companies who want to drive down wages or worsen working conditions investment treaties such as the north atlantic free trade agreement were sold as a way of preventing foreign countries from discriminating against american firms but these also protect investors against a tightening of environmental and health regulations abroad and enable corporations to sue nations in private international arbitration panels for passing laws that protect citizens and the environment but threaten a multinational s profits such provisions enhance the credibility of a company s threat to move abroad if workers do not temper their demands and weaken workers bargaining power even further globalisation has benefited millions of the poor in emerging economies particularly in china however data compiled and displayed in the world inequality report 2018 demonstrate that between 1980 and 2016 the steepest gains went to the world s top 1 which captured more than a quarter of the growth in the global economy in early 2018 oxfam international reported that just 42 individuals have as much wealth as the bottom 50 put together see fig 5 the middle classes in the us and western europe have benefited the least from global growth as have the world s poorest ref 6 figure 5 uneven distribution of global growth source stiglitz 2018 ref 6 since the late 1970s productivity in north america and western europe has generally doubled but wages for production and non supervisory workers have stagnated with virtually all the gains from increased productivity going to investors and owners however the salaries of the top 1 including corporate executives and finance professionals increased by over 150 between 1979 and 2012 this increased wage gap has played a major role in spiralling inequality fig 6 figure 6 widening wage gap source stiglitz 2018 ref 6 financialization the erosion of growth one of the side effects of debt fuelled speculation spending is financialisation the growth and increased prominence of a financial industry since the 1980s that produces no physical product is alarming and should be of great concern its very purpose is to properly allocate capital and resources to desirable in demand industries whose very existence relies on the success of other industries if the financial industry is able to properly allocate capital resources it is able to grow or shrink along with unsuccessful industries if a misallocation occurs if a general hollowing out of production occurs in a country something that is rarely disputed when addressing several late 20th and early 21st century north american and european industries this would typically result in a smaller financial industry not a larger one yet the explosion of growth in the finance industry since the 1980s has been in stark contrast simply because debt fuelled investment speculation and debt based spending has exploded since the 1980s debt fuelled investment speculation can be seen in fig 7which shows the three periods in the 21st century where long term returns on stocks have been reduced with each peak fuelled by different forms of speculation that ensure low future returns figure 7 the three speculative episodes of the 21st century source third wave finance ref 7 the dilemma is that debt temporarily inflates the price of desirable assets until the point in time where that debt needs to be paid back which constrains economic growth if the majority of an economy has unproductive debt which has not created an income stream to repay the principal amount borrowed plus interest there are then defaults write downs etc which have a punishing effect often leading to destruction or evaporation of investments and assets together with plunging prices this is because debt is always considered an asset by the issuer yet in reality debt is not always an asset for the issuer there are increasing improper claims of assets which effectively do not exist that can outnumber the actual underlying assets financialisation due to debt leverage speculation and the adding of layers and complexities has developed into a seriously dangerous situation the growth of the credit bubble after a brief period of optimism world leaders economists investors corporate executives and many others are back to worrying that the global economy is failing to take off as hoped yet those in power and even most top economists don t seem to grasp why this is happening they talk about weak consumer spending the threat of deflation wonder if interest rates are too low or too high worry about the effects of inequality but continue with policies that favour the rich and punish the poor central bankers stuck for new ideas keep feeding the financial sector with cheap digitally created money in the hope that this will somehow boost spending when all it does is inflate stock markets and re inflate the credit bubble and the offshore bank accounts of the wealthy fig 8 figure 8 the growth of the credit bubble source roscoe un and world bank ref 3 there is little consensus or understanding of what is really wrong with the economic system most leaders don t blame the system at all claiming that if everyone simply spent more money everything would be just fine it matters not if you have not actually earned the money just borrow more if there can only be more growth generated everything will sort itself out and be rosy once again just like before the crash debts will magically disappear but the reality is that total global debt is now higher than ever fig 6 the credit bubble is bigger than it was before the 2008 crash the majority are still getting poorer while the rich keep getting richer speculative manias gather speed through expansion of money and credit there are many more economic expansions than there are manias but every mania has been associated with the expansion of credit in the last hundred or so years the expansion of credit has been almost exclusively through the banks and the financial system in boom entropy in regulation and supervision builds up danger spots that burst into view when the boom levels off charles kindleberger financialisation the prominence of the finance industry and the growing dominance of obscure types of investment becomes clear since the 1980s it has grown due to temporary debt based investment speculation and debt based spending although financialisation is temporary since debt constraints eventually cause a readjustment the real danger is that the temporary misallocation of wealth that occurs rewards the financial industry in a boom bust cycle investment that would have been used in other in demand industries had productive debt been pursued is instead concentrated and used up in the financial industry and when coupled with the ability to influence politics this temporary reward misallocation can cause a further entrenchment of an undeservedly rewarded industry a further misallocation of wealth figure 9 total global credit market debt owed source roscoe us fed res bis economist world bank ref 3 conclusions the empirical research of roser and ortiz espina ref 4 demonstrates that political forces at work at a national level were highly important in determining how incomes have become distributed after the major changes of the early 1980s in the english speaking economies a universal trend of increasing inequality everywhere would be in line with the notion that inequality is determined primarily by global market forces and technological progress however the reality of two markedly different inequality trends namely the anglo u versus the euro l suggests that institutional and political frameworks in different countries have played a substantial if not dominant role in other words inequality is not inevitable it has in fact been driven by policies and actions it is relatively simple to argue that this anglo u inequality bifurcation has had a severe effect in reducing the size and income levels of the middle classes in english speaking countries this is due to adherence to the base lie of nonsensical trickle down economic concepts which resulted in a spurt upwards of growth profits which is basically where large amounts of money has gone stuck and stayed much of it lodged in offshore tax havens this has occurred in tandem with the following symptoms deregulation and increased globalisation debt explosion leading to massive upward money flows to very wealthy production of unavoidable qe bubbles which fuel future instability increased tendencies toward corruption crash and chaos inability of

the erosion of growth
the u s economy proved remarkably resilient in 2019 defying recession fears that dominated the headlines throughout the year the economy has entered the longest expansion in american history surpassing the economic boom of the 1990s united states consumers buoyed by the strong labor market have continued to drive economic growth during the past year against a backdrop of weak business sentiment increased hiring and rising wages have powered consumer spending which accounts for more than two thirds of the u s economy the stock market also rose steadily throughout the year boosting household income and allowing people to spend more the consumer is really driving growth and hasn t been impacted by weakness in manufacturing export and business investment federal reserve chairman jerome powell said during a press conference on oct 30 the trade dispute with china hasn t affected consumer spending either despite tariffs on chinese imports changes in retail prices kept pace with broader inflation mainly due to china s devaluation of its currency according to economists the united states economy grew at an annual rate of 2 1 percent in the third quarter growth for 2019 is predicted to be 2 3 percent weaker than last year s 3 percent however the slowdown is worldwide and the u s economy held up relatively well compared to other advanced economies according to gary cohn and kevin hassett former white house economic advisers the united states is the only group of seven countries that will post growth above 2 percent this year they wrote in a wall street journal op ed adding that tax reform boosted productivity and wages the united states economy expanded for a record 126th straight month in december the longest expansion on record and the country finished an entire decade without entering a recession for the first time ever according to a cnbc report meanwhile the global economy recorded its weakest growth in the past 10 years according to the international monetary fund rising trade tensions poor business climate and activity as well as country specific weaknesses in emerging markets have been a significant drag on global growth in 2019 trump has called the united states economy the envy of the world it s also been a good year for u s stocks the market valuation of the united states stock market has recently climbed to a record 1 5 times gross domestic product global slowdown and trade risks however weighed on business confidence in the united states the trade war with china in particular led united states firms to slow their investment decisions in 2019 economists however started to see a silver lining business equipment investment remains weak related to the global slowing in manufacturing activity citigroup economists wrote in a global economic outlook report however there are signs that global manufacturing weakness is bottoming they said adding that a pickup in united states domestic activity could also boost equipment investment and manufacturing in the first half of 2020 fed policy despite the solid economic activity downside risk from slowing global growth and trade tensions led the u s central bank to cut its benchmark federal funds rate three times in 2019 the federal reserve slashed its target interest rate by a combined 75 basis points in july september and october fed officials however signaled that the current cycle of cutting rates is over they stated that monetary policy is currently in a good place and that a material reassessment of the outlook would be necessary to ease policy further this suggests a higher bar for future rate reductions citigroup economists suggested but added that interest rate cuts would be more likely than rate increases in 2020 strong dollar the strong united states economy has continued to attract investment in 2019 from all over the world because of the perceived safety of united states markets as a result the u s dollar has risen to a record high relative to emerging market currencies geopolitical tensions also boosted demand for the dollar the dollar s high value relative to other currencies will likely continue in 2020 according to the institute of international finance the major driver of the dollar is excess demand for dollar denominated stocks and bonds and other assets robert scott senior economist at the economic policy institute told the epoch times we ve got a problem with too much capital coming into the united states he said adding that the trade deficit is widening as the strong dollar keeps making imports cheaper and united states exports more expensive trade wins in december president donald trump got a major win on trade after the united states mexico canada trade agreement passed the house also the united states and china announced that they would sign the phase one trade deal in january these two deals will allow trump to go into 2020 with a very strong economy according to stephen moore an economist and former trump campaign adviser the state of the economy is the overriding factor in how people vote moore told the epoch times i believe that americans vote with their pocketbooks it s the economy stupid he said recalling the famous motto coined by bill clinton s campaign strategist that summed up clinton s election in 1992 the trade deals would boost trump s reelection chances in 2020 moore said fiscal future while the economy is in a stable position the fiscal future deserves more attention in 2020 according to jim glassman head economist for jpmorgan chase s commercial banking operation as of november s end the united states government s budget deficit over the past 12 months exceeded 1 trillion for the second month in a row due to a surge in federal spending and the federal government s debt surpassed 23 trillion for the first time in history while recessionary and other economic fears loomed large in 2019 the expansion proved quite resilient glassman wrote in a report that said fiscal reforms may be needed in 2020 to keep the united states on a sustainable path

speaking about agriculture arvind subramanian said direct cash should be given to farmers former chief economic adviser to the government of india arvind subramanian spoke to dr prannoy roy on the state of economy in an exclusive interview saying the government s figures of gdp growth 4 5 percent could be a rosier picture than the underlying reality mr subramanian further said the economic downturn the indian economy is facing is not an ordinary slowdown but something that hasn t been seen in the last 20 30 years following is the full transcript of the interview hello and welcome it s a very very special program because we are all worried about the indian economy there are some positives there are some negatives but if there is one person who can really analyze it through experience is arvind subramanian we have done programs before when he was chief economic advisor now he is teaching at harvard university and he has done a lot of amazing work on the indian economy the good the bad and the ugly and the overall summary is india s great slowdown in the preparation for this i must also thank one of your researchers for many years navneeraj he has been a great help navneeraj sharma who really helped simplify and make us understand exactly what is going on wonderful we kind of divide this program into three parts first will be it s like a patient and a doctor arvind is a doctor first he looks at the symptoms how bad is the indian economy what are the signs and symptoms of things going right and wrong secondly okay given the symptoms what is his diagnosis of the problem why is it happening what is the disease what are the positives and what are the negatives and finally as a doctor what remedies does he prescribe dr roy arvind there is a lot of work on it and for once you have worked in your life how long is this i mean you have you been working last two three days arvind subramanian firstly it s a coauthor with a colleague of mine who is the imf representative josh feldman he is my chief economic advisor together we worked on this for three four months now dr roy three four months on this one paper and it s causing quite an impact but i think it s more when i read it i feel i do follow the indian economy quite closely but i learned a lot let s start with the most simple straight forward fact most of know this but just put it in stark terms just have a look at this is the indian economy heading for icu just look at the figures here the figure suggests that the growth rate is plummeting in india plummeting meaning it was 8 a short while ago and now it s 4 5 in the most recent quarter and these are government sources so arvind when it was 7 8 you wrote that very strong paper with a lot of analysis of why our data is not too good it s probably 2 5 higher so 8 would have been 5 5 so 4 is bad enough even its correctly 4 could it be even less than that arvind subramanian well you see as you know that the gdp numbers are you know becoming you know not as informative as it used to be i mean there are difficulties with those numbers dr roy is it around the world recognize now that there are some problems with the numbers because it never used to be arvind subramanian yeah i think now globally accepted that you know gdp numbers need some you know looking at carefully so the answer to your question is four and a half and four and a half you see i can t be precise but as we go through the indicators that we are going to go through now you know to look at the more detail macro indicators you know you get the impression that in fact maybe even four and a half is a picture a rosier picture than the underlying reality dr roy that s shocking because i would be feeling awful about the country if it s going about four and a half percent i mean it s back to old school raj krishna days and it could still be really 3 that is just horrifying arvind subramanian i can t give a number as we go through the indicators we will see that in fact it is something that we are going through as you said is a great slow down it s something that probably we haven t seen for a very long time 20 30 years you know the real economy is in it s not just any ordinary slowdown dr roy i really feel that s the point that you highlight in this paper and i don t think everybody has understood the magnitude of the problem i knew we were in bad shape but till i read your paper i felt that that was a problem and i look at some of the indicators that make you even question whether 4 5 4 5 is depressingly low but if it s lower than that and some of these indicators suggest that just look at this if you look at imports how bad is the indian economy imports are almost as bad as 30 years ago as you were saying we have never seen bad indicators for the last three decades so in the current growth imports are down to 6 and the capital goods industry really important almost proxy for investment down 10 when you have gone 6 and 10 you have to go back 30 years to find things similar look at that imports okay 16 and little more and capital good industry 9 very comparable and what was the growth rate 30 years ago 1 1 with that kind of figures so when we look at the figures today 6 and 10 what is the gdp growth is it really 4 5 based on the comparison we would have to question it arvind subramanian see i think you know many many not just there are also export figures consumer goods figures tax revenue figures in fact in the paper what we do is that we take all these indicators and then say let s look at you know a previous era of a slowdown which is 2000 and 2002 yeah there what you find is that even though the gdp growth around then was four and a half all these indicators were positive it s only you have to go back to 1991 when growth was close to 1 dr roy in a terrible slowdown of 2001 2002 these two indicators we re actually marginally positive and others and you still had 4 5 with positive now it s negative and you have to go back 30 years to find that that is a real shocker and that really does make you question whether with this king of figures you can have 4 5 but anyway we will get into as you say there more figures to point out to let s have a look at the indian economy the great slowdown more indicators of that just have a look at these first for example in fact if you look at finding consumer good production growth rate consumer goods it s not just capital goods consumer goods production growth rate is falling look at that from 5 just 2 years ago to 1 now 1 in consumer good production is worrying isn t it that kind of that growth rate arvind subramanian so i think one way of thinking about it is if you look at all these indicators pranoy yeah they are either in negative growth territory or they are barely positive growth territory right and you know what it says is like this is not any slowdown that s why it s india s great slowdown see the comparison with 1991 1992 we have to be careful because you know we don t have macroeconomic crises at all in fact one of the achievements of the government has been to stabilize the macroeconomy you know inflation has come down our reserves are very healthy we have no external debt problem so we are not going to have a currency crisis inflation is relatively low in 1991 we had this bop crisis major destructive that s not the comparison the comparison is with what happened to the real sector of the economy you know growth investment exports and imports which matters for jobs which matter for lives it also matters for how much revenue that the government has to spend on social programs so the interesting thing is that and maybe we can talk about that later what s you know the way this slowdown is going to manifest itself or is manifesting itself is not in terms of you know oh exchange rate collapse or inflation rate going up dr roy one thing we have done over the last thirty years is this huge foreign exchange reserves so we don t need to go rushing to the imf and ask for money arvind subramanian yeah not even close very robust macro economy but on the real sector economy is slowing jobs you know people s incomes people s wages and of course government revenues and what it does to social spending programs dr roy see okay these are all index of industrial production and various other forms of symptoms one of the symptoms you point to which actually rings very close to everybody s understanding is how much electricity is being generated if that s up it s a good sign if everything is down and that s up something s wrong but look at what electricity generation growth is happening in india it is really really serious it s a sign of a major crisis the great slowdown electricity the lowest growth in 30 years 30 years look at that of course it goes up and down over different cycles but look at the two earlier terrible low points 2001 3 2008 09 10 again after the great financial crash 2 5 and now electricity generation has grown by 1 8 that really makes you feel that s serious arvind subramanian you know this is of course one amongst many indicators and it is an important indicator you know that the chinese prime minister li keqiang he did an index he said he also had doubts about chinese numbers on growth rates so he said no let s measure it some other way and in that you know electricity is a very crucial component dr roy okay yeah arvind subramanian so this only reinforces all the other indicators that we ve seen which suggests that something serious is happening in the economy dr roy yes imports down arvind subramanian exports down dr roy consumer goods down exports down arvind subramanian capital goods down tax revenues down dr roy capital goods down tax revenues down okay let s just have a look at tax revenues well let s quickly look at exports what you mentioned and then come to tax revenues because again historically exports show whether your country s really booming whether there is there is some external factor the lack of global trade it s shrinking but still a growth rate of 9 2 years ago which was not great by the way 9 exports is not great down to 1 now and this is non oil both imports and exports are non oil to be comparable so why is this happening 1 again part of the same problem or combination arvind subramanian so i think that on the export side part of it is related to global factors even if there is of course the global economy is not doing as well as it used to but there s also the question of whether now there are domestic factors at work you know for example the ease of doing business the exchange rate has been slightly strong for some period of time and you know the competitiveness of the indian economy the competitiveness of our manufacturing and you know and also our services exports you know they did very well earlier now they re doing just modestly well so all of these i think are they all kind of the pattern is the same with all these indicators dr roy the pattern as you were saying earlier all these are real factors that affect jobs and people s life even exports do exporters are going bust and you know 1 arvind subramanian just to give you a benchmark between so in the 1990 s between 1992 10 year period when the economy did quite well our exports were growing in double digits similarly in the 2000s when we were doing very well exports were growing double digits and now it s you know 1 dr roy this kind of trend downwards is a big worry now all this affects not only jobs as you said it also affects how much revenues the government gets if the economy is doing well it has a huge impact on revenues let s have a look at how much direct taxes there s a big squeeze currently on government and you as the finance ministry and i was there many years before you were born feel sorry for finance minister who looks at this direct tax direct tax we are not even talking about gst here direct tax revenues are falling they were growing at 16 these are nominal of course arvind subramanian but this is adjusted for inflation dr roy oh yes you had adjusted for inflation so we would ve been maybe 19 so adjust it by about 3 4 maybe 16 10 and now 0 growth that is terrible arvind subramanian so essentially with both direct taxes and the gst we re collecting for the first 8 9 months for which data were available were about 3 and a half 3 6 which in inflation adjusted is virtually 0 so essentially the government is squeezed for resources dr roy right and when you say direct taxes you mean personal tax and corporate tax arvind subramanian so direct taxes are personal income tax and corporate tax the main ones and gst is very similar the gst aggregate gst for the country as a whole dr roy really makes a finance minister task difficult you ve got some sympathy for somebody who has got no growth in revenue no real growth in revenue arvind subramanian i think the only point to make one important point to emphasize is that you know there s a lot of talk about say you know the gst is not performing well they look at the numbers and say and today we wrote a piece saying that i think that s actually being very harsh on the gst i think actually the gst revenue performance has been quite good revenues have come down not because the gst is doing badly it s because the economy is very weak dr roy i mean you can tell by direct taxes so it s almost the same in fact may be doing marginally better than direct taxes marginally like 0 1 arvind subramanian exactly so i think that we should not be harsh on the gst because the gst itself has done dr roy it s a reflection arvind subramanian yeah it s a reflection of the economy dr roy right so those are symptoms which i find i didn t realize how serious it was now remedies doctor sorry diagnosis then we ll go to remedies so what is the cause of the problem so diagnosis now what is the cause as a doctor you ve given 3 or 4 kind of reasons for the slowdown let s have a look at some of the reasons that could be causing this great indian slowdown just have a look at this the reason for the slowdown is basically a breakdown of our financial system and there have been so many other diagnoses but this one is the key one that you focused on and it kind of relates long term and short term problems arvind subramanian so you know obviously we simplified a little bit that what is i think the reason we are where we are today is because of a combination of long term factors and short term factors but they re both connected by the financial system what we re going to call the first the twin balance sheet formula dr roy the famous twin balance sheet yeah arvind subramanian one and then the second wave of the twin balance sheet yeah but remember the long term factors also include the fact that our exports have you know completely compared to the previous decade they ve slowed down remarkably as we showed you so that s one lockdown factor investment also is down but the investment is critically related to this twin balance sheet a challenge we re going to come to that dr roy one of the things i just wanted to ask you we had talked about exports but we ve been so lucky with imports in oil i think in about 2014 15 oil prices came down by half you d think india was just an oil importer i mean largely when oil prices come down from 110 dollars per barrel to 60 or 65 you think we d boom arvind subramanian it s a good point prannoy but what we say in the paper is that you know these structural factors when exports and investment kind of collapsed quite a bit then why did the economy sink even further and the answer is that oil price is actually it gave us a boost gave a boost to revenues it gave a boost to consumption so it propped up shored it up and prevented it from becoming much worse than it otherwise would have been dr roy that s very kind it s like when you go to a doctor and he gives you aspirin and you say my head is better but it s not there and he says it would ve been so much worse if you hadn t had the medicine arvind subramanian no but that is true the oil price gave us a bit of a cushion for you know 3 4 years dr roy yeah if you drop from 110 to 60 or 65 that s wonderful for a country like this arvind subramanian another thing to mention is that in terms of the short term factors several people have said you know weak agriculture performance which may be true as well you know demonetization in gst dr roy you know but sorry weak agriculture means it s not been a terrible monsoon every year we ve been pretty lucky with that arvind subramanian yeah but prices agricultural prices were down so agricultural incomes were down so that s a short term factor dr roy output not down incomes down which matters to the average farmer arvind subramanian exactly and then of course everyone has spoken about the demonetization gst that has also probably has a short term impact as well but what we argue in the paper is that these may be important but the key short term factor is a second wave of the twin balance sheet dr roy so it s now four balance sheet problems arvind subramanian yeah we re going to come to that hopefully but essentially to summarize the first balance sheet was when the public sector banks led to the infrastructure companies and you know there was over exuberant lending there was also some cronyism you know a lot of bad lending went on and that created the first wave where then see and the way to understand the twin balance sheet crisis is that you know the infrastructure sector had too much debt right and this was actually first pointed out by ashish gupta of credit suisse he did that famous house of debt in fact the regulators and the government were all behind so dr roy so they were just hiding the non performing assets and he said its way higher arvind subramanian yeah the debt was way higher for the corporates dr roy let s have a look at what your paper says about the double twin balance sheet or twin twin or four balance sheet problem it s linked to the breakdown in the financial system earlier the twin balance sheet problem or the crisis was banks and infrastructure companies corporates of the infrastructure area right mainly everybody was affected but banks were giving in to infrastructure and they were not being able to pay back arvind subramanian because remember growth slowed down considerably these loans were made in the boom period and then when the growth slowed down many of these investments went sour dr roy so bank loans to infrastructure corporates and others that could not be repaid they could not repay them so they both had the infrastructure company balance sheet affected the banks balance sheet arvind subramanian because they couldn t repay the banks dr roy so what s happening now is the four balance sheet crisis the first twins and another twin this is nbfcs now for those who are not quite familiar with these arvind subramanian can i just explain nbfcs dr roy yes please arvind subramanian so nbfcs are essentially non bank financial companies they do on the lending side they do lending like the banks but they don t take money from depositors so that s why so in a sense they are less sacred in some ways because with the banks depositor money is involved you want to be ultra sure that you know everything is safe nbfcs take a bit more risk because they don t borrow from depositors but they do the same lending with banks too yeah so in the second wave dr roy so they nbfcs gave a lot of money to real estate companies and real estate has had a real hit so they ve not been able to pay back nbcs we ve seen a major nbc ilfs arvind subramanian no ilfs is not ilfs is an nbfc but ilfs is well let s just come to ilfs dr roy okay just generally nbfcs they are all in the doldrums right now and ilfs is a special problem they re just one kind of nbfc but generally nbfcs and for the same reason more or less arvind subramanian so just to summarize the first twin balance sheet was public sector banks lending to infrastructure companies dr roy infrastructure meaning roads bridges arvind subramanian no like the companies that built the roads the airports the bridges in this second wave what happened and remember it s important to emphasize also is that this second wave essentially credit picked up after demonetization that s important from about march june of 2017 for about 4 to 6 quarters these non bank financial companies and also the banks lent a lot and a lot of it went to the real estate sector so now when the real estate sector has not done well the real estate companies which do real estate have you know taking a hit and you know the nbfcs who lent to them have taken a hit so that s why the four balance sheets now dr roy very clearly explained and really important but it was all that because of high expectations people expected the economy to do well infrastructure to do well and just look at the housing sector what has happened to it it has really belied all our expectations it s failed all our expectations i should say so the collapse in the real estate sector the real estate bubble have a look at this housing sales are 2 lakh crores a year this is the housing sector 2 lakh crores a year arvind subramanian this is housing top 8 cities dr roy top 8 cities 2 lakh crores and look at the amount of unsold houses 8 lakh crores a year and it s been this kind of for the last 3 or 4 years so we are just about building enough to we are building about 2 lakh crores a year because that 8 lakh crores unsold remains every year this is huge arvind subramanian yeah so the way to understand see we call this in the paper a non bubble bubble and i ll explain why that is the case you see this is kind of a little bit counterpart of what happened you know in the global financial crisis in the united states and in some other countries so when all this lending goes to the real estate sector what normally happens is that prices go up houses get built and there is a very buoyant market in india what was different was all this money that was going remember lending to real estate was growing at 20 a year 20 per year both the banks and the nbfcs but it was mostly or largely financing the buildup of unsold inventory so essentially you re not lending to build but you re lending to just maintain the inventory so how does this bubble kind of burst as it were maybe if you show the next graphic dr roy we ll have a look at the next one it s a big collapse in lending arvind subramanian commercial credit yeah dr roy in commercial credit right across the board of which housing is one major important part so collapse in commercial credit and part of it is the impact of ils bubble crisis we ll come to that but as part of the collapse in commercial credit housing loans have also plummeted just look at commercial credit how it s dropped from 22 lakh crores that s a lot of money what is it now 1 lakh crore arvind subramanian this is like savage savage it s a savage credit crunch but this is where i want to spend two minutes explaining dr roy yes yes arvind subramanian whenever something like this happens it s like a major financial sector crunch or you know the episode it happens because of two reasons there s a trigger and there are some fundamentals which are unsustainable so the trigger for this was you know ilfs going into default in august 2018 now why was it a major trigger it was a seismic event it was a seismic event for at least two reasons one how did this appear out of nowhere 90 000 crore ilfs company you know regulators no one sounded a warning about it no one knew about it so 90 000 crores and it turned out to be a huge behemoth but over and above that people said look if this can happen what else is wrong in the financial system dr roy all the other nbfcs and the other sectors yeah arvind subramanian then they looked at the real estate sector so that was the trigger the fundamental is that you know essentially this lending was financing the buildup of housing so it was not a profitable business right it was a bit like a ponzi scheme what we call ever greening right you just give money to keep that same level of thing and people said this is unsustainable and it s the combination of the trigger plus these fundamental lending then the crunch happened because then the banks everyone says what happened was that dr roy these things suddenly happen arvind subramanian the people who were funding the nbfcs some were banks some were mutual funds we don t have to go into they suddenly withdrew and then everyone dr roy all the nbfcs got badly affected arvind subramaniam exactly and then the banks and the nbfcs suddenly stopped lending altogether because they said you know it s a risky business dr roy they re not getting money it s a risky business it was like a arvind subramanian and this is the credit crunch that now has you know really severe in its intensity which has caused the growth to come down so sharply dr roy from 22 to 1 i m going to ask you a ridiculous question is this ilfs almost like the lehman crisis that are you seeing something really serious happening in this 22 to 1 arvind subramanian this is you know what s impacting the economy credit is the grease that runs the economy if you don t have credit you know everything slows down we re seeing manifestations of this everywhere but i think the fact of you know ilfs plus these nbfcs because now is where the four balance sheets really are operative right banks are still although the npas the banks have come down they re still quite high now we have nbfcs dr roy npas we should say are non performing bad loans bad debts arvind subramanian and now the nbfcs are there and then you know the corporates and the real estate sector are that s the source of the problem as it were why i think the outlook is a bit somber is when we come to the next chart which is that the fact of the slow growth itself and the credit crunch is itself going to aggravate the problem dr roy that s what i was going to ask you pretty bleak up to now is it going to get worse let s have a look at what arvind subramanian has written about looking a little ahead and what are the fundamental underlying problems that are causing this and could be a worry for the future is the crisis going to get worse or not or is it just temporary companies are actually now paying more in their bank interest than their expected earnings that s a huge statement and it really is a worrying statement if every year you re paying more out on servicing your loans just the interest than what you re earning in profits it s a big worry look at company finances according to this paper interest rate on loans currently is 10 5 to companies and look at what their expected earnings are likely earning 6 1 so look at that gap that means there s a gap a shortfall annually of 4 4 now tell us how you get these figures arvind subramanian so just to explain this a little bit remember so companies borrow they make profits and they repay their interest and the loans on that a kind of proxy see for any one company you want to proxy it by their profits but for the corporate sector as a whole generally what we say is that earnings are likely to grow on average with nominal gdp growth so that s a kind of indicator of how earnings and profits are likely to go so that is what you get and then you have to repay what you borrowed and for the corporate sector as a whole it s about 10 and a half percent in boom periods like you know in the 2000s and the 1990s it was completely the opposite the nominal gdp growth was like 15 20 and interest rates again were like 13 14 so the difference was kind of 5 6 7 now its 4 5 6 and this is going to add to the stress on the corporates and therefore that s why we have to have this in mind when we assess the outlook going forward because what this suggests is that things probably are going to get worse before they get better dr roy things are going to get worse before they get better arvind subramanian and i think that s important to understand because in some way we have to break this cycle of you know earnings growth nominal gdp growth being much lower than the cost of borrowing we can come to that later but this is also going to affect the government because the government is going to be squeezed as well dr roy so the government is facing a similar squeeze you know the income tax revenues are down to 0 and they are paying interest rates so arvind subramanian so this squeeze on the private sector and the government sector is going to add to the current uncertainty and somber mood and that s why i think we need a real package of actions both what shouldn t be done and what should be done in order to break this cycle quickly dr roy otherwise if we don t do all that is this like heading for a debt trap cause if you re going shortfall of 4 a year that s not good news arvind subramanian yeah so if you look at in fact ashish gupta s latest numbers for a measure of corporate stress it actually jumped in the latest quarter quite substantially it s basically measured by what is the debt with companies that find it difficult to repay their interest he has a very nice measure on that and it jumped from about 42 to 45 in the most recent period and it reflects as exactly this so if this continues that corporate stress is going to go up and that s why we need to break the cycle and that s why the doctor now needs to turn dr roy now we ve done the you ve had a look at the symptoms now we re going to the diagnosis and treatment so we looked at the symptoms you gave a diagnosis of the problem we saw now what are the remedies and how are you going to treat the economy let s have a look one by one at some of things first what should you not do cause given your diagnosis certain things you would treat would exacerbate the problem so what not to do first in the solution of the crisis budget deficit currently does not reflect the true picture because it s got hidden expenditures so stop those what do you mean by that hidden expenditures arvind subramanian yeah so something are in control of the auditor general pointed out are headline deficit have been coming down but you know some major expenditures like for the subsidies for food food corporation of india some of the infrastructural spending like national highway authority it s not reflected in the budget of balance sheet therefore the true budget deficit the control auditor general is quite a bit higher than that dr roy so the declared budget deficit is around what is between 3 to 3 5 arvind subramanian so if you consolidate center and states dr roy just take center loan for the time being arvind subramanian yeah the center i think the headline somewhere 3 5 dr roy if you include these hidden factors of the balance sheet 5 5 and sorry with the state arvind subramanian states i think the number one number it s kind of something the private sector it s between 8 5 and 9 of gdp and this year the number it s probably going to deteriorate dr roy we have been so proud of the central government budget deficit coming down to 3 3 5 but actually its 5 5 that s awful you are just putting more and more stuff out of balance sheet that has to stop arvind subramanian so i think there are two lessons in this actually one is that i think just to follow cag and get the accounting to be you know much clear dr roy and what you are saying here is that don t think your budget deficit is low and just increase the budget deficit oh that s the second point arvind subramanian second implication is that we actually probably don t have any space at all dr roy if you are 5 5 increase in budget deficit to boost the economy arvind subramanian and remember if you look at the combined end you don t want to get into the double digit deficits for the center and the state governments that happened just after the global financial crisis and then it happened in the 80s so we know that makes a debt fiscal situation much more tricky and fragile dr roy very important point 3 5 you had a little room and you could say and what you are saying the second you raise is that do not try and boost the economy do not raise government spending don t boost the economy by raising government spending a lot of people are saying that s what you need to do arvind subramanian so exactly a better way to put is don t increase the deficit anymore because it is already very high yeah we just don t have room dr roy and that s the third point you said again which everybody is saying and you are saying do not cut personal income tax rates because you are 5 5 budget deficit and not 3 5 so don t think you have got room to play well arvind subramanian here there are two points here pronnoy one is whether we have room for this or not right but the second point is that look there is a general concern that we have to boost the consumption which is a valid concern right but then you have to ask that if you cut the tax rates to boost consumption who does this benefit because who pays the individual tax the top 4 5 of india the bottom 90 are much poorer you know those are the people whose consumption you want to boost so if you want to boost the consumption in limited space you have an allocation problem you know to give it to the rich salaried middle class and they are also very high up in the distribution system so i would say therefore if you have to boost consumption a much more effective and just way of doing this would be to give something like transfers direct benefit transfers you know universal basic income or even expand programs like pm kisan much more effective and much more equitable way dr roy taxes just affect relatively rich lot then you also say do not raise gst rates and your final point is do not blame gst for all this explain this arvind subramanian look there is lot of pressure to increase the gst rates coming from what s happening between the center and states states say give us 14 center says we don t have money in the gst so that s why the pressure has come to increase the gst so i think the reason not to increase the gst rates now is when an economy is kind of slowing down you shouldn t raise rates and second it s very odd you know on one hand you want to reduce the income tax rates to boost consumption and the other you are also raising the gst rates which is actually going to affect the consumption dr roy and by the way both contradictory as well as one is for the rich and other one is for everybody it just doesn t make sense arvind subramanian so what i think we need to do is we need a wholesale re evaluation of the gst rate structure but once the economy has recovered in a kind of slowdown is not the time to tinker with these things let the economy stabilize and then we need a wholesale review and then we should probably go much more to the structure that i suggested in my revenue neutral rate report just have 3 rates and we should you know kind of stop tinkering dr roy everyone now says three rates even one is fine but these rates where cashew nut here almond is here it s too complicated but implementation has been a problem arvind subramanian you know but all that being said it s not the time and gst is one of the fantastic achievements of this government both politically administratively technologically because revenues are down the gst revenue reflects the weak state of the economy gst is doing quite well we do need to revisit it but now is not the time dr roy only problem i think you mentioned and many others said that 5 rates or 6 rates is so complicated so it s a great idea implementation lacked a bit of arvind subramanian i mean you simplify that it absolutely dr roy we should just stop here because most economists know what not to do you have gone one step further which is really very brave of you what you should do and you have got a list of things let s go to it one by one what does the doctor order for the economy now dr arvind subramanian what does he say what should be done number 1 this is a crucial issue although a bit academic fix india s data problem we need to know whether we are growing at 10 8 6 4 1 we need to know that arvind subramanian prannoy i am going to push back you a little it s not an academic problem not just an academic problem because i think there are two huge problems that come to fixing it if we solve the data problem one is it just gives confidence and trust in the government goes up globally investors and that remember has an impact on the animal spirit but i think the second reason is that how can you navigate an economy when you know some basic number remember that depends not just on gdp in an article we wrote i can pose now 4 5 basic question that policymakers need to answer for which the data are not reliable just take the budget for example the headline is 3 5 but the cag says more which is it the second example on the loans bad non performing loans the bad loans are they under control or they have again gone out of control because of the nbfc crisis dr roy the data on that has been hidden you are right it s not just academic arvind subramanian and let me say one more thing there a new sharp point about why it matters let me give you an example this whole debate on compensation of 14 to the states it s come up and people say its been so high and states are saying you have to pay prannoy the thing is that when that 14 was kind of devised we had a sense that the economy is growing at a rate of 7 7 5 so you said oh 7 7 5 inflation is what 4 4 5 that gives you like 12 compensation of 14 for the state is not unreasonable because your revenue was going to grow but if actually the gdp is growing at say 3 your compensation would have been really different not academics actually very very crucial for so many policy decisions dr roy i take my words back because you are academic and i have to dig it and that s a fact that that you need to know to decide your policies arvind subramanian it s like a very complex car you know if the speedometer doesn t work you don t know how much air pressure is you don t know how the fuel tank is full or not i mean it s not easy to navigate economy in such circumstances not academic at all dr roy this would take a bit of time but this needs to be done as fast as possible because you don t know to a say a little academic you go 8 to 4 or 6 to 2 you know you are slowing down you can say this data at least gives you direction but i suppose actual numbers also matter in terms of say deficit you have room to play with you know direction in terms of you can see your revenue is going down how much are you going down what s the plan this is your practical side finally ok let s move on to other factors that need fixing first fix the financial system several points here number one independent assessment of bad loans really focus on that arvind subramanian a bit of history i think part of the reason why this problem has festered for so long because i think collectively government regulator rbi we have been in denial to the true state of the problem i think once we saw what is the true state of problem we mobilized policy actions and the government deserves a lot of credit for enacting the ibc the bankruptcy code under which some real progress have been made but today now again after this new bout of lending to the nbfc we similarly need to know how much is the bad stuff unless you don t know that dr roy again more of a symptom than an actual problem because part of the problem is the phone call inko loan de do otherwise you will lose your job that has to also change arvind subramanian that has to change but that is a much deeper problem but for the moment lets come clean on what we know so that we can take the requisite action dr roy we can see whether more phone calls are being made or less like many people say that elections cause black money actually it s the money you can make after the election when you are in power and then invest in the next election so unless if that changes the phone calls you will be getting loans here is an indicator of how many phone calls are being made arvind subramanian the other point to make in the current context i want to emphasize is that people are saying now that the new problem is the nbfcs which made all these real estate loans no i don t think that goes far enough because nbfc are connected to the banks it s the banks that also lend to nbfcs so in the new assessment we have to also see that the true state of the banks themselves are dr roy so the point here you raised is and i will put two of them together now you mentioned improve the bankruptcy code it s working reasonably well but there are lot of delays and there are few anomalies and they have made some changes recently and the second point which is related to the first two is that create a bad bank for power and real estate a bad bank you mean arvind subramanian two bad banks essentially the way a bad bank works the government sets up an agency it takes all the bad loans off the books of the regular banks and then it tries to extract the best possible value from it either you change the management you find the best bid through a transparent process dr roy that s a separate set of skills or maybe a separate banks for those sort of skills arvind subramanium you know but the risk of getting complicated because the ibc was meant to address this precise problem but the point we make now is say for the power sector the ibc may not be the appropriate avenue so let me try and explain it as simply as i can ibc essentially the way it should work you have a kind of transparent market for determining the true value that s it then either you liquidate or you change management and you extract the maximum value you have to write off the loans but the thing is what if the true value as it were depends on the other actions the government has to take so in the power sector many private sector plants are built which are highly efficient but they are not working for whatever reason supposing the tariff goes up to reasonable levels suppose we could phase out the inefficient plants the value of these assets go up so where true value depends upon other government action that has to be taken it has to be done through a specialized bank that s what a bad bank is dr roy let s have a look at your next point which is increase the supervision of the nbfc now they have been reasonable success until the big collapse now but totally unsupervised and that really was a mistake arvind subramanian see here this is actually a much bigger point than nbfcs if you were to look back at the financial system for the last ten years i mean there has been a series of catastrophic neglects as it were there you know if you look at the series of things first all this lending how many collapses have you had ilfs punjab and maharashtra cooperative bank we have the punjab national bank the nirav modi thing and you know series of things then now deewan housing i mean where was our regulative mechanism why didn t we stopped it there is no easy solution for this but going forward we need to really really strengthen this dr roy in a professional way you don t want people to be threatened you have good system you have good auditors maybe private auditors but somebody who doesn t threaten nobody will move an inch then arvind subramanian i think the important principle is somehow you know we kind of lost sight of the essential principle that in business the principle should be innocent until proven guilty dr roy and that is also affecting the investment arvind subramanian and i think because if people are guilty if they are defaulters by all means go after them but the default should not be that everyone is guilty until proven defaulter dr roy you know it affects foreign investors two things people have told me foreign investors they don t come because of the pollution in fact many embassies can t find people to come here and the other thing they say is i don t want to come to india because there will be lot of false cases against me that s a terrible reflection of what s actually happening and why people don t want to invest arvind subramanian yeah see remember for two decades now we have had this problem of what i call the 4c problem that public sector officials honest ones private sector people have this fear of the investigating agencies curts cvc cbi cag 4 cs so i think we don t want to make that problem worse through arbitrary through investigation dr roy there need to be checks as you say innocent until proven guilty the next point you make again a very important point is quite a controversial shrink the public sector number of banks which refers to privatize more banks more independence of banks from the government arvind subramanian i have kind of lost faith in the sense that we could somehow create independence for the public sector bank we have said this time and again it s kind of einstein s definition of insanity you try and do the same thing again and again and think that things will be different here i think there are many things possible one is to privatize few banks the other thing is to allow much more entry more banks to come in give license you can go to a new model of dfis which could do the long term project lending in a way banks can t this is more a kind of long run thing dr roy it is a big worry that the public sector banks are in too much political pressure from any parties states governments whatever you want to say arvind subramanian and the other side is we forgot i think from the last 5 years 3 and a half lakh crore of tax payer money have gone into the public sector banks you know so this is like sucking in tax payer money dr roy they are finding it tough enough to privatize air india but at least there are private airlines in india at least there are private airlines in india finally let s have a look at the next point on fixing the financials provide funding to only those banks who are reforming systems and processes arvind subramanian when government is injecting money into banks firstly a lot has gone on but in a sense all this money has gone in just to get the banks at prudent levels of lending and have enough capital unless you get the reform of these things along with the money it s business as usual we have pumped in a lot of money we now have to differentiate we now have to see those that do the reforms show that their underlying risk management is better dr roy we now move on to another area which everyone says is really distressed the agricultural sector you have spent a lot of time on this let s look at what arvind subramanian says about fixing agriculture arvind subramanian number 1 main thing is direct cash to farmers direct don t give it through fertilizer companies power companies so that they get cheap fertilisers and power just give them the cash direct there are statistics showing farmer incomes have gone down despite subsidised fertilizer and power dr roy because they are not being passed on i guess arvind subramanian farm incomes have come down despite production remaining the same international prices have also come down fertiliser and power subsidies create so many adverse effects overuse soil quality environmental quality health quality and they go disproportionately to large farmers so any long run sustainable agriculture in india has to have this the big point here is that we have to raise agricultural productivity i think that should be overarching objective here dr roy the next two points we take are related and very important and don t seem too tough to do create one all india market for agricultural products that in itself will increase incomes by 20 25 arvind subramanian the government has this enam platform that they have started dr roy the second point is to stop the constant flip flop in agricultural trade policies sometimes you have high tariffs sometimes low tariffs goes all over the place arvind subramanian so this is a point that prof ashok gulati makes very strongly when prices go up we impose controls export controls and other controls and when prices go down we impose tariffs but essentially what happens is that you don t guarantee policy certainty to farmers so the person who ends up getting hurt by this is the farmer because he doesn t know what prices he is going to get dr roy one this that does affect is cropping pattern the way we give msp minimum support price on wheat and rice effectively and many others we don t actually pay it people are producing wheat and rice that we are short on onions pulses so cropping patterns arvind subramanian subsidies are very important part of that the delhi pollution problem it has many many components but one part of it is punjab shouldn t be growing so much rice and they are growing rice because of the msp and the power and water subsidies dr roy cropping patterns disincentives and incentives are skewed up couple of other points one very controversial and one not incentives for water conservation including drip irrigation you mention final one we will lose 3 quarters of the woke audience because you are an og right you are an og allow new gmo crops there s huge controversy about that it s more emotional than being based on facts there s nothing really being shown about the direct connection between gmo and cancer is that correct arvind subramanian see i don t want to get into the details of this as it is a little controversial but i do think if you think about the cotton revolution in gujarat for example dr roy that is gmo arvind subramanian it s all gmo right look at china for example brazil we should not have a kneejerk thing against it we should assess have proper regulation dr roy key point is give the farmers gmo let the farmers grow gmo crops their imcomes will go up 3 times arvind subramanian in agriculture one big point is productivity second point is it is not new why doesn t it get done dr roy that s where i will end with asking why it doesn t get done and for average viewer for me the statistics are very worrying we should get out of stock exchange real estates are we heading from an economic slowdown to a collapse arvind subramanian part of the reason why it is not getting done is because many of these policies are determined by both states and centre so we need gst type cooperative federalism to implement this otherwise it will be very difficult dr roy the average viewer what should they do about this worrying diagnosis arvind subramanian i will summarise in 4 5 big points 1 this is very serious it has structural components and short term components it s the great slowdown we shouldn t expect that things will automatically get better i think we should moderate our expectation about what long run growth will happen in india our world economy is not sustaining the kind of exports that happened in 2000s we have a balance sheet challenge third the standard remedies to get out of this reduce interest rates increase the deficits those tools are not available this is not despair or giving up we are not entitles to 8 9 growth i don t like despair it s in our hands over the next few months there will be good news the economy is getting better
please make sure these dispatches reach as many readers as possible share with kin friends and workmates and ask them to do likewise dispatches from moon of alabama by b this article is part of an ongoing series of dispatches from moon of alabama the latest putin bashing piece in the new york times is headlined it s putin s world we just live in it its first sentence already includes two falsehoods its economy already smaller than italy s may be sputtering but two decades after a virtually unknown former k g b spy took power in the kremlin on dec 31 1999 russia and its president vladimir v putin have just had what could be their best year yet the nyt can claim that russia s gdp is smaller than italy s because it only looked at the nominal gross domestic product gdp of those countries but nominal gdp like nominal wages are not meaningful comparisons the question is how much can be bought for each nominal unit andrei martyanov has recently looked at two quite comparable houses one near moscow and one near washington dc the russian house costs some 93 000 while the u s one is offered for 440 000 so let us calculate gdp created by building these two houses in russia and in us right as you may have guessed it already the united states created 4 5 times more gdp than russia by building comparable house in a place which let s be frank is not exactly moscow mind you that russia builds all kinds of real estate from apartments to houses like there is no tomorrow here is how ppp purchase power parity gdp works or rather confuses most western think tank free loaders who do not understand that most of what they know about the world outside is a baloney or a caricature like the fact that china s real middle class which has incomes comparable to that of the average us income is larger than the whole population of the united states that is a good hint now can you scale down or scale up russia s and american economies difficult still but it shows you at least what all those proverbial 22 trillion of the us gdp are worth not as much as you may have thought before nor is the argument that russians do not earn as much entirely valid yes many russians do not earn as much and that is ongoing problem but say r60 000 which roughly converts into 965 gets you pretty comfortable living practically everywhere in russia bar some places like moscow or sochi especially if you own you apartment very many russians do and by own i mean own not paying mortgage there is a lot of what is going into those economic considerations but it has to be understood today that nominal numbers in usd are absolutely meaningless and in fact dangerous because they create a false sense of confidence the gdp of russia by purchase power parity is 4 349 423 m the gdp of italy by purchase power parity is 2 442 768 m so it surely does not look as if russia s economy is already smaller than italy s corrected by purchase power russia s official gdp ppp is about as big as germany s but even that comparison is skewed russia s official gdp is chronically underestimated as the country has a large unofficial economy it is estimated that 20 30 of all work in russia is done in exchange for cash and is never officially registered or taxed when one considers that russia currently has no noticeable population growth its economy growth is still fine it slowed down this year but it is certainly not sputtering economic growth in russia will be higher than expected in 2019 and is likely to pick up in the next few years thanks partly to higher state spending and looser monetary policy the world bank said on wednesday the world bank in a regular report on the russian economy said it expected gross domestic product to expand by 1 2 this year up from the 1 0 it projected in october in 2018 russian gdp grew by 2 3 in 2020 russian gdp is seen at 1 6 and in 2021 1 8 versus 1 7 and 1 8 respectively projected in october the world bank said unlike the fed and european central banks which have pushed interest rates to zero to create artificial growth in unproductive financial markets the russian central bank held back and still has lots of ammunition left and the russian federation has a very sound budget and little debt should a growth spurt be needed russia still has unlike others the economic ammunition to provide it a less restrictive monetary policy and increased spending on the national projects is expected to help foster growth renaud seligmann world bank country director in the russian federation said in the report the central bank will next meet on interest rates on dec 13 where it may consider cutting the key rate now at 6 5 for the fifth time so far in 2019 the rest of the nyt piece is not any better than its very first paragraph it simply repeats false stereotypes about putin as an autocratic leader or about the non existing russian influence on u s elections nearly thirty years ago when the soviet union broke apart russia had a deep fall the liberalization of its economy had catastrophic consequences but it has since reformed itself it is now back to its traditional position in the world a large eurasian power which is in nearly all aspects independent from the rest of the world and able to protect itself it must therefore be taken into account when one thinks of global polices that is simply a fact and not the effect of a mindgame that russia allegedly plays with the west that the u s still has problems to understand that is not russia s fault but the result of the skewed descriptions of it posted by b on december 23

people walk past a bank branch in rio de janeiro brazil reuters brazil s government sent congress a bill designed by the central bank to regulate financial firms during a banking crisis that mandates the use of public money for bail outs but only as a last resort if approved the bill would create two new mechanisms that would dictate how different financial firms would be treated the first the so called stabilization regime is aimed at larger banks that pose a risk to the country s banking system but will require specific secondary legislation to dictate how firms are chosen the second known as the compulsory settlement regime would be aimed at smaller entities and focus on removing the company s senior managers and board the company and shareholders money would be prioritized in the case of any losses failing that losses would aim to be covered by the industry itself with contributions from other banks to an emergency fund known as the credit guarantee fund only as a last resort would the government step in and provide a publicly funded bail out according to the bill brazil s fiscal responsibility law currently bars the government from bailing out banks although specific laws can be passed during times of financial crisis to circumvent the law and provide public assistance the latest bill aims to modernize the brazilian government s actions during a banking crisis and place greater responsibility on the banks themselves to cover their losses meaning less of a burden on brazilian taxpayers said climerio leite pereira the head of the central bank s resolution and sanctions department brazil s government does not have an alternative proposal for the privatization of power holding company centrais eletricas brasileiras which appears headed for rejection in the senate according to two people with knowledge of the matter last week senate president davi alcolumbre said the bill proposed by the government for the privatization of eletrobras as the company is known will not be approved by senators due to resistance from the northeastern and northern regions the power holding company controls nearly a third of power generation and around half of all power transmission in brazil the privatization bill was sent by president jair bolsonaro s government to congress last month but alcolumbre said senators from the northeastern and northern regions are against the privatization model brazil s government proposes to privatize eletrobras through a share issuance that would dilute the government s controlling stake the vote on the eletrobras bill is not yet scheduled the proceeds of the share issuance would be used by eletrobras to pay the federal government to extend the licenses to operate most of its power generation assets government sources said there is no alternative plan and that bolsonaro s government will try to convince congress to approve the current version of the bill the privatizstion of eletrobras has been under discussion since the government of former president michel temer who left office at the end of last year the impending privatisation has contributed to a 51 rise of its preferred shares over the last 12 months meanwhile latin america stocks and currencies were looking to close the final week of the year with gains as cooling trade tensions drove demand in thin christmas eve trading with markets in brazil and argentina closed and a light economic calendar analysts do not expect any significant moves in emerging market assets with low trading volumes mexico s peso edged lower against the dollar as data showed latin america s no 2 economy contracted in october from september in seasonally adjusted terms marking a poor fourth quarter start after nine months of stagnation consumer prices fell short of the mexican central bank s 3 inflation target in the first half of december a report on monday showed raising the chances of further monetary easing the mexican economy is still not taking off one of the challenges of the mexican government will be to reactivate local and foreign investment in infrastructure projects alfonso esparza currency analyst at oanda said the mexican peso has outperformed other currencies in the region this year with the trade sensitive currency s december gains supported by the us house approval of new north american trade deal and an initial us china trade pact reuters
emerging markets are at a rare inflection point with multiple crosscurrents a combination of the ultra loose monetary policy hangover from the global financial crisis a low global growth environment from weak manufacturing and industrial activity the continued rise of the consumer and the disruption and opportunities of the new economy have provided a heady mix said manraj sekhon chief investment officer of franklin templeton emerging markets equity addressing uncertainties while market sentiment in 2019 was weighed down by easing growth concerns emerging market growth is forecast by the international monetary fund to accelerate in 2020 and remain more than double that of developed markets improving fiscal economic and monetary policies and a renewed focus on structural reforms in many emerging markets has been gaining traction supported by more conducive monetary policies in developed economies and easing inflationary pressures central banks in emerging markets generally turned more dovish in 2019 we expect this trend to continue in 2020 as policymakers have greater flexibility in stimulating economic activity although us china trade tensions have de escalated in the short term on rising expectations of a partial trade deal and plans for both countries to scale back tariffs we expect the broader economic conflict to remain for some time the impact from the trade conflict has not been limited to china while us imports from china over the last year declined us 35 billion to us 497 billion china s imports from the united states decreased by more than us 40 billion to us 125 billion therefore we believe a comprehensive agreement remains in the best interests of both sides the trump administration will be acutely aware of this heading into an election year opportunities in 2020 china s initiatives to strengthen and diversify its economy have been largely overshadowed by trade and slowing growth fears the government s focus on economic restructuring and long term sustainable growth has led to an acceleration in the implementation of structural reforms and widespread industry consolidation as well as the development of local supply chains in the technology space to replace us sources china will be a frontrunner in the 5g arena and is expected to have some 600 million 5g subscribers by 2025 or about 40 per cent of the forecasted 1 6 billion subscribers globally together with artificial intelligence ai and robotics this will help drive growth in china s new economy as it strives to become less reliant on the united states in our view china will emerge stronger and more self reliant with multiple pillars of economic support through this crisis taiwan is seeing some spillover benefits from the trade war as its companies start onshoring some operations government incentives to attract operations back to taiwan mean that this will have ripple effects on the domestic economy as one of the largest and fastest growing markets for digital consumers india is a market where disruptive technology is driving productivity and deflation more than generally expected with value accruing to end users key reforms including the recent reduction in corporate tax rates measures to improve the regulatory environment and monetary easing will likely steady its economy in brazil optimism surrounding the government s economic agenda has resulted in a more favorable investment climate while the country s economic recovery has been slower than expected we believe government and central bank efforts are improving the country s longer term growth potential inflation has remained under control allowing the central bank to ease rates to record lows to stimulate the economy social security reform is key to stimulating investment and credit which will help improve economic activity and can significantly reduce brazil s fiscal deficit a major privatisation plan has also been announced and tax and other structural reforms should improve the ease of doing business new emerging market landscape the emerging market landscape continues to transform as policymakers focus on building resilience during times of stress emerging market economies are more diversified now with domestic consumption and technology offering new drivers of growth and are growing less reliant on low cost manufacturing and commodities since the turn of the century we have witnessed a significant increase in the trade value of high tech goods being exported by emerging market countries we have also seen how companies are using innovation and technology to leapfrog and disrupt traditional business models areas such as e commerce digital banking and mobile computing will be fundamental drivers of emerging markets for years to come equally fields such as ai autonomous driving robotics and the internet of things continue to attract investment signaling strong longer term prospects staying the course much noise and conflicting signals dominated 2019 which led many investors to limit their risk appetite and discount the long term growth drivers in emerging markets while some of these uncertainties may persist in the near term we believe it is essential to stay the course the markets are just beginning to realise opportunities from technology disruption and the transition of businesses away from traditional models we believe the investment scope in the emerging world is wide and promising for investors who can overlook near term volatility and invest for the longer term what are the risks all investments involve risks including possible loss of principal stock prices fluctuate sometimes rapidly and dramatically due to factors affecting individual companies particular industries or sectors or general market conditions special risks are associated with foreign investing including currency fluctuations economic instability and political developments investments in developing markets of which frontier markets are a subset involve heightened risks related to the same factors in addition to those associated with these markets smaller size lesser liquidity and lack of established legal political business and social frameworks to support securities markets because these frameworks are typically even less developed in frontier markets as well as various factors including the increased potential for extreme price volatility illiquidity trade barriers and exchange controls the risks associated with developing markets are magnified in frontier markets

in june 2016 british voters narrowly approved a referendum to exit the european union the polls going into the vote indicated that the uk would remain the prime minister at the time david cameron supported staying within the union together with the other members on the continent the results of the june 2016 referendum came as a shock the prime minister resigned and handed the government over to theresa may who spent more than three years negotiating with the leadership of the european union and her parliament to fulfill the will of the british people her failure led to another resignation in september boris johnson an advocate of brexit and former mayor of london and foreign secretary under prime minister may took over without a significant majority in the parliament it became impossible for the new prime minister to deliver on his pledge he had promised to take the uk out of the eu with or without a deal on brexit by the october 31 2019 deadline but failed however a general election on december 12 settled the matter giving the new prime minister a lot more power and ability to divorce from the union finally the invesco currencyshares british pound sterling trust etf nysearca fxb replicates the price action in the pound versus the us dollar currency pair a second referendum on brexit briefly lifted the british currency on december 12 the election results from the united kingdom gave the prime minister a vote of confidence as it provided for a significant majority while the voters selected their members of the parliament the votes for johnsonâ s conservative party paved the way for his brexit deal with the leadership of the european union therefore the contest serves as a second referendum and the results were more convincing than the first back in 2016 while the 2016 referendum was close voters told their leaders they were tired with inaction and that need to as the british are fond of saying finally â get on with it â on the day following the election the pound rallied versus both the dollar and the euro currency source cqg the daily chart of the pound versus the us dollar currency pair highlighted that the price relationship rose to a high of 1 3548 on the march futures contract the last time it traded at that level was back in may 2018 the pound ran into selling at the highs and was trading at just over the 1 30 level on december 24 from a technical perspective price momentum and relative strength indicators declined below a neutral reading and were heading for oversold conditions at the end of last week daily historical price volatility rose from under 5 in mid december to 11 on tuesday the total number of open long and short positions in the futures market declined from 278 609 contracts on december 16 to 207 172 contracts at the end of last week a drop of 25 6 falling open interest and declining price are not typically a validation of a bearish trend in a futures market meanwhile the open interest metric fell as december contracts rolled to march and the speculative risk positions from the election exited the market when it comes to the euro the pound briefly rallied to the 1 20 level the highest since the 2016 referendum by christmas eve the pound versus the euro currency pair fell back to the 1 1657 level the prime ministerâ s victory paves the way the new deadline for brexit is at the end of january deadlines had been a moving target for the divorce from the uk but the election makes a vote in the parliament to approve the prime ministerâ s proposal a formality after more than three and half years brexit will finally fulfill the will of the british people the pound and markets have calmed as the leading fear was an exit without any deal however boris johnson and the eu leadership negotiated a solution to the sticky issue of the irish border a dual customs zone was a compromise that both sides accepted meanwhile the uk will now set out negotiating new trade agreements with its old partners in the union as well as with other nations around the globe including the united states those agreements will be crucial when it comes to the future of the uk economy while prime minister johnson will steer the political future of his nation a new leader at the bank of england will have his hands on the economy new chief at the bank of england the bank of england sets the official interest rate for the uk the â old lady of threadneedle streetâ supervises the financial system ensuring stability and liquidity the nickname comes from a james gillray cartoon published in 1797 the central bank acts as the governmentâ s bank and is a lender of last resort in times of financial crisis it issues banknotes while the royal mint issues coins the bank of england is the custodian of the ukâ s gold reserves as well as those of other central banks that diversify geopolitical risk by leaving their gold bars in the central bankâ s vaults in the united kingdom andrew bailey is currently the chief executive of the financial conduct authority the agency that serves as a regulatory watchdog he has spent almost all of his career at the bank of england which he joined in 1985 on march 16 2020 he will become the 121st governor of the bank of england for an eight year term mr bailey will replace mark carney the current governor mr bailey will take over at a critical time for the uk economy as it exits the eu and forges an independent path inflation beats expectations and scotland could be an issue like the us the target rate for inflation in the uk is at 2 last week the market had expected the bank of england data to report a 1 4 inflation rate but the number came in slightly higher at 1 5 with core inflation steady at 1 7 while the inflation data came in higher than expectations a rate cut is still not out of the question over the coming months the political path for brexit could be in place after the election however the economic ramifications of the divorce could still create uncertainty that weighs on the uk economy and creates an environment where lower rates are appropriate moreover the trend of falling rates around the world would make it difficult for the central bank to increase rates or even keep them at the same level in 2020 on the political front the election on december 12 also was a victory for the scottish national party which could set the stage for a renewed independence move scotland was in favor of remaining within the eu from a political perspective the election strengthens the case for independence when it comes to economics scotland depends on oil revenues when the price of crude oil was north of 100 per barrel the scottish economy could operate as an independent nation and member of the eu with brent north sea crude oil at around 67 per barrel the funding from the uk makes separation more of a challenge for the scottish national party and its leader nicola sturgeon however political wrangling between prime minister johnson and the snp leader is likely to be a highlight in the coming months and years ms sturgeon will likely push for a scottish referendum on independence which johnson opposes the pound is a buy on dips i continue to believe that any weakness in the british pound over the coming weeks will be a buying opportunity the issue that weighed most heavily on the currency was the potential for a hard brexit with no deal with the european union with that off the table the pound should find support even as the uk faces economic challenges with the separation and new trade deals and the scottish movement for independence the most direct route for a risk position in the british pound versus the us dollar is via the over the counter foreign exchange or

mexican central bank prepared to act favorable trend inflation has fallen below the target of 2 63 and the peso has performed well this year which could allow the bank to take monetary policy actions bloomberg mexico s central bank could take monetary policy action as soon as february if it sees that inflation as well as internal and external risks remain low governor alejandro diaz de leon said in an interview we have to monitor if conditions in the economy continue having this favorable trend in terms of inflation and lower external and internal risks and if this occurs it allows us to take monetary policy actions he said but this is precisely what we ll be monitoring from now until the next decision the bank has cut borrowing costs by a quarter point in each of its past four rate decisions to 7 25 percent but still has one of the highest real rates in the world that has fueled division within the board about how quickly it should ease monetary policy without risking a rebound in inflation and peso volatility inflation has slowed markedly and even fell below target to 2 63 percent earlier this month the peso has been the best performing major emerging market currency this year gaining further after the us house of representatives voted for an updated north american free trade agreement with mexico and canada earlier this month mexico s sovereign credit default swaps fell to the lowest since 2014 as traders see risks receding diaz de leon who has voted with the majority for a cautious easing cycle signaled that mexico s monetary policy might be better positioned to mitigate fluctuations in investor flows than to boost an economy that has low lending rates monetary policy channels are different for different economies diaz de leon said in what he described as his last interview of this year in mexico probably due to its low penetration in financing as a percentage of gdp it has a credit channel and sensitivity to interest rates different than other economies yet we re an economy very open to capital flows he added however he said that the central bank is not pre announcing future policy actions and would make its decision based on data available at the time of its meetings diaz de leon said that mexico s minimum wage hike of 20 percent for next year is expected to have a moderate effect on inflation but that there are risks of a greater impact in its quarterly inflation report in february banxico could update its projections as more information becomes available he said he would not respond to recent comments from fellow board member gerardo esquivel who said on twitter that those who criticize the wage hike seem to be using arguments from economy 101 two out of five board members have repeatedly voted against the majority and for deeper half point cuts amid concerns over an economy that dipped into a technical recession earlier this year in contrast to the prior three decisions only one member voted for a deeper half point cut in thursday last week s meeting all five members voted said diaz de leon after speculation arose that either esquivel or jonathan heath the two who had sought deeper cuts in previous meetings had been absent both esquivel and heath were appointed by mexican president andres manuel lopez obrador who has said in the past that he would like to see lower rates at the end of next year the president gets a chance to name a third member when javier guzman s term expires giving the mexican president a majority of appointees on the board that should not be a point of concern diaz de leon said we trust that the legal requirements and procedures that need to be carried out will result in the right candidates being picked for the board of governors as has happened in the past he said
lahore dubbing the overseas pakistanis national assets for the umpteenth time during the last one decade premier imran khan tuesday lauded the steps being undertaken by pakistan post to channelize the influx of country s foreign remittances which had recorded a moderate seven percent growth in 2018 due to significant declines in inflows from saudi arabia the country s largest source in this context one must therefore laud the timely initiative of the 33 year old murad saeed the incumbent federal minister for communications and postal services in this regard though a lot more needs to be done not only to increase remittances but also to make the funds transfer process more financially feasibly so that migrant pakistani workers do not use the relatively cheaper undocumented and illegal modes to send their hard earned money back home research conducted by the jang group and geo television network by taking the april 29 2019 report of the world bank and a statistical story published by the american forbes magazine into consideration shows that the top remittance recipients around the globe during 2018 were india with 79 billion followed by china 67 billion mexico 36 billion the philippines 34 billion and egypt 29 billion as far as the ratio of foreign remittances vis a vis the gdp during 2018 is concerned reputed american journal forbes had come up with the following rankings to identify 10 nations which are most reliant on influx of money sent home by their citizens working abroad tonga 40 7 percent kyrgyzstan 33 22 pc haiti 32 54 pc tajikistan 29 02 pc nepal 27 99 pc el salvador 20 68 pc honduras 20 07 pc palestine 16 98 pc samoa 16 43 pc and moldova 16 25 pc while india stands at number 72 with 2 98 per cent ratio of foreign remittances vis a vis its gdp pakistan rests at number 40 with 6 78 per cent meaning thereby that our neighbouring nation has more financial niches and avenues to benefit from in pakistan even if the export earnings and remittances both add together the import figure is still very high hence leading to an adverse current account deficit and consequent borrowing list of some richer countries that are least reliant on foreign remittances for their development and economic prosperity in france this ratio is just 0 97 per cent in austria it is 0 7 per cent followed by iceland 0 65 pc sweden 0 57 pc russia 0 52 pc malaysia 0 48 pc italy 0 46 pc germany 0 45 pc south korea 0 42 pc denmark 0 39 pc switzerland 0 35 pc finland 0 34 pc netherlands 0 27 pc israel 0 25 pc spain 0 24 pc greece 0 22 pc new zealand 0 22 pc china 0 18 pc united kingdom and ireland 0 16 pc each norway 0 15 pc australia 0 13 pc japan 0 09pc saudi arabia 0 04 pc and united states 0 03 pc in 2019 remittance flows to low and middle income countries are expected to reach 550 billion to become their largest source of external financing however the influx of remittances in pakistan was dismal as compared to other south asian nations where transfer of such funds from offshore destination had soared 12 percent to 131 billion in 2018 outpacing the 6 percent growth in 2017 the afore mentioned april 2019 world bank report had further revealed the upsurge in south asia was driven by stronger economic conditions in the united states and a pick up in oil prices which had a positive impact on outward remittances from some gcc countries remittances grew by more than 14 percent in india where a flooding disaster in kerala likely boosted the financial help that migrants sent to families in bangladesh remittances showed a brisk uptick in 2018 15 percent the report had stated the bank estimates that officially recorded annual remittance flows to low and middle income countries reached 529 billion in 2018 an increase of 9 6 percent over the previous record high of 483 billion in 2017 global remittances which include flows to high income countries reached 689 billion in 2018 up from 633 billion in 2017 the overall increase was driven by a stronger economy and employment situation in the united states and a rebound in outward flows from some gulf cooperation council gcc countries and the russian federation excluding china remittances to low and middle income countries 462 billion were significantly larger than foreign direct investment flows in 2018 344 billion the global average cost of sending 200 remained high at around 7 percent in the first quarter of 2019 according to the world bank s remittance prices worldwide database banks were the most expensive remittance channels charging an average fee of 11 percent in the first quarter of 2019 post offices were the next most expensive at over 7 percent remittance fees tend to include a premium where national post offices have an exclusive partnership with a money transfer operator this premium was on average 1 5 percent worldwide and as high as 4 percent in some countries in the last quarter of 2018 advantages of foreign remittances a steady flow of remittances helps struggling nations counter and fight the current account deficit problems because the influx of this money from migrant workers especially provides great relief to bearish economies amidst financial crises and economic downturns it goes without saying that countries with diversified migration destinations are likely to have more sustainable remittance flows remittances can certainly boost aggregate demand and thereby spur economic activity disadvantages of high costs of money transfers millions of low skilled migrant workers are vulnerable to recruitment malpractices including exorbitant recruitment costs the ongoing de risking practices through banks have involved the closure of the accounts of some remittance service providers hence driving up remittance costs expensive modes of sending money from abroad reduces the benefits of migration economic acceleration helps increase remittances prudent policies in this context coupled with growth in economic activity in countries where foreign workers are earning have paid dividends for many countries on the world map for example after posting 22 percent growth in 2017 remittances to europe and central asia grew an estimated 11 percent to 59 billion in 2018 satisfactory growth in economic activity during 2018 had increased outbound remittances from poland russia spain and the united states major sources of remittances to the region smaller remittance dependent countries in the region such as the kyrgyz republic tajikistan and uzbekistan benefited from the sustained rebound of economic activity in russia ukraine the region s largest remittance recipient received a new record of more than 14 billion in 2018 up about 19 percent over 2017 this surge in ukraine also reflects a revised methodology for estimating incoming remittances as well as growth in neighboring countries demand for migrant workers remittances flows into latin america and the caribbean grew 10 percent to 88 billion in 2018 supported by the strong u s economy mexico continued to receive the most remittances in the region posting about 36 billion in 2018 up 11 percent over the previous year remittances to the middle east and north africa grew 9 percent to 62 billion in 2018 the growth was driven by egypt s rapid remittance growth of around 17 percent beyond 2018 the growth of remittances to the region is expected to continue albeit at a slower pace of around 3 percent in 2019 due to moderating growth in the euro area remittances to sub saharan africa grew almost 10 percent to 46 billion in 2018 supported by strong economic conditions in high income economies

argentina s bright young hope new york judging by his appointment of a first rate economist to his cabinet as minister of economy argentina s new president alberto fernández is off to a good start in confronting his country s economic problems martin guzmán with whom i have frequently collaborated in recent years is among the world s leading experts on sovereign debt and the problems it can cause making him the right person in the right place at the right time photo depositphotos com foto4440 after completing his phd at brown university under peter howitt co author with philippe aghion of seminal work in modern growth theory guzmán obtained a coveted position at columbia university where he forged an academic career and became an influential expert on crucial policy debates at the domestic and global level he has testified before the us congress on puerto rico s debt crisis and spoken at the united nations about the need for a better international system for resolving sovereign debt crises in recent years he has divided his time between new york and argentina where he is a professor of macroeconomics at the university of buenos aires when former president mauricio macri took office his economic team openly admitted that while they had inherited many problems they started with one major advantage a low level of debt they gambled on a set of policies making for instance untimely and unnecessarily large cuts in export taxes paying off old defaulted debt to so called vulture funds with unconscionably high returns and taking on new high interest long term dollar denominated debt all in the hope that market friendly signals would lead to a rush of growth spurring foreign investment even at the time i thought it was a foolhardy gamble the rest is history it didn t work out and as matters went from bad to worse macri compounded the mistakes more borrowing including a 57 billion program with the international monetary fund austerity misguided sterilization efforts to prevent inflation which built up a debt overhang the worst of all possible worlds was soon at hand more inflation reaching almost 60 in the current year higher unemployment already at double digits and rising and the re imposition of the exchange controls the removal of which macri had hailed at the outset of his administration as the cornerstone of his economic policy as a result fernández inherits a far worse economic situation than macri confronted higher inflation higher unemployment and now a debt beyond argentina s ability to service doubling down on a failed policy won t work nor will returning to what preceded it that s why it s so important that fernández has appointed a knowledgeable brilliant economist who combines youthful energy with a wisdom well beyond his 37 years given the mess that macri has handed fernández there are no magic bullets it is easier to say what not to do as fernández has put it one doesn t solve a problem of excessive debt by taking on more debt nor does one solve a problem of recession and unemployment by imposing more austerity which in every recession always leads to more economic contraction the reality is that there will be no substantial private sector flows in the immediate future no matter what policies the government enacts but argentina must husband its limited resources devoting them to reigniting the economy one hopes that the multilateral development banks will provide countercyclical lending for investment projects that spur growth and poverty alleviation under macri poverty has once again grown enormously to more than 35 of the population there is enormous potential tourism for example boomed after the last major devaluation argentina has first rate universities and large numbers of highly educated entrepreneurial people bondholders won t necessarily be thinking however of argentina s people or of the country s long run potential many of them will be thinking only of the short run gains from squeezing argentina into more austerity they will spin a story about a profligate country that lived beyond its means once again even though they encouraged macri in his misconceived policies and gave him the money that led argentina into its current debt crisis presumably they knew there was a risk that s why they demanded and received such high interest rates some may be more thoughtful and understand that restoring argentina s debt service capacity depends on economic recovery in recent months many other countries in the region have confronted political instability and economic turmoil it is in no one s interest that argentina be added to that list we should celebrate the orderly transfer of power and the commitment on all sides to maintain and defend democracy we should also celebrate the shared vision that any effective economic program must involve not only shared sacrifice but also shared prosperity when the fruits of that program are achieved fernández with guzmán appears to be formulating a program of moderation avoiding the extremes of the past unlike macri s agenda the fernández program is not based on big gambles and wishful thinking it is based on the hard realities of the situation that he has inherited it represents argentina s best chance to achieve gradual restoration of growth obviously the more assistance the international community can provide the faster and more robust the recovery will be project syndicate 1995 2019
caracas venezuela last christmas devastated venezuela saw shortages of everything from tinsel to toilet paper this year the socialist government has given a weary nation an unexpected holiday gift a dose of the free market president nicolás maduro is making tentative moves away from the socialist policies that once regulated the prices of basic goods heavily taxed imports and restricted the use of the u s dollar as a result the south american nation s economic free fall is beginning to decelerate the national inflation rate still the world s highest has slowed from a blistering 1 5 million last year to a relatively breezy annualized rate of 15 000 percent the changes might be temporary and amount largely to an economic band aid there are no signs for instance of a larger strategy to reverse the agricultural land grabs and company seizures that helped lay the groundwork for one of the worst economic implosions of modern times advertisement but as the new measures take hold once empty store shelves have overflowed this holiday season with beef chicken milk and bread albeit at prices so high that a significant segment of the population is actually worse off more moneyed venezuelans however are flocking to dozens of newly opened specialty stores including at least one fake walmart brimming with stacks of cheerios slabs of italian ham and crates of kirkland signature olive oils much of it bought and shipped in containers to venezuela from costco and other bulk retailers in miami maduro remains deadlocked in a political standoff with opposition leader juan guaidó and his backers in washington who have ratcheted up pressure to force his ouster but u s sanctions against venezuela do not appear to have crimped surging imports mostly because they prevent americans from doing business with only the government not private venezuelans the government had been unable to restart the economy any other way so it s doing what the people want by giving in to the free market said ricardo cusano president of fedecamaras venezuela s chamber of commerce the socialists are still in power he said but they have lost the ideological war advertisement plagued by hyperinflation and economic collapse depressed venezuelans dubbed last dec 25 the christmas without lights a day largely bereft of the traditional holiday bunting and toys for children but as the economy begins to show modest signs of life particularly in the relative bubble of caracas the capital there have been visible changes on the streets meager christmas markets opened to peddle baubles to a slightly more optimistic populace more holiday decorations popped up inside stores along with proprietors say more parents buying toys and clothing for children the capital is suffering its worst traffic jams in years as car owners with greater access to imported spare parts drag long out of commission vehicles back onto clogged roads the eased restrictions have made the holiday season merrier for a small minority of rich venezuelans many of whom live in mansions behind high walls in eastern caracas advertisement there were things you just couldn t get dishes you just couldn t make said pablo gianni manager of anonimo a lavish new caracas eatery that opened this month complete with a glass walled wine cellar stocked with shelves of four figure vintages of dom pérignon but now it s like legal contraband he said they re letting everything in the changes taking shape here are the product of a combination of factors for years the government strictly limited the use of the u s dollar long portrayed as an instrument of yanqui imperialism but last year the government freed the exchange rate and more broadly legalized dollar transactions it also eliminated massive import taxes on a host of goods but those measures have begun to work through the economy really only in recent months as the government has taken the further step of abandoning attempts to control retail prices stocks of bread chicken and beef that once sold for nearly nothing are now being sold at market rates at least partly normalizing farm production and sales through supply chains just as importantly there are simply far more dollars in the venezuelan economy now about 4 5 million venezuelans have fled starvation and poverty in recent years creating a global diaspora that collectively sent 3 5 billion in remittances this year more than triple the amount two years ago according to ecoanalitica a caracas based economic analysis firm in addition economists say the economy is awash in dollars from illegal mining drug trafficking and other illicit activities by some estimates there are three times as many dollars in circulation as bolivars creating a de facto dollarization of the economy that is stabilizing inflation last month even maduro seemed to hail the almighty dollar advertisement i don t see the process they call dollarization as bad he said in nationally televised comments it can aid the recovery of the productive areas of the country and the functioning of the economy share this article share across venezuela mechanics and electricians engineers and architects are increasingly charging in greenbacks more companies are supplementing their employees salaries with u s currency collectively economists say 60 to 70 percent of families here are now regularly receiving some dollars buying even some venezuelans of more modest means a merrier christmas this year last year was very hard for us there was practically no christmas yelitza mineros 33 said as she eyed the prices in dollars at a caracas toy store with her 7 year old son and 3 year old daughter her husband a mechanic began earning in dollars a few months ago she said giving them the extra money they needed to buy new clothes for their children advertisement her son rodrigo held up a spider man action figure with a big grin as she spoke this year we re doing better and we can get them their toys she said that gives me a lot of joy venezuela remains deeply mired in the worst economic crisis in modern latin american history years of chronic mismanagement and to a lesser extent u s sanctions including an oil embargo have severely damaged the lifeblood of the economy petroleum production venezuelans including residents of the relatively shielded capital are struggling with worsening gasoline shortages lingering blackouts and broken state hospitals and more food on store shelves doesn t mean everyone can eat in western caracas for instance a grocery store that last year sold price controlled products and suffered from shortages was now well now stocked with goods ranging from imported motorcycle helmets to diet coke but with two chicken thighs at 1 70 and butter at 2 in a nation with a minimum wage of 6 a month the aisles were mostly devoid of shoppers for the poorest venezuelans with no access to dollars life is harder mariutka oropeza a 54 year old woman who lives with her three adult children in a small apartment in eastern caracas has struggled to afford medicines and treatment for her arthritis hypertension and uterine cancer she was shocked recently to discover that one of her new prescriptions was going for 70 a box well out of reach for a family with a household income of 30 a month advertisement her family once survived by waiting in hours long lines for regulated goods but now that the government has stopped enforcing fixed prices a bag of cornmeal that once cost her 25 cents now costs four times that amount it s painful oropeza said people say oh we are doing a little better because many of them receive remittances from their families abroad but oh my god we are not doing better at all i remember when this government started

the consequences of trump s and the republicans excessive corporate giveaways and their failure to improve the lives of ordinary working americans are becoming clearer by the day for a century the gop has been bankrolled by big business and wall street trump wants to keep the money rolling in his signature tax cut two years old last sunday has helped u s corporations score record profits and the stock market reach all time highs to spur even more corporate generosity for the 2020 election trump is suggesting more giveaways chief of staff mick mulvaney recently told an assemblage of ceos that trump wants to go beyond his 2017 tax cut trump also wants to expand his working class base in rallies and countless tweets he claims to be restoring the american working class by holding back immigration and trade incumbent republicans and gop candidates are mimicking trump s economic nationalism as trump consigliore stephen bannon boasted recently we ve turned the republican party into a working class party keeping the gop the party of big money while making it over into the party of the working class is a tricky maneuver especially at a time when capital and labor are engaged in the most intense economic contest in more than a century because so much wealth and power are going to the top armed with deductions and loopholes america s largest companies paid an average federal tax rate of only 11 3 percent on their profits last year roughly half the official rate under the new tax law the lowest effective corporate tax rate in more than eighty years yet almost nothing has trickled down to ordinary workers corporations have used most of their tax savings to buy back their shares giving the stock market a sugar high the typical american household remains poorer today than it was before the financial crisis began in 2007 trump s giant tax cut has also caused the federal budget deficit to balloon even as pretax corporate profits have reached record highs corporate tax revenues have dropped about a third under projected levels this requires more federal dollars for interest on the debt leaving fewer for public services workers need the trump administration has already announced a 4 5 billion cut in food stamp benefits that would affect an estimated 10 000 families many at the lower end of the working class the administration is also proposing to reduce social security disability benefits a potential blow to hundreds of thousands of workers the tax cut has also shifted more of the total tax burden to workers payroll taxes made up 7 8 percent of national income last year while corporate taxes made up just 0 9 percent the biggest gap in nearly two decades all told taxes on workers were 35 percent of federal tax revenue in 2018 taxes on corporations only 9 percent trump probably figures he can cover up this massive redistribution from the working class to the corporate elite by pushing the same economic nationalism tinged with xenophobia and racism he used in 2016 as steve bannon has noted the formula seems to have worked for britain s conservative party but it will be difficult this time around because trump s economic nationalism has hurt american workers particularly in states that were critical to trump s 2016 win manufacturing has suffered as tariffs raised prices for imported parts and materials hiring has slowed sharply in pennsylvania michigan and other states trump won and in states like minnesota that he narrowly lost the trade wars have also harmed rural america which also went for trump by reducing demand for american farm produce last year china bought around 8 6 billion of farm goods down from 20 billion in 2016 a new tentative trade deal calls for substantially more chinese purchases meanwhile health care costs continue to soar college is even less affordable and average life expectancy is dropping due to a rise in deaths from suicide and opioid drugs like fentanyl polls show most americans remain dissatisfied with the country s direction the consequences of trump s and the republicans excessive corporate giveaways and their failure to improve the lives of ordinary working americans are becoming clearer by the day the only tricks left to trump and the republicans are stoking social and racial resentments and claiming to be foes of the establishment but bigotry alone won t win elections and the detritus of the tax cut makes it difficult for trump and the gop to portray themselves as anti establishment this has created a giant political void and an opportunity democrats have an historic chance to do what they should have done years ago create a multi racial coalition of the working class middle class and poor dedicated to reclaiming the economy for the vast majority and making democracy work for all
mergers acquisitions likely as bank consolidation beckons one of the high points of 2019 was the disclosure by central bank of nigeria cbn governor godwin emefiele that there would be new banking consolidation during his second term in office the cbn sees new capital for banks option as the key to getting the lenders ready to meet customers credit needs and contribute to economic growth as the clock ticks into 2020 banks are expected to be ready for anything including a deadline for new capital base which could trigger new mergers and acquisitions collins nweze reports calls for banks to go for higher capital base have been on for years and have in many cases succeeded a new demand for bank recapitalisation was announced earlier in the year by central bank of nigeria cbn governor godwin emefiele he said in the next five years we intend to pursue a programme of recapitalising the banking industry so as to position nigerian banks among the top 500 in the world banks will therefore be required to maintain higher level of capital as well as liquid assets in order to reduce the impact of an economic crisis on the financial system before that in april precisely a voice seeking higher capital for nigerian banks sounded loud and clear from a distant land it was in faraway united states of america that the international monetary fund imf asked nigerian banks to recapitalise and strengthen their capital bases if they must compete locally and globally director imf monetary and capital markets department tobias andrian had at the african session of the april 2019 spring meetings of the world bank advised nigeria to seek higher capital for its lenders through recapitalisation and also tackle rising non performing loans npls in the sector andrian s advice got a backing when emefiele unfolded the bank s policy direction for the next five years with recapitalisation of banks on the top list bank recapitalisation is expected to see lenders raising their capital base above the n25 billion minimum level instituted in 2004 the cbn boss also plans to lead the economy into double digit growth single digit inflation 12 billion non oil exports by 2023 and raising financial inclusion to 95 per cent level by 2024 while retaining the managed float exchange rate cbn guidelines stipulate that regional banks must have a minimum paid up capital of n10 billion national banks n25 billion and banks with international operations n50 billion speaking further on the recapitalisation plans emefiele said the 2004 banking industry recapitalisation which increased banks capital base from n2 billion to the current n25 billion had weakened he plans to pursue a programme that will make nigerian banks rank among the top 500 in the world according to the cbn governor s view the n25 billion capital base of commercial banks has weakened substantially stakeholders views on recapitalisation of banks president chairman of council chartered institute of bankers of nigeria cibn uche olowu said the cbn has industry data and right information on why banks should recapitalise he said recapitalisation would provide more funds for the lenders to business especially consumer credit mortgage finance which are yet to be given the desired consideration by banks he said recapitalisation would give banks the power to take advantage of opportunities in the industry and lend more to real sector he said many banks have eroded their capital due to high level of npls and that recapitalisation would present a new lifeline for the banks for me recapitalisation of the banks is fine i have no problem with that rather i see opportunities that it presents to the economy and the lenders it will be a healthy development for the banks to recapitalise normally from time to time there is always need for recapitalisation of the banking sector for banks with regional operations recapitalisa tion will enable them to raise the needed capital for more coverage olowu said also speaking president association of bureau de change operators of nigeria abcon aminu gwadabe said that recapitalisation of banks will help the lenders remove toxic assets in their balance sheets that make it difficult for them to lend he also said that the exercise will help the lenders attract new foreign and local investors that will provide the needed capital for them to take bigger roles including investment in infrastructure he said the banks are not lending as expected and recapitalisation of their operations will provide them with the right capital mix to lend to larger segments of the economy former executive director keystone bank richard obire said recapitalisation of the banks has both the yes and no answers he said the high industry npls is real and that a number of banks even the tier 1 lenders are affected by the rise in bad loans according to him if the big banks are groaning under the burden of npls what happens to the smaller banks he said banks capitals have been eroded in 2004 when the recapitalisation took place what the exchange rate was at that time is different from what it is at present he said that there has been capital erosion in the banks due to naira depreciation the no side is that it will bring challenge for the banks raising capital now may not be easy if the the macro environment is upbeat so will be investors gross domestic product gdp growth still sluggish and raising money in such economy will be difficult he said obire said that clearly more capital is required for the banks to be strong and do what they are expected to do he also said that recapitalisation of the bank can also lead to drop in quality of service adding that as the banks get bigger customers complaints resolution will take longer time obire said banks can only have more money to grow their businesses in a growing economy according to him every business has the ambition to grow year on year but that would be difficult to achieve under a shrinking economy to him all forward looking banks should look at what would protect their revenues by identifying and focusing on the healthy side of the economy also an economist okechukwu unegbu said the pronouncement by the cbn governor could send panic into the system if not properly managed unegbu who is presently the ceo of maxifund investments and securities plc said beyond recapitalisation the issue of human capital in the banking industry should also be given attention we must understand that everything is not about money coming into the system we should be talking about capacity building and the type of personnel behind these institutions these days a lot of bankers don t have career path most bankers don t have job satisfaction today the level of fraud in the system is on the rise and it is a result of deficiency in capacity building so it is not only money that we should be talking about if these institutions don t have the required capacity and you throw money into them they would probably be out of business before you know it he added banks face declining loan demand head research coronation merchant bank limited guy czatoryski said that lending is a principal responsibility offered by banks to their customers he said the challenge with loan advancement in nigeria is that only few people come forward to borrow given the slow growth in the gross domestic product gdp czatoryski said the challenge with the banks is that loan demand has dropped significantly in recent years he said weak loan demand is the biggest challenge facing banks and will continue next year due to poor economic growth he explained that regular bank customers that were borrowing excessively before hardly come back for loans given the poor state of the economy czatoryski said that weak borrowing now witnessed among bank customers has nothing to do with cost of the loans if you tell me that loans are expensive today they have been expensive in the last 10 years but that did not stop people from taking loans it is not a question of pricing of the loans but weak demands for products the industry is weak it is very important not to confuse that he said he also said weak demand for loans was affecting the banks profitability and ability to grow
recent global uncertainties have arisen mainly because of accentuating trade tensions between the two super powers the usa and china india s stock market has been moving up and down in sync with the ups and downs of trade tensions these for the time being have hopefully subsided thanks to the phase one trade deal between the two powers expected to be signed early january the us has agreed to reduce some tariffs in exchange for big jump in chinese purchases of american farm products beijing is opening its oil telecom and power markets wider to private competitors already steps by both have been initiated in keeping with the spirit of the interim trade deal however the present calm is not likely to prevent the us china trade war rhetoric to keep on emerging again and again what has been accomplished is a tentative phase one deal complete details are still not fully known on positive note the tariffs that were to come into effect on 15 december did not materialise a lot depends upon two factors durability of the understanding that there would be no further major escalation of the turmoil and the trade tensions do not get complicated with technology issues certainly the situation has become better as compared to the environment during sept oct of 2019 the world s two biggest economies have been exchanging blows for over a year and a half with tariffs impacting hundreds of billions of dollars in two way trade over time tensions have embraced a whole host of issues other than trade like technology national security human rights data disputes digital taxation currency issues and control over natural resources the ongoing confrontation is basically about which country is globally more powerful technology supremacy and global trade tensions have been most prominent that could disturb future global balances also true that several chinese tech companies want to work with american companies to promote technological developments international trade has been slowing more than global economic slowdown former rbi governor y v reddy sees in the trade wars a collapse of the global trading system evidence of which is obvious like the wto continuously losing its relevance in a way what the wto has been doing over the years the super powers have started emulating the same in their bilateral relationships global slowdown has been mainly due to rising protectionism across countries more damaging development is the tension spilling into business and economics of nations thereby entrenching global slowdown including emerging market slowdown axing of the bill gates nuclear reactor in china was a trade war warning implying about a five year setback for technology and scientific research us companies doing business in china fear living with

despite both the economic survey 2019 and nda ii s 1st budget clearly establishing the importance of india s exports for attaining its ambitious 5 trn economy mark by 2022 the trade numbers are not showing any promise india can still tap ample opportunities from thawing of the usa china trade barriers with the globe moving towards a multipolar world india stands a chance of playing a decisive role india has been late in grabbing emerging opportunities arising from the accentuating cold war due to its economy lacking global competitiveness it needs to move fast through innovative policies and clear focus on infrastructure development indian authorities have started speedily putting in place reforms practically in all sectors of the economy alongwith a holistic perspective on critical economic problems so as to be able to capitalize on the trade war though india gained about 755 mn in additional exports to the usa in first half of 2019 because of the trade war a lot of ground still remains to be covered urgently major policy decisions aimed at making the economy globally competitive include concessions for tesla and 323 other firms wanting to shift out of china to india and providing the firms land and other facilities to set up factories in india a number of laws are getting focused attention that would change the way india does business insolvency banking code is considered one of the biggest success stories towards de clogging the economic system from ill effects of stressed assets there are solid plans to boost select indian exports that have suffered due to competitive exports from smaller economies like bangladesh and vietnam india could be the single largest beneficiary if the likely multilateral cut in service trade restrictions materialise india could become an ideal candidate to get businesses from both china and the usa but only if it plays its cards well it is trying hard to accelerate its economic growth with planned mega shopping

growth providing employment for a bulging workforce and poverty alleviation india can learn from china s response to its deteriorating terms of trade which has implemented reforms to enhance its select industries to get globally integrated india apart from fast forwarding its reform process may need some new dosage of alertness and nimbleness inbuilt into its policy so that it meaningfully adjusts with the changing global landscape though ease of doing business eodb rank improvement up 14 places to rank of 63 is a good sign india needs to do more such as focussing more on actual implementation of policies announced and ushering in cost competitiveness direction and approach towards eodb needs to be reviewed government also needs to institute policy measures to nurture

spread the love the economy is imploding and mostly as a result of the zimbabwe dollar losing value as the country approaches the new year newsday business reporter tatira zwinoira nd talks to the reserve bank of zimbabwe governor john mangudya jm about plans to stabilise the currency nd a lot of businesses are optimistic about the first quarter of next year what do you think of it jm that is why we are trying to put our house in order so that the new year will be a better year for everyone and that we will continue with the spirit of love and discipline so that the economy will move on that pace nd in trying to examine what went wrong with the zimbabwean dollar as it has failed to maintain its value what are your thoughts pertaining the issue from the authorities side as reserve bank jm i am not sure how the zimbabwe dollar failed to maintain its value that question presupposes that the authorities had made a statement on where the zimbabwe dollar should settle where are you coming from yourself when you say it s not getting its value it sounds as if someone had told you that the zimbabwe dollar was supposed to settle at a certain level which is not true tz as the reserve bank did you not have your own expectations jm that is what i am saying that i do not rely on hear say which does not have evidence for you to say it has failed it means you already had your own objectives over the issue it seems you had your own predetermined level that you thought the zimbabwe dollar was supposed to settle the best way of saying it is as follows the economy is in transition and that transition will liberalise under the tsp transitional stabilisation programme we liberalised zimbabwe s exchange rate prices and because we liberalised them it means the exchange rate was supposed to find its level within the market because it is market determined in that market determination our mandate objective and key focus area was to make sure that the zimbabwe dollar remains stable at a certain level where it would have to settle so the issue now is on how to make it settle where it is so that it would not pass through the effects of inflation if you ask me whether we believe the exchange rate is now stable we will say yes because over the past two months up to december the exchange rate has been stable tz that s quite true because i have seen on the interbank parallel market the exchange rate is now relatively stable but jm the next question should be what are we going to do to ensure that the rate of the exchange remains where it is as it is relatively stable so there are two deliverables that we are going to work on that is to ensure that the reserve monetary target is maintained at levels that do not put pressure on the exchange rate and we are also ensuring that we will seek finance through the letters of cash that we are issuing out so that the demand for foreign currency would reduce on the interbank market by the use of debt instruments called letters of credit a letter of credit is a debt instrument which makes it easy to plan for cash flow in a manner that helps to reduce pressure on the exchange rate and therefore for bulk imports like fuel maize and cooking oil by so doing we are looking for foreign currency through letters of credit to ensure that there is not too much money on the market by making sure that we target our reserve money growth in that way it will pass through the benefits to the inflation so that prices are also stable so our main job going forward into 2020 is to maintain price stability through the exchange rate stability and to ensure that the public has confidence in the local currency that has to simultaneously harness as much foreign currency as possible from the people in the diaspora and the exporters so that we improve on the efficiency and the utilisation of the foreign currency in zimbabwe tz but governor don t you think you should be focusing on trying to get foreign currency reserves to stabilise the currency because unlike in america where they use just the confidence in the economy to stabilise their currency there is no confidence in this economy you have said it yourself so many times so don t you think where there is no confidence in the economy something should be backing our economy other than the reserve money that you are targeting jm we are saying the same language here we are saying we are managing our local currency so that we do not put pressure on foreign currency exchange because people have got much money in the market because they increased the rate of the currency and we are also saying simultaneously we are going to harness as much foreign currency as possible from the diasporas and the exports by giving them incentives so that the exporters continue to export besides the market will become competitive and at the same time the people in the diaspora will bring in money i am talking about an open market economy tz so how much foreign currency do you think as the central bank will be enough to sustain our local currency jm let me put it this way once the confidence levels are high and if there is discipline in the market and the love within the zimbabweans which is the fundamental principle of life with that i can tell you that the economy will become so simple and grafted towards the growth in the new year i am hopeful that what the zimbabweans have gone through over the year which has been difficult cannot continue under that context this economy requires about us 520 million on a monthly basis for us to be comfortable with our economy and its earning around us 490 million if you get more money from the exports and that from the diaspora and if we get more money from the letters of credit and money from the finance we can bridge that gap of about us 30 million very easily our foreign currency situation is very stable and fundamentals on the foreign side are not that bad tz as the reserve bank how are you going to build confidence in the economy in 2020 jm we are going to focus on a number of things in the new year we want to lower to under 5 by year end the month on month inflation tz and with the exchange rate what level are you targeting jm we are expecting a stable exchange rate but that one is very difficult to measure but we expect it to be stable in view of what we are doing on the foreign exchange side to make sure that as i said we harness as much foreign currency from within the diaspora and from the lines of credit number two under key focus areas which we are working on as a bank is to enhance financial sector responsibility to make sure people have got confidence in the financial services sector and that the money remains safe and sound the third one is to enhance the functioning of zimbabwe s financial markets in support of economic resilience and development the fourth as i was saying is to ensure they zimbabweans have confidence in the local dollar currency and that the cash is disbursed in such a manner that we minimise the premiums that are being charged and that money is available when money is required because that instils confidence in the banking public that they will get their money as and when they need it tz how are you going to be spending your christmas if you don t mind me asking jm right now i am in the office trying to make sure that the economy can keep going forward my philosophy in business tatira as you know in whatever circumstance that you are going through keep moving forward whatever the circumstances so i want to urge zimbabweans to know that while we went through difficulties in 2019 we need to keep moving news day share this share twitter facebook email linkedin reddit pinterest whatsapp like this like loading
uranium outlook 2020 prices to rise as demand grows and supply falls the uranium spot price started the year just above us 29 a pound with the promise that the price could move higher once a section 232 decision was passed down however us president donald trump s lack of any actionable items in his ruling and the delay for utilities to come to the market drove the price lower by the end of may the price had sunk to its half year low of us 23 67 in mid july bolstered by the release of the trump administration s section 232 ruling which established an exploratory committee to examine the domestic nuclear fuel cycle the price was able to rally from the us 24 range to us 26 31 that price momentum was short lived when the deadline for the nuclear fuel working group nfwg report was extended in mid october the price sank to its lowest point for 2019 at us 23 51 despite the uranium spot price stagnating for much of 2019 analysts and sector participants remain certain the energy fuel will make bold gains once the price starts to move uranium outlook 2020 section 232 looms large stalls price the most challenging aspect of 2019 has been the lack of price direction despite the positive market fundamentals said daniel major ceo of goviex tsxv gxu otcqb gvxxf a uranium explorer focused on africa despite declining inventories shortening of uncovered contracts and a supply deficit the uranium price showed no spark of interest for the majority of the year however things are starting to look up in q4 he added the main catalyst for the price growth will be a reduction in production and inventory earlier this year kazatomprom the national uranium producer of kazakhstan reported a q1 production decline and cameco tsx cco nyse ccj the largest uranium producer has dramatically reduced its stockpiles following the temporary closure of its flagship mine mcarthur river in saskatchewan major like many in the sector had hoped the uranium strength displayed early in the year would carry through we had been expecting uranium to get to at least us 30 by the end of 2019 he said however the impact of section 232 and the follow up nfwg had a wider impact on utility buying than we would have predicted this issue was further highlighted as the price failed to respond to the very positive world nuclear association nuclear fuel report for energy fuels tsx efr nyseamerican uuuu a us producer and one of the companies that helped get the section 232 investigation into foreign uranium launched the opaqueness the investigation brought into the sector was something the company had not accounted for the section 232 and subsequent us nuclear fuel working group created a ton of uncertainty in the uranium market said curtis moore vice president of marketing and corporate development the lack of clarity was further compounded in mid november when the trump administration rescinded waivers allowing iran to work with russia to advance the former s nuclear fuel sector moore pointed out that the decision which went into effect on december 15 could impact the country s ability to import much needed uranium and nuclear fuel from russia it has been difficult for us and our shareholders of course said moore but it must be extremely challenging for nuclear utilities which have multibillion dollar investments to fuel it is becoming increasingly clear that us utilities have taken on too much geopolitical risk with their uranium and nuclear fuel supplies while moore is sympathetic to the needs of domestic utility companies he does note that they need to be cognizant of the role they played in adding risk to the cycle so when suppliers from geopolitical foes like russia kazakhstan china and elsewhere approach us utilities with cheap subsidized nuclear material we can see why it is alluring to sign up he said they have largely themselves to blame for creating exposure to these risks by not supporting a healthy domestic nuclear fuel cycle in mid december news spread that the nfwg had passed its non public report on to the president and recommended some sort of domestic quota uranium outlook 2020 more ways to access the market while the industry spent the vast majority of 2019 in a state of limbo there was growth in the uranium exchange traded fund etf sector in may canada s first uranium etf was launched by horizons etfs management under the ticker symbol hura the hura etf aims to capitalize on the growing need for clean carbon free energy while mercenary geologist mickey fulp doesn t participate in the etf market he does appreciate the exposure the products offer the uranium industry i d rather play specific equities instead of playing a basket that is dependent on a higher uranium price said fulp in a november 24 interview etfs may not be fulp s cup of tea but he did note that royalty companies may be a good investment in the future there is uranium royalty it s going to go public at some point he said fulp was correct and the royalty company launched its initial public offering on december 12 under the ticker tsxv urc in early december the north shore global uranium mining index etf was launched under the ticker arca urnm uranium outlook 2020 smrs lighting the future as the number of etfs that give investors exposure to the sector grows the market itself is expected to expand as small modular reactors smrs become less of a concept and more of a tangible deployable product smrs are designed to be compact and efficient producing enough energy to power a small town or a mining operation they can also be scaled up to meet growing demand and produce no carbon emissions in the opinion of fission uranium s tsx fcu otcqx fcuuf jeffrey mushaluk smrs can help change the narrative around nuclear energy one that is often fraught with fear and tension the nuclear power industry does a terrible job marketing itself and has such a bad stigma and part of that is deserved from the reactor build outs that happened before and came in way over budget and took too much time mushaluk said at the new orleans investment conference in november what government is going to want to commit that type of capital right now for something like that that could have political push back so we really welcome new technologies like smrs to come in and it could change the entire industry in early december premiers from ontario new brunswick and saskatchewan met to discuss the integration of smrs technology into the respective provincial power grids ontario saskatchewan and new brunswick agreed today to work together to explore new cutting edge technology in nuclear power generation to provide carbon free affordable reliable and safe energy while helping us unlock economic potential across canada including rural and remote regions reads a statement about the meeting the three leaders signed a memorandum of understanding pledging to work jointly on the innovation development and deployment of smrs in their provinces the decision for canada s most populous province ontario and two other major economic hubs to commit to advancing the smr agenda is the first of its kind in the world and a potential catalyst for other countries i would hope that canada would take the lead on this they certainly have based on what they have done over the last 10 years they have a leg up on small modular reactors compared to most other entities said fulp still the mercenary geologist remains on the fence about how quickly any deployment will occur in the great white north but i m always skeptical about these sorts of things in canada because what i see happening with mining projects and with pipelines regardless the discussion itself helps raise the profile for smrs and nuclear energy as a whole uranium outlook 2020 the year ahead despite 2019 being less fruitful in terms of price growth many of the analysts and companies we spoke to over the year remain confident the uranium market will make gains in 2020 and beyond we understand that the major producers have been running inventories to very low levels which has kept a lid on prices said craig parry ceo president and director of isoenergy tsxv iso otcqx isenf a junior focused on advancing its athabasca basin project with this selling now largely out of the way the market is in serious undersupply prices have started to rise once again in the later months of 2019 and are well set for a serious rally during 2020 2020 could be the year for uranium noted parry who also highlighted a return of investor interest helping to bolster the market us based producer energy fuels is also optimistic about the year ahead and the final decisions around section 232 we think there will be increased market activity as utilities try to mitigate their exposure to the iran sanctions said moore he noted there are already some indicators pointing to a stronger market in the months ahead we ve also seen conversion and enrichment prices rise which could be leading indicators signaling higher u3o8 prices and of course the underlying market fundamentals appear to be strong according to western uranium vanadium cse wuc otcqx wstrf a near term producer developing projects in colorado and utah the market will move regardless of a decision absent an industry positive trade outcome we still expect a strong 2020 owing to cumulative producer supply cuts increasing global demand recognition of the future supply gap and the increased contracting needed to fulfill record levels of uncontracted nuclear fuel requirements said cfo robert klein the bottom line is that the era of uranium sale prices being set by price insensitive state owned enterprises will likely come to an end in 2020 higher prices are required to re initiate long term contracting that incentivizes the new production needed to meet future nuclear reactor requirements he added in july at the sprott natural resource symposium rick rule of sprott tsx sii otc pink spoxf told the investing news network that he foresees 2020 being a positive year for the energy fuel but the truth is that when uranium markets move the impacts on uranium stocks are more dramatic than any other stocks in the resource sector when the uranium price does move the anticipation that you ll see from investors crowding into the few remaining uranium stocks on the planet i think will be very dramatic said rule his sentiment was echoed in november by lobo tiggre ceo of louis james llc at the new orleans investment conference the price of uranium could literally double at that time of contract signing because the incentive price that you and i talked about is more than twice and sometimes three times the current spot price he said i can t say when but when it does happen we are going to see a very sudden and dramatic rise in uranium prices and that is going to be extremely bullish for the uranium companies don t forget to follow us

bulk imports like fuel maize and cooking oil by so doing we are looking for foreign currency through letters of credit to ensure that there is not too much money on the market by making sure that we target our reserve money growth in that way it will pass through the benefits to the inflation so that prices are also stable so our main job going forward into 2020 is to maintain price stability through the exchange rate stability and to ensure that the public has confidence in the local currency that has to simultaneously harness as much foreign currency as possible from the people in the diaspora and the exporters so that we improve on the efficiency and the utilisation of the foreign currency in zimbabwe tz but governor don t you think you should be focusing on trying to get foreign currency reserves to stabilise the currency because unlike in america where they use just the confidence in the economy to stabilise their currency there is no confidence in this economy you have said it yourself so many times so don t you think where there is no confidence in the economy something should be backing our economy other than the reserve money that you are targeting jm we are saying the same language here we are saying we are managing our local currency so that we do not put pressure on foreign currency exchange because people have got much money in the market because they increased the rate of the currency and we are also saying simultaneously we are going to harness as much foreign currency as possible from the diasporas and the exports by giving them incentives so that the exporters continue to export besides the market will become competitive and at the same time the people in the diaspora will bring in money i am talking about an open market economy tz so how much foreign currency do you think as the central bank will be enough to sustain our local currency jm let me put it this way once the confidence levels are high and if there is discipline in the market and the love within the zimbabweans which is the fundamental principle of life with that i can tell you that the economy will become so simple and grafted towards the growth in the new year i am hopeful that what the zimbabweans have gone through over the year which has been difficult cannot continue under that context this economy requires about us 520 million on a monthly basis for us to be comfortable with our economy and its earning around us 490 million if you get more money from the exports and that from the diaspora and if we get more money from the letters of credit and money from the finance we can bridge that gap of about us 30 million very easily our foreign currency situation is very stable and fundamentals on the foreign side are not that bad tz as the reserve bank how are you going to build confidence in the economy in 2020 jm we are going to focus on a number of things in the new year we want to lower to under 5 by year end the month on month inflation tz and with the exchange rate what level are you targeting jm we are expecting a stable exchange rate but that one is very difficult to measure but we expect it to be stable in view of what we are doing on the foreign exchange side to make sure that as i said we harness as much foreign currency from within the diaspora and from the lines of credit number two under key focus areas which we are working on as a bank is to enhance financial sector responsibility to make sure people have got confidence in the financial services sector and that the money remains safe and sound the third one is to enhance the functioning of zimbabwe s financial markets in support of economic resilience and development the fourth as i was saying is to ensure they zimbabweans have confidence in the local dollar currency and that the cash is disbursed in such a manner that we minimise the premiums that are being charged and that money is available when money is required because that instils confidence in the banking public that they will get their money as and when they need it tz how are you going to be spending your christmas if you don t mind me asking jm right now i am in the office trying to make sure that the economy can keep going forward my philosophy in business tatira as you know in whatever circumstance that you are going through keep moving forward whatever the circumstances so i want to urge zimbabweans to know that while we went through difficulties in 2019 we need to keep moving like this like loading
the economy is imploding and mostly as a result of the zimbabwe dollar losing value interview tatira zwinoira the economy is imploding and mostly as a result of the zimbabwe dollar losing value as the country approaches the new year newsday business reporter tatira zwinoira nd talks to the reserve bank of zimbabwe governor john mangudya jm about plans to stabilise the currency nd a lot of businesses are optimistic about the first quarter of next year what do you think of it jm that is why we are trying to put our house in order so that the new year will be a better year for everyone and that we will continue with the spirit of love and discipline so that the economy will move on that pace nd in trying to examine what went wrong with the zimbabwean dollar as it has failed to maintain its value what are your thoughts pertaining the issue from the authorities side as reserve bank jm i am not sure how the zimbabwe dollar failed to maintain its value that question presupposes that the authorities had made a statement on where the zimbabwe dollar should settle where are you coming from yourself when you say it s not getting its value it sounds as if someone had told you that the zimbabwe dollar was supposed to settle at a certain level which is not true tz as the reserve bank did you not have your own expectations jm that is what i am saying that i do not rely on hear say which does not have evidence for you to say it has failed it means you already had your own objectives over the issue it seems you had your own predetermined level that you thought the zimbabwe dollar was supposed to settle the best way of saying it is as follows the economy is in transition and that transition will liberalise under the tsp transitional stabilisation programme we liberalised zimbabwe s exchange rate prices and because we liberalised them it means the exchange rate was supposed to find its level within the market because it is market determined in that market determination our mandate objective and key focus area was to make sure that the zimbabwe dollar remains stable at a certain level where it would have to settle so the issue now is on how to make it settle where it is so that it would not pass through the effects of inflation if you ask me whether we believe the exchange rate is now stable we will say yes because over the past two months up to december the exchange rate has been stable tz that s quite true because i have seen on the interbank parallel market the exchange rate is now relatively stable but jm the next question should be what are we going to do to ensure that the rate of the exchange remains where it is as it is relatively stable so there are two deliverables that we are going to work on that is to ensure that the reserve monetary target is maintained at levels that do not put pressure on the exchange rate and we are also ensuring that we will seek finance through the letters of cash that we are issuing out so that the demand for foreign currency would reduce on the interbank market by the use of debt instruments called letters of credit a letter of credit is a debt instrument which makes it easy to plan for cash flow in a manner that helps to reduce pressure on the exchange rate and therefore for bulk imports like fuel maize and cooking oil by so doing we are looking for foreign currency through letters of

officials planning the gold line extension east of azusa were shocked last year when bids came in much higher than expected the bids that arrived last year to extend the gold line east of azusa were hundreds of millions of dollars higher than officials had expected the price tag ballooned 38 to 2 1 billion to stay within budget the foothill gold line construction authority was forced to truncate the line postponing the construction of two stations and three miles of track we were totally shocked chief executive habib balian said it was way way off from what our estimates were advertisement the unexpected cost increase is not unique to the gold line it is one of at least three planned rail projects in southern california facing a significant funding gap underscoring the challenges of the region s ambitious plan to build nearly two dozen major projects over the next four decades with billions of dollars still to secure and pressure building to open as many lines as possible before the 2028 summer olympics in los angeles metropolitan transportation authority officials are beginning to explore new funding models including long term deals with the private sector to fund and operate lines board members and the public want things now now now said jerard wright a policy manager at the los angeles county business federation what we re seeing at metro is a realization that they can t deliver everything at once without some significant help metro is juggling a grueling schedule of at least five ribbon cuttings in the next decade including the westside subway the downtown regional connector subway and a rail line in the san fernando valley los angeles mayor eric garcetti and other metro board members are pushing to finish four more major projects before 2028 a transit line through the sepulveda pass a rail line to artesia an eastside extension of the gold line and a green line extension to torrance accelerating those lines would require 3 3 billion more for construction interest on an additional 10 billion in debt financing and 1 2 billion to operate the lines over a decade officials said the figures assume the project costs won t rise advertisement the lines would need to start heavy construction by 2023 to have a chance of opening before the olympics said rick clarke metro s chief program management officer a planned transit line through the sepulveda pass could cost at least 13 billion depending on metro s design and route choices opening the line by 2028 would require accelerating its measure m construction schedule by at least five years tunneling through the santa monica mountains to build a subway line would provide the fastest travel time but would significantly add to the risk of cost overruns metro is also planning a rail line between downtown l a and artesia following the path of an old freight railway through huntington park downey and paramount the 20 mile line has 4 billion secured there are two route options each of which has a price tag of about 5 8 billion leaving a funding gap of 1 8 billion the rail building boom is driven by measure m the sales tax increase that voters approved three years ago and its predecessor measure r approved in 2008 the taxes provide billions of dollars for rail construction but not enough to pay for the projects outright advertisement metro is pursuing what chief executive phil washington has described as a finance lasagna with layers of money provided through tax revenue and bonds and grants from federal and state agencies he said they will also turn to the private sector for construction financing an arrangement that s common in europe but new for an agency that has historically relied on bond financing under a typical public private partnership a firm would be hired to build operate and maintain a line for as long as 35 years washington said the model could work on the sepulveda pass and artesia lines he said the companies hired to build the line would provide some capital during construction which would address metro s immediate funding gaps in return metro would pay the contractor a lump sum when the line opens and a monthly fee for the next three decades or so the payments would probably carry a higher interest rate than the bond market but washington said that could be canceled out by the benefit of transferring risk for cost overruns to a private company and saving on inflation by opening the project more quickly the contract would include a structure of fines and bonuses to ensure the line was delivered on time officials said advertisement they don t get paid unless the project is delivered and it s meeting the performance outcomes we care about said joshua schank metro s chief innovation officer you get more value for your money los angeles international airport is using a public private partnership to build the people mover train that will carry riders between a metro station and the airport s central terminal area the contractor will receive 4 9 billion to build the project and operate it for 25 years with stiff penalties baked in for overruns and delays critics say that by setting optimistically low budgets metro has promised more projects than it delivered despite funding from four sales tax increases since 1980 what we ve seen metro do in the last 30 years is put together very optimistic construction plans discover that costs were much higher then scramble to find resources said james moore a usc engineering professor they don t really expect to be able to build projects at the costs they predict because they never have before metro borrowed heavily in the bond market in the 1980s and 1990s to build the county s first modern rail lines by the late 1990s debt service was metro s single largest expense consuming more than 30 of the operating budget advertisement less than a decade ago metro officials were forced to trim revenue estimates for measure r the sales tax approved in 2008 after the economy turned sour falling retail sales sliced more than 5 billion from the tax s estimated revenue over its three decade lifespan from 40 billion to about 35 billion metro officials say measure m was not designed to cover every cost building lines more quickly they say will save money in the long run and provide a greater public benefit we are meeting or exceeding what we took out to voters washington said adding that though the 2028 acceleration plan is important it was not part of what the public approved not every region not every program can say that the rail building boom in los angeles county comes during a tight construction market that is partly of its own making lax is undergoing a multibillion dollar renovation an nfl stadium is rising in inglewood and seattle officials are adding to the market pressure by embarking on their own ambitious multi decade transit construction program the surge in construction coupled with low unemployment and stricter immigration policies has made it difficult for contractors to hire qualified workers which has driven up wages the associated general contractors of america said that was the case on the gold line s san gabriel valley extension which faced a perfect storm of economic uncertainty and rising costs when bids came back in the summer of 2018 said balian the gold line authority s ceo advertisement the construction authority had planned on building light rail tracks from the current terminus in azusa to montclair instead the line s terminus will be in pomona the shorter first phase of the line is slated to open in 2025 two years ahead of the original date if officials can find 465 million by october the contractor will keep building east adding stations in claremont and montclair balian said to balian the unexpected budget problems were a reminder that measure m s vast list of projects schedules and budgets should not be seen as set in stone after all he said you never know what s going to happen

by elyar najmehchi b a chinadaily com cn updated 2019 12 25 09 48 visitors pass the wedoctor booth during the flex future life expo 2019 in hangzhou zhejiang province different sectors of the healthcare industry are growing at a rapid pace in china the reasons for this are multiple urbanization an aging population a continuous rise in wages and living standards for chinese citizens as well as more innovation in high tech and broader access to healthcare this article will take a look at some of the main trends in the chinese healthcare and medical sector and observe the potential of some of its most promising developments especially in the fields of health technology and medical artificial intelligence the outlook will analyze the chinese government s efforts and unique approach in promoting and improving healthcare and conclude why it might be one of china s most promising sectors for 2020 and beyond a look at health statistics china constantly improving if we look at the statistics for recent years we can observe an increase in spending for healthcare as well as a drastic improvement in the overall health of chinese citizens indicating not only the economic growth of the healthcare sector but also its efficiency per capita healthcare spending in china has risen from 42 in 2000 to 398 in 2016 according to world bank statistics however it has simultaneously remained comparatively low in relation to gdp per capita which is considerably small at 4 9 percent compared to the us at 17 percent in 2017 for example china has passed japan in total healthcare spending in 2016 with 574 billion compared to japan s 469 billion and passed the us in hospital beds per 1 000 persons with 3 8 for china and only 2 9 in the us according to oecd data compared with 2 75 in 2011 china is seeing some of the fastest growth in this category putting it ahead of countries such as norway canada and the uk this is in part due to chinese government policies such as increased funding for hospitals in recent years the numbers of doctors per 1 000 inhabitants has also been continuously rising in china since 2002 from 1 13 to 2 01 in 2017 according to oecd health data putting it above the east asia and pacific average a similar development is seen in the number of nurses per 1 000 inhabitants with 1 in 2004 rising to 2 7 in 2017 the maternal mortality rate is equally impressive for china having plunged from 97 per 100 000 births in 1990 to only 27 in 2015 according to the world bank life expectancy has also continuously risen in china according to statistics for the united nations world population prospects the current life expectancy for china in 2019 is 76 79 years a 0 22 percent increase from 2018 putting it significantly higher than the world average life expectancy of about 72 years the un projects a similar rate of increase for the rest of the 21st century for china why china s healthcare sector is growing the growing healthcare sector is in many aspects a byproduct of china s recent economic rise several hundred million people were lifted out of poverty in recent decades which led to overall higher living standards and affordability of healthcare services this in turn created the continuously rising life expectancy with more people reaching retirement age than ever before which further increases the demand for healthcare services however the effect of government policies and measures is not to be underestimated in this trend within the last two decades china has benefited from large scale reforms in the fields of medical infrastructure and insurance as well as the opening up of its healthcare market focus has been laid on not only developing urban areas but also continuously making healthcare more accessible in rural china boosting development and the number of hospitals doctors and medical equipment however the most important contributor might be that according to the state council china has created the world s largest network for basic medical insurance accessible for all and formed a healthcare service system encompassing both urban and rural areas by the end of 2016 basic medical insurance has reached over 1 3 billion citizens nationwide accounting for more than 95 percent of the total population the world bank also described china s achievement in extending health insurance to 1 3 billion people as an unparalleled accomplishment all these factors in turn create an interesting market for foreign investors in the healthcare field also although the medical industry is growing fast in china the demands for further healthcare services are growing even faster this makes it even more attractive to investors as it opens up new market opportunities the government has understood this and initiated measures to boost foreign investment in this field manufacturers of raw materials for the production of vaccines and cell therapy drugs and those investing in medical institution services can now access preferential treatment such as tax incentives streamlined procedures or discounted land prices furthermore the chinese government introduced a new law permitting foreign investors to hold a 100 percent ownership of private hospitals in 2014 in 2019 subsectors of both the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries were added to the 2019 foreign investment national encouraged catalogue some promising industries for 2020 and beyond health tech and medical ai to tackle overcrowded hospitals in an innovative way the government made it clear that health technology is a strategic area of development for china it features heavily in both the 13th five year plan 2016 2020 and its healthy china 2030 strategy in april 2018 the state council also issued new guidelines to promote internet based healthcare encouraging medical institutions to leverage internet based technologies to improve the efficiency of medical services china s large number of smartphone and internet users 700 million today provides large potential for more technology use in healthcare subsectors everything can be done via apps in the future also called fingertip medical treatment data from the national health commission showed that in 2017 china s online healthcare market reached 32 5 billion yuan 4 6 billion 45 87 percent higher than that of the previous year industry experts estimated the market will grow to 90 billion yuan by 2020 tencent for example has already been steadily building up a network of participating hospitals over 38 000 medical facilities as of 2017 where users can book doctor s appointments through their wechat intelligent healthcare to avoid long lines at medical facilities following their health checkup patients can also conveniently access their medical reports through wechat and pay for their medical bills also china is a frontrunner in the field of medical ai in 2018 alibaba s health unit introduced ai software that could help interpret ct scans and an ai medical lab to help doctors make diagnoses deep learning algorithms trained through the data of billions can analyze medical outputs like ct and mri images with a close to 100 percent accuracy tencent established the ai medical innovation system or aimis an ai powered diagnostic medical imaging service available so far in over 10 hospitals across the country the method works as follows images of patient tissue are fed into the ai software which can then determine in under four seconds whether the body looks normal inflamed or cancerous in 2017 a robot named xiaoyi passed the written stage of china s national medical licensing examination sifting through more than 2 million medical records and 400 000 articles it achieved 456 points 96 points above a passing grade in the future a robot like this could help make an initial diagnosis by scanning data it would relieve some of the burden of doctors instead of replacing them currently over 130 chinese companies are working on applying ai in healthcare with their number expected to grow even further in 2020 outlook china s healthcare sector has big potential for 2020 and beyond we can observe that the government is supporting the growth of the industry by encouraging investment and innovation on the one hand but also initiating measures to keep a lid on individual healthcare costs this double approach contributes to ensuring the fulfillment of the sector s future potential the healthcare market is expected to reach 198 billion yuan 28 59 billion in 2026 increasing tenfold from 2016 according to china briefing however it s important to assure that with the growth of the healthcare sector medical treatment remains affordable for all citizens a failure in affordability of healthcare can be partly observed in the united states although the us has an economically strong medical and healthcare industry on the one hand the lack of regulations and government measures for the sector on the other hand has led to it having the highest per capita spending on healthcare in the world by far reaching almost 10 000 in 2016 compared to china s 400 this amounts to 17 percent of the us gdp outperforming second place switzerland with 12 percent and china with 5 percent by an incredible margin contributing to a growing inequality and medical discrimination in the country this shows how important it is to assure that with the growth of the healthcare sector medical treatment remains affordable for all citizens it is the government s duty to further regulate the market in china through innovative measures and policies the programs of healthy china 2020 and healthy china 2030 for example both outline comprehensive health care reforms which aim to ensure universal healthcare access as well as improve the overall health situation of all chinese people new innovative technologies as those described in this article seem to be a promising element to achieve equality access in remote areas as well as effectiveness and affordability in healthcare in the future and should thus be further promoted and funded also the development should be continued to further increase the number of doctors and quality hospitals also outside of the major cities distributing healthcare more evenly among the population and preventing overcrowding of hospitals the development toward a fair and effective healthcare system has been largely successful in china for citizens but also the business sector as the statistics indicate we can observe that through extensive government measures china has managed to progress in three fields simultaneously to ensure stable growth of the healthcare sector reducing overcrowding of hospitals increasing quality of healthcare and at the same time keeping healthcare affordable and accessible to all if this current development is maintained or even increased china will be well on track for 2020 and beyond the author is a masters degree student in economy and society of east asia at the

visitors pass the wedoctor booth during the flex future life expo 2019 in hangzhou zhejiang province different sectors of the healthcare industry are growing at a rapid pace in china the reasons for this are multiple urbanization an aging population a continuous rise in wages and living standards for chinese citizens as well as more innovation in high tech and broader access to healthcare this article will take a look at some of the main trends in the chinese healthcare and medical sector and observe the potential of some of its most promising developments especially in the fields of health technology and medical artificial intelligence the outlook will analyze the chinese government s efforts and unique approach in promoting and improving healthcare and conclude why it might be one of china s most promising sectors for 2020 and beyond a look at health statistics china constantly improving if we look at the statistics for recent years we can observe an increase in spending for healthcare as well as a drastic improvement in the overall health of chinese citizens indicating not only the economic growth of the healthcare sector but also its efficiency per capita healthcare spending in china has risen from 42 in 2000 to 398 in 2016 according to world bank statistics however it has simultaneously remained comparatively low in relation to gdp per capita which is considerably small at 4 9 percent compared to the us at 17 percent in 2017 for example china has passed japan in total healthcare spending in 2016 with 574 billion compared to japan s 469 billion and passed the us in hospital beds per 1 000 persons with 3 8 for china and only 2 9 in the us according to oecd data compared with 2 75 in 2011 china is seeing some of the fastest growth in this category putting it ahead of countries such as norway canada and the uk this is in part due to chinese government policies such as increased funding for hospitals in recent years the numbers of doctors per 1 000 inhabitants has also been continuously rising in china since 2002 from 1 13 to 2 01 in 2017 according to oecd health data putting it above the east asia and pacific average a similar development is seen in the number of nurses per 1 000 inhabitants with 1 in 2004 rising to 2 7 in 2017 the maternal mortality rate is equally impressive for china having plunged from 97 per 100 000 births in 1990 to only 27 in 2015 according to the world bank life expectancy has also continuously risen in china according to statistics for the united nations world population prospects the current life expectancy for china in 2019 is 76 79 years a 0 22 percent increase from 2018 putting it significantly higher than the world average life expectancy of about 72 years the un projects a similar rate of increase for the rest of the 21st century for china why china s healthcare sector is growing the growing healthcare sector is in many aspects a byproduct of china s recent economic rise several hundred million people were lifted out of poverty in recent decades which led to overall higher living standards and affordability of healthcare services this in turn created the continuously rising life expectancy with more people reaching retirement age than ever before which further increases the demand for healthcare services however the effect of government policies and measures is not to be underestimated in this trend within the last two decades china has benefited from large scale reforms in the fields of medical infrastructure and insurance as well as the opening up of its healthcare market focus has been laid on not only developing urban areas but also continuously making healthcare more accessible in rural china boosting development and the number of hospitals doctors and medical equipment however the most important contributor might be that according to the state council china has created the world s largest network for basic medical insurance accessible for all and formed a healthcare service system encompassing both urban and rural areas by the end of 2016 basic medical insurance has reached over 1 3 billion citizens nationwide accounting for more than 95 percent of the total population the world bank also described china s achievement in extending health insurance to 1 3 billion people as an unparalleled accomplishment all these factors in turn create an interesting market for foreign investors in the healthcare field also although the medical industry is growing fast in china the demands for further healthcare services are growing even faster this makes it even more attractive to investors as it opens up new market opportunities the government has understood this and initiated measures to boost foreign investment in this field manufacturers of raw materials for the production of vaccines and cell therapy drugs and those investing in medical institution services can now access preferential treatment such as tax incentives streamlined procedures or discounted land prices furthermore the chinese government introduced a new law permitting foreign investors to hold a 100 percent ownership of private hospitals in 2014 in 2019 subsectors of both the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries were added to the 2019 foreign investment national encouraged catalogue some promising industries for 2020 and beyond health tech and medical ai to tackle overcrowded hospitals in an innovative way the government made it clear that health technology is a strategic area of development for china it features heavily in both the 13th five year plan 2016 2020 and its healthy china 2030 strategy in april 2018 the state council also issued new guidelines to promote internet based healthcare encouraging medical institutions to leverage internet based technologies to improve the efficiency of medical services china s large number of smartphone and internet users 700 million today provides large potential for more technology use in healthcare subsectors everything can be done via apps in the future also called fingertip medical treatment data from the national health commission showed that in 2017 china s online healthcare market reached 32 5 billion yuan 4 6 billion 45 87 percent higher than that of the previous year industry experts estimated the market will grow to 90 billion yuan by 2020 tencent for example has already been steadily building up a network of participating hospitals over 38 000 medical facilities as of 2017 where users can book doctor s appointments through their wechat intelligent healthcare to avoid long lines at medical facilities following their health checkup patients can also conveniently access their medical reports through wechat and pay for their medical bills also china is a frontrunner in the field of medical ai in 2018 alibaba s health unit introduced ai software that could help interpret ct scans and an ai medical lab to help doctors make diagnoses deep learning algorithms trained through the data of billions can analyze medical outputs like ct and mri images with a close to 100 percent accuracy tencent established the ai medical innovation system or aimis an ai powered diagnostic medical imaging service available so far in over 10 hospitals across the country the method works as follows images of patient tissue are fed into the ai software which can then determine in under four seconds whether the body looks normal inflamed or cancerous in 2017 a robot named xiaoyi passed the written stage of china s national medical licensing examination sifting through more than 2 million medical records and 400 000 articles it achieved 456 points 96 points above a passing grade in the future a robot like this could help make an initial diagnosis by

share soviet troops invaded afghanistan 40 years ago today on 25 december 1979 two days later on 27 december they toppled and killed amin s khalqi s government which had called for the troops and had assumed they had come for their rescue the resulting occupation that would last for more than ten years became the last direct soviet involvement in a hot war in the global cold war of that era what was meant to be a relatively short and limited regime change operation ended up changing history it became part of a larger configuration of events that led to the downfall of the soviet union and its dominance in eastern europe and what at the time was described as the end of history the end of the cold war and the final triumph of liberal democracy an illusion that has become obsolete in afghanistan armed conflict did not end with the soviet withdrawal making afghans the main victims of this war aan s thomas ruttig reminds us of the unfolding events and the history they were part of in an improvised intervention during a cabinet meeting in january of this year us president donald trump gave us his version of the soviet involvement in afghanistan during what cnn described as a freewheeling speech he said russia used to be the soviet union afghanistan made it russia because they went bankrupt fighting in afghanistan the reason russia was in in afghanistan was because terrorists were going into russia they were right to be there the problem is it was a tough fight and literally they went bankrupt although after 40 years people not directly involved in the events can probably be forgiven for not remembering all the details it is useful to revisit the actual decisions that led to the intervention as well as the wider context which made this a crucial period in world history our current era has been strongly shaped by what happened in that crucial year coups assassinations invasion the prelude to the soviet intervention started on 27 april 1978 when a group of left wing military officers toppled and murdered afghan president muhammad daud and most of his family in a coup d état the government they put in power was dominated by the until then clandestine pro soviet people s democratic party of afghanistan pdpa five years earlier daud himself a member of the royal family had overthrown a monarchy that had existed since 1747 some of the officers who later killed him in 1978 had supported him then the pdpa s policies from land reform to enforced co education was met with resistance among the population the resistance was spontaneous at first but soon grew and became better organised and led by mujahedin organisations that operated from pakistan and iran with support of their regimes aleksandr lyakhovskiy a former high ranking soviet officer who helped prepare the operation that unseated amin quoted a soviet intelligence estimate in a paper for the wilson center in 2007 as saying that by the autumn of 1979 there were 40 000 mujahedin operating against government troops in 12 of the 27 provinces of the country and that the afghan army weakened by repression turned out to be incapable of crushing the antigovernment movement the pdpa leader nur muhammad tarakai a teacher from ghazni province as chairman of the revolutionary council and now the head of state reacted violently and had tens of thousands of opponents real or imagined who were put into prison or who disappeared aan background here he and later amin repeatedly asked the soviet leadership under leonid breshnev for direct military support moscow rejected all these requests at the same time from the beginning there were major internal power struggles in the faction ridden pdpa one of its deputies babrak karmal a former member of parliament was exiled in a mountain resort in what was then czechoslovakia after having been accused of preparing another coup in november 2019 frud bezhan published a fascinating story about this episode on radio free europe radio liberty s gandhara blog more photos here in september 1979 tarakai s self styled pupil and remaining deputy hafizullah amin also a teacher from paghman near kabul ordered the murder of his ustad and took power the killing of tarakai shocked the soviet leadership and by late 1979 they had grown even more suspicious of amin as documents published in january 2019 showed he had not kept them abreast of his peace overtures to mujahedin leaders particularly his co tribal gulbuddin hekmatyar a kharoti pashtun like himself hekmatyar s backer pakistan and even the us embassy in kabul us documents that were declassified in january 2019 also confirmed the meetings with amin for the us and soviet documents see here amin opponents also turned soviet attention to earlier inner pdpa allegations that amin had had contacts with the cia while studying in the us which had prevented him from becoming part of the party leadership in the 1960s moscow feared amin could bring about a change in the political line of afghanistan in a direction which is pleasing to washington as contemporary soviet documents published in october 2019 put it there had been precedents of leaders switching over to the west in the global cold war earlier in the 1970s including president anwar al sadat of egypt and muhammad siad barre of somalia the situation for the new regime in the meantime had worsened by late 1979 according to lyakhovskiy the rebels had managed to launch combat operations in 16 of the then 27 provinces they controlled laghman kunar paktia and paktika completely except for the provincial centres according to lyakhovskiy p8 by late november 1979 the soviet leadership had already decided to remove amin from power by force however the removal was initially not meant to happen by means of a full scale military intervention on 4 december a high ranking kgb officer was sent to kabul to prepare the operation to remove amin from power two days later the soviet politbureau decided to back the operation by sending a detachment to afghanistan of about 500 men in uniforms which would not reveal an affiliation with the soviet armed forces officially this was framed as a response to amin s request for a battalion to defend his residence and the bagram air base this so called muslim battalion was dressed in afghan uniforms among these soldiers was a 22 man special purpose detachment from the soviet intelligence service the kgb they were housed in three villas in kabul rented by the soviet embassy according to lyakhovskiy on 7 december babrak karmal and another pdpa leadership member anahita ratebzad karmal s mistress were flown clandestinely into bagram base on board of a civilian tu 134 aircraft belonging to moscow s intelligence chief yuri andropov the soviets had earlier brought both of them from czechoslovakia to the ussr in bagram they were put under the protection of kgb paratroopers according to lyakhovskiy another group of dissident pdpa leaders nur ahmad nur muhammad aslam watanjar who had participated in daud s 1973 coup sayed muhammad gulabzoy and asadullah sarwari who had stayed in bulgaria were brought to bagram separately soon lyakhovskiy wrote the soviet leadership was leaning more and more to the opinion that without soviet troops it would be difficult to create the conditions for removing amin on 8 december two options were worked out by the so called small politbureau in party leader leonid brezhnev s private office remove amin from power using the kgb s capabilities and transfer power to karmal if this didn t work then send a certain number of troops to the dra for these purposes defence minister dmitri ustinov was ordered to put 75 80 000 soviet troops on standby for temporary deployment in afghanistan apart from brezhnev only four other persons participated in the meeting intelligence chief andropov defence minister dmitri ustinov foreign minister andrey gromyko and chief ideologue mikhail suslov 1 on 12 december the politbureau of the central committee of the communist party of the soviet union as this body was officially called in full 2 signed a hand written politbureau decision no p 176 125 titled concerning the situation in a see below according to lyakhovskiy he record was signed by all cc cpsu politburo members present at the meeting prime minister alexei kosygin was absent later in his description of events he puts present in quotation marks and adds that only the inner circle had signed the document actually no politbureau meeting had even taken place and all other members were asked to sign post factum the short two paragraph document is generally considered the only available document of the decision to invade afghanistan 3 however it is framed in extremely general terms it abbreviates using only afghanistan s first letter and refers only to ideas and measures most likely the ones discussed on 8 december the implementation of which it approved lyakhovskiy wrote that the fact that it was handwritten and signed by brezhnev and he had not even involved a scribe in order to keep it top secret proves the extraordinary significance of the document here the wilson centers transcription of the document top secret special folder chaired by cde l i brezhnev present suslov m a grishin v v kirilenko a p pel she a ya ustinov d f chernenko k u andropov yu v gromyko a a tikhonov n a ponomarev b n cc cpsu decree no 176 125 of 12 december concerning the situation in a approve the ideas and measures set forth by andropov yu v ustinov d f and gromyko a a authorize them to introduce amendments of non essential nature in the course of the execution of these measures questions requiring the decision of the cc should be expeditiously submitted to the politburo the implementation of all these measures is to be entrusted to cdes andropov yu v ustinov d f and gromyko a a charge cdes andropov yu v ustinov d f and gromyko a a to keep the cc politburo informed on the status of the execution of the outlined measures cc secretary brezhnev no 997 1 page however lyakhovskiy also argued that this decision might not have been meant to be a final one about a full scale military invasion he wrote anyone who is remotely familiar with the process of preparing documents and their evaluation at cc cpsu politburo meetings knows that there should also be a note with the suggestions of andropov ustinov and gromyko in fact such a note does not exist on the basis of these facts and the development of the situation in afghanistan i will take a risk and offer another version at this meeting the politburo discussed questions regarding the conduct of the operation to remove amin using forces already in afghanistan if the operation had been conducted successfully it would not have been necessary to introduce soviet troops into the dra indeed further attempts were made to get rid of amin without a larger military operation between 14 and 16 december soviet snipers tried to shoot him on his way to or from the arg but unsuccessfully so they did not come into a position to shoot as amin s convoy was too well protected according to lyachovskiy another attempt on his life with poisoned pepsi cola also failed after these failures karmal and the other pdpa leaders were brought back temporarily to safety in tashkent now in independent uzbekistan amin had apparently still not noticed that something was wrong and was still asking for soviet military forces lyakhovskiy quotes soviet documents according to which amin told the kgb representative in kabul in meetings on 12 and 17 december 1979 what boiled down to the following the present afghan leadership will greet the presence of the soviet armed forces at a number of strategically important points in the northern regions of the dra amin said that the forms and methods of extending military aid should be determined by the soviet side the ussr can have military garrisons wherever they want the ussr can take under guard all facilities where there is soviet afghan collaboration the soviet troops could take dra lines of communications under guard on the day of the second meeting 17 december orders were given for the raid on amin s palace on 19 december 1979 he relocated his residence from the arg in central kabul to taj bek palace at the urging of his soviet advisers according to late afghan historian hassan kakar afghanistan the soviet invasion and the afghan response 1979 1982 berkeley los angeles and london 1995 pp21 2 kakar wrote the new palace had originally been the seat of the reformist king amanullah 1919 29 before amin became the head of state the khalqi government had spent more than one billion afghanis approximately 20 million to repair the palace and make it a suitable seat for his predecessor nur mohammad taraki president amin moved into it at the urging of his soviet advisers but tapa e tajbeg situated on a mound two miles south of the city could easily be attacked should the soviet union decide to do so kakar wrote further that amin wanted to be away from the old palace which reminded him of the many bloody events that had taken place there it had been the place where tarakai tried to get rid of him and perhaps kill him in september and where he had tarakai murdered in the following month about the following events lyakhovskiy wrote on 22 and 23 december ambassador tabeyev informed amin that his request for soviet troops to be sent to afghanistan had been granted in full in moscow they were ready to begin deployment on 25 december amin expressed gratitude to the soviet leadership and gave instructions to the dra armed forces general staff to give assistance to the deploying troops when thousands of airborne soviet soldiers landed in kabul and bagram and started crossing the land border in the north at 3pm moscow time on 25 december 4 moving toward herat and shindand airbase in western afghanistan and to kunduz pul e khumri and the salang pass in the northeast amin still assumed they had come to help him two days later at a reception on 25 december 1979 he told those present according to lyakhovskiy soviet divisions are already on their way here paratroopers are landing in kabul everything is going beautifully i am in constant touch by telephone with cde gromyko and we are discussing together how to best formulate the information to the world about the extension of soviet military aid in the late afternoon of the same day a last attempt to poison amin failed soviet doctors who were present but had not been informed of the coup plan kept amin alive then soviet special forces stormed his residence in kabul s taj beg palace and shot him dead 5 karmal was flown in yet again from the soviet union and was installed as the new leader it still remains an open question who made the final decision to enter and act with such a large force it seems clear however also from lyakhovskiy s account that the soviet leadership was thinking not only about the mujahedin threat to the government but also that it expected and experienced stiff resistance from the afghan armed forces the khalqis the pdpa faction amin had belonged to still had the majority in the army and police officer corps despite earlier purges which had also turned some of the faction s members such as watanjar gulabzoy and sarwari against him it was only to be expected that they would vehemently oppose the takeover by karmal s rival parcham faction this is confirmed by artemy kalinovsky another leading writer on the soviet occupation of afghanistan who wrote p51 the months following the invasion were key in turning the intervention into a decade long war following the use of a limited contingent of soviet troops to put down an afghan army mutiny at the beginning of january soviet forces were drawn into skirmishes with increasing frequency the international situation had influenced the decision making lyakhovskiy wrote that andropov and ustinov told brezhnev in early december that a western oriented afghanistan could become a base for short range nuclear missiles targeted at the ussr according to kalinovsky p50 it was this that had finally convinced the hesitant breshnev remarkably the politbureau decision concerning the situation in a was taken on the same day that the nato council in brussels approved the deployment of new us medium range cruise missiles and pershing 2 missiles in western europe turning tides the soviet military intervention initially planned to be a limited regime change operation turned into a large scale invasion that lasted ten years by spring 1980 there were 81 000 soviet soldiers in afghanistan in 1986 this number had grown to 120 000 and finally there were around 100 000 troops before withdrawals started in mid 1988 according to rodric braithwaite in his 2011 book afganzy pp122 283 after the troops negotiated departure in february 1989 continued military and financial support first soviet and then briefly russian when the soviet union disintegrated kept the afghan regime alive for another three years when russian president boris yeltsin deemed the engagement to have become too costly and stopped it in early 1992 the afghan regime crumbled one of the pdpa factions handed power to the mujahedin who moved into kabul without encountering any resistance on 28 april 1992 unfortunately this was not the end of the war but the rest is better known history trump s assertion that the soviet union went bankrupt fighting in afghanistan a view held by many afghans too is only part of the truth 6 in his 2019 book zeitenwende 1979 als die welt von heute begann turning of times 1979 when the world of today began munich 2019 not available yet in english german historian frank bösch argues that it was a series of international events in 1979 including the events in afghanistan that ultimately undermined the soviet union and the soviet led eastern bloc led to the rise of political islam with violent terrorist jihadism at its fringes and established a new multipolar world the year 1979 had started with the islamic revolution in iran the new regime under ayatollah rohullah khomeini followed a doctrine that included export of the revolution through support to likeminded groups in the region the soviets initially expected the new strongly anti us regime would be an ally later that year saddam hussain took power in iraq and soon led his country into war with iran on 20 november 1979 the first day of the islamic 15th century a group of armed millennial islamists led by juhaiman al otaibi stormed and occupied the grand mosque of mecca the group called itself al ikhwan the brothers as a reference to an uprising against the saudi dynasty in the 1920s they proclaimed a mahdi declared the end of the world and the victory of true islam over jahiliyya ignorance which in their eyes included the western allied saudi regime after a siege of two weeks the group was brutally defeated with the help of french special forces advisers otaibi and 67 others were publicly executed according an authoritative book on the events the siege of mecca by former afghanistan correspondent of the wall street journal yaroslav trofimov london 2007 the brutal repression alienated many muslims from the saudi regime among them osama ben laden some of them would find a common cause and an arena for their fight in soviet occupied afghanistan outside the region pope john paul ii s visit to his homeland poland in june 1979 boosted the country s anti communist opposition led by the independent solidarność trade union as well as opposition groups elsewhere in eastern europe in mid 1979 the start of margaret thatcher s premiership in the united kingdom started a conservative wave in the west in the us ronald reagan would follow soon on 12 december 1979 the nato responded to the deployment of soviet nuclear middle range missiles in eastern central europe with the above mentioned so called double track decision deployment of nuclear missiles and bomber airplanes able to carry nuclear weapons in western central europe this brought europe and the world to the brink of nuclear war the soviet invasion of afghanistan just two weeks after the nato decision ended the east west détente which witnessed a period of almost a decade during which east west relations had become less confrontational due to disarmament measures thus direct soviet military involvement in afghanistan in the midst of global tensions internationalised an internal political conflict which so far had been mainly over the question of whether to modernise or not at which pace and in which form over time the anti soviet resistance in afghanistan became stronger and received support from the west most islamic countries and china however it was pakistan s islamist military dictatorship under zia ul haq that made sure that non islamist groups were excluded from this support as a result what started as a largely national resistance movement over time morphed into a resistance dominated by jihadi armed groups in 1979 the soviet leadership like everybody else was still unable to read the signs of the time boosted by the establishment of new socialist regimes in angola mozambique ethiopia and south yemen during the 1970s and by the victory of the sandinistas in nicaragua in 1979 they were buoyed by dreams of a constantly expanding socialist world system spanning from moscow to maputo and havana to hanoi this historic optimism may well have contributed to moscow s hubris to decide to invade afghanistan ten years later the financial burden of the new arms race had brought the soviet union into economic crisis new soviet leader mikhail gorbachov decided to cut costs first in eastern europe mainly by curbing the subsidised oil and gas and other mineral resources and then increasingly in afghanistan until yeltsin decided to completely cut afghanistan off historian bösch wrote the run of history is often moulded by coincidence but mostly by long term changes which appear compacted at certain points of time and take on rapid speed in the year of 1979 rapid changes culminated in many spheres and regions in this sense one can talk about a 1979 turn of the times in which our present world began to emerge that is definitely the case for afghanistan as a single country too the soviet war in afghanistan would only be the first stage of a now 40 year long armed conflict with changing and shifting participants and alliances and severe consequences above all for afghans according to a 2005 report of the afghanistan justice project he soviet occupation brought about a shift in tactics in the war soviet forces assassinated amin and installed babrak karmal from the rival parcham wing of the party in his place aware of the need to build support for the party the soviets ended the mass slaughter of intellectuals religious leaders and others and instead adopted more systematic means of intelligence gathering and more selective targets of repression the secret police the khidamati ittila at i dawlati state information services or khad engaged in widespread summary executions detentions and torture of suspected mujahidin resistance supporters in the countryside the bombing became routine and indiscriminate devastated the countryside killed tens of thousands and drove five million afghans into exile casualty figures of the soviet phase of the war alone are estimated to have been between 800 000 and two million dead 7 and three million wounded the latter mainly civilians 6 4 million one third of the pre war population turned into refugees the largest refugee population in the world for many years up to and until the syrian war that started in 2015 two million internally displaced then there are the consequences from mass traumatisation to the devastated economy and destruction of the social fabric 8 in 1989 the afghan economist ghanie ghaussy calculated that afghanistan s direct material and potential grand national product losses and the damages to the capital stocks and infrastructure from the soviet war could be estimated at approximately 13 billion us dollars agricultural and industrial output declined to 40 to 60 per cent of the production level of the pre invasion period the impact on individual lives has been staggering and is sometimes subsumed by the suffering that followed in the next phases of the war in memory of this chapter in

share pin 0 shares like like love haha wow sad angry 1 thyblackman com while democrats have pursued a policy largely of obstruction and impeachment several pollsters like gallup have found president donald trump s approval rating to be on an upswing repulsion among swing voters at democrats undying refusal to accept the results of the 2016 election likely plays a role in this uptick this rallying behind trump can be seen in massive impeachment related fundraising numbers for his re election campaign however the unrelenting strength of the us economy is also playing a critical role in trump s recent rise and will be a cornerstone in his pitch to voters for another term indeed a cnn poll found 76 of americans view the economy as good the highest rating in two decades remarkably democrats during last week s debate refused to accept this reality with joe biden trying to argue that americans don t really like the economy and that the middle class is getting killed biden must have been confusing trump s economy with the one americans endured during the obama biden years by now you likely know some of the key top line statistics unemployment is at a 50 year low for african americans an all time low the stock market sits at a record high thanks to higher asset prices income and savings americans household net worth has increased by about 18 trillion since trump took office apple s ceo called our economy the strongest in the world while trump s job numbers have been called the best of our lives nonetheless democrats will try to downplay this era of economic prosperity and talk down our economy primarily by pushing two economic narratives that are myths if not outright lies democrat myth 1 trump is just riding obama s coattails reality trump s economy these three years have been far stronger than most apolitical economists expected in december 2016 the federal reserve predicted the unemployment rate would be 4 5 at the end of 2019 instead it is 3 5 which translates to 1 8 2 million additional jobs due to trump s economy exceeding expectations lower unemployment also came with a 0 5 rise in the labor force participation rate to 63 2 it had fallen by 1 9 under obama the trump labor market has been so strong that it has brought americans who had given up on ever working again back into the labor market and into jobs giving hope where hope was lost similarly real gdp today is 1 4 larger than expected by the fed and independent economists when trump took office which is an additional 280 billion in annual output that s an additional 3 200 for an average family of four this stronger growth has come thanks to better productivity as trump s tax cuts incentivized greater business investment annual productivity growth has averaged 1 4 under trump nearly doubling the 0 8 of the obama expansion which translates to greater capacity and potential wage growth in obama s final year in office real disposable personal income rose a paltry 1 6 barely half of the 3 1 growth seen over the past twelve months similarly the manufacturing sector was stagnating during the latter obama years actually shedding 7 000 jobs in 2016 obama even bemoaned it would take a magic wand to bring manufacturing jobs back well manufacturing employment has grown by 530 000 under president trump turns out lower taxes deregulation and smarter trades work as well as a magic wand this economic strength has come even amid in a 1 6 rise in the personal savings rate which translates to another 400 billion in annual savings vs the late 2016 pace these increased savings will help more americans attain retirement handle unexpected bills or make large purchases like a house or car in the future laying the groundwork for future economic growth and safeguarding us from negative shocks the trump economy is consistently exceeding obama era benchmarks democrat myth 2 trump s economy isn t working for the middle class reality the strength of the trump economy and the tightness of our labor market are disproportionately helping working and middle class americans non supervisors are consistently receiving faster wage growth than their bosses most recently at 3 7 vs 3 0 indeed nonsupervisory pay is running at its fastest pace in over a decade similarly per the atlanta fed those in the bottom quartile of pay have seen faster wage than those at the top during every month of trump s presidency most recently at 4 5 v 3 5 data from indeed also shows low wage industries sporting the fastest wage growth since trump took office disposable personal income has risen by 16 0 while corporate profits after tax have risen by 13 8 every group has done well in trump s economy but workers particularly those in the middle and working classes have done the best trump has run a tight labor where there are more job openings than unemployed people which forces companies to compete for workers a paradigm shift from the obama and bush economies when workers fought for jobs giving them little bargaining power with workers harder to find companies now have to pay up for talent boosting wages and transferring income from capital to labor which will also help reduce inequality add to this tight labor market more restrictive immigration and trade policy that encourages domestic production and the need for american workers has never been greater the trump economy is working for working people ultimately democrats and the media can try to spin and mischaracterize the trump economy all they want but paychecks don t lie and american paychecks are delivering better news to more people than at any time in a generation this is a tremendous period of american prosperity and if we stay the course there s no reason it can t continue back in 1980 ronald reagan asked america are you better off than you were four years ago in november 2020 america will be asked the same question and based on the economic data in hand the answer will be a resounding yes written by scott ruesterholz official website
where was this product made is this brand sustainable those are common conscientious consumer queries these days for a growing number of americans though another question is taking precedence is this a black owned business what used to be considered a statement of radical afrocentricism is now little different from buy green buy woman owned or even buy american said maggie anderson the author of our black year one family s quest to buy black in america s racially divided economy via email like those movements buying black broadcasts one s politics but it is also a hit them where it hurts response to big brands that make racist gaffe see blackface balaclavas after racist gaffe see little black sambo charms by buying black consumers are consciously disengaging from the viral cycle of corporate ignorance public outrage and corporate apology and in the face of today s fraught politics and overt racism it marks a return to a form of economic protest from another time in america s not so distant history
with the 2020 presidential campaign in full swing it is clear that the defining issue of the election will be economic inequality and that puts america s billionaires in the dock proposals for a tax on extreme wealth have been put on the table by democratic candidates elizabeth warren and bernie sanders eliciting responses of varying vehemence from the billionaires lobby these responses as we ve reported have been mostly negative although here and there a few billionaires have allowed that yes they may have too much money and it might be good public policy to redistribute some of it through taxation advertisement if the rich have to pay a percentage of their wealth in taxes each year it makes it harder for them to maintain or grow their wealth saez and zucman uc berkeley the wealth tax proposals are part of a general attack on economic inequality that all the democratic candidates share to some extent the middle class is getting killed former vice president joe biden said during the dec 19 democratic debate the middle class is getting crushed and the working class has no way up as a consequence of that the idea that we re growing we re not growing the wealthy very wealthy are growing ordinary people are not growing they are not happy with where they are even the two certified billionaires in the democratic race have expressed support for raising taxes on the ultra wealthy i ve been for a wealth tax for over a year tom steyer said during the debate michael r bloomberg who did not appear at the debate said at a campaign event in phoenix three weeks ago that while a wealth tax of the variety proposed by warren or sanders just doesn t work he supports taxing wealthy people like me sanders has proposed a graduated tax on net worth starting at 1 on wealth above 32 million for a married couple rising in steps to 8 on wealth over 10 billion for singles the thresholds would be halved warren s tax would begin at 2 a year on household net worth over 50 million with an additional 4 surcharge on wealth over 1 billion both proposals would raise trillions of dollars over a decade both are also designed explicitly to break up big family hoards sanders says that under his plan the wealth of billionaires would be cut in half over 15 years which would substantially break up the concentration of wealth and power of this small privileged class advertisement and in the words of emmanuel saez and gabriel zucman the uc berkeley economists who are advisors to warren on her wealth tax plan if the rich have to pay a percentage of their wealth in taxes each year it makes it harder for them to maintain or grow their wealth on the other side of the debate are commentators such as erskine bowles a white house chief of staff under bill clinton and henry paulson a treasury secretary under george w bush who called the wealth tax proposals wishful thinking in a recent op ed and lumped them together with proposals such as universal healthcare medicare for all as policies that are fundamentally misguided and would result in economically harmful outcomes that could put our economy on an unstable and precarious path billionaires have been speaking for themselves too in october money manager leon cooperman erupted to politico about warren s plan this is the american dream she s on he said using slightly more descriptive language a couple of weeks later jamie dimon the chairman and ceo of jpmorgan chase groused on cnbc that warren uses some pretty harsh words some would say vilifies successful people for all their dudgeon cooperman and dimon were rather more measured than the late billionaire silicon valley venture investor thomas perkins who in 2014 sought in a letter to the wall street journal to call attention to the parallels of fascist nazi germany to its war on its one percent namely its jews to the progressive war on the american one percent namely the rich it s proper to note that more than 200 of the world s wealthiest individuals and families have signed on to the giving pledge created by bill gates and warren buffett a commitment to donate a majority of their wealth to philanthropic causes the signers include michele b chan and patrick soon shiong the owner of the times advertisement whether such charity solves the social and economic problems of extreme wealth concentration is debatable however since the choice of how to distribute their wealth would remain in the hands of a small number of wealthy persons and underscores the issues raised by how their wealth became so concentrated in the first place even a signer of the pledge has questioned whether it is accomplishing its goals the pledge is growing perhaps not as rapidly as we hoped stated telecommunications billionaire leonard tow in october skepticism about the extreme wealth disparity isn t a new phenomenon given the passage of time and social and economic evolution it s difficult to pin down how the wealth inequality that has developed in this country compares to that of bygone eras and distant climes but in 1929 according to historian william e leuchtenburg 36 000 families the top 0 1 of that era received as much income as the bottom 12 million households or 42 the extreme concentration of wealth in the united states in the late 1800s and again in the 1920s were major contributors to recurrent economic slumps and market crashes once known as panics climaxing with the crash of 1929 and the great depression those crises led to two congressional investigations early in the last century in which lawmakers tried to hold the millionaire nabobs of those eras responsible in the first democratic rep arsène pujo of louisiana put the wall street money trust on trial in 1912 1913 when the market crash of 1907 was still fresh in americans memories pujo s chief quarry was j pierpont morgan whose death in 1913 may have been hastened his doctor reported by the pitiless interrogation he was subjected to from committee counsel samuel untermyer advertisement with the great depression casting its pall over the country in 1933 the senate banking committee again put wall street in the dock this time the star witness grilled by committee counsel ferdinand pecora was j p morgan jr the hearing s enduring image is that of jack morgan at the witness table with lya graf a diminutive performer from the ringling bros circus cradled on his lap where she had been perched by a circus publicity agent graf was mortified by the scene but morgan used it fortuitously to soften his image no longer a grasping devil whose greed and ruthlessness had helped bring the nation to near ruin as the financial journalist john brooks would report but rather a benign old dodderer j p jack morgan jr holds performer lya graf on his knee during the pecora hearings in 1933 associated press the morgan enterprise survived it s the banking giant now headed by dimon though the family s name remains a potent symbol of plutocracy can anyone really dispute that the level of wealth held by the richest americans today has reached absurd levels the wealthiest individual in america amazon founder jeff bezos is worth 114 billion according to the 2019 forbes ranking of the 400 richest americans this is a sum that defeats efforts at human comprehension but let s try if bezos spent 100 million a year on himself it would take him 1 140 years to spend it all saez and zucman calculated what would happen to the bezos fortune if it had been subject to a 3 annual wealth tax applied to the excess over 1 billion since 1982 it would now be worth 86 8 billion meaning that his 100 million annual spending would exhaust his nest egg in a mere 868 years saez and zucman used as their starting point bezos 160 billion fortune in 2018 but he gave his ex wife mackenzie a settlement of about 36 billion in their divorce this year one common defense of billionaires is that they ve earned their wealth through hard work and the discovery of a product or service that brought the world beating a path to their door and therefore a wealth tax is unjust advertisement but that s a simplistic view of the billionaire economy for one thing it overlooks that virtually no one on the forbes list got there without the assistance of armies of employees or that judging from the extreme concentration of the gains from the product or service many of those employees were not paid the full economic value of their contribution if these multi billionaires listed as members of the forbes 400 in 2018 had been subject since 1982 to the 3 wealth tax or an even higher tax of 10 what would be the result answer they d still be fabulously wealthy saez zucman nor does the argument acknowledge that some billionaires reached the list not due to their own hard work and intellect but that of their forebears or late spouses the widow of david koch who died this year is in at no 13 by virtue of her inheritance of a 42 stake in koch industries descendants of walmart founder sam walton occupy three of the top 15 slots two surviving grandchildren of candy maker frank mars and children of his son forrest mars sr who made the family company a global force share no 19 mackenzie bezos is at no 15 some of these heirs may have worked in or even presided over the family enterprise but in many cases the hard work of building a family fortune was done before their arrival on the scene politics column america is falling out of love with billionaires and it s about time our emerging political debate over taxing the rich seems to be getting bogged down in details how high a tax rate should we tax income or wealth etc etc the defense of huge fortunes as just deserts evades the question of how much even a successful entrepreneur should retain from his or her effort or how to measure it against the social utility of the fortune s source how should we evaluate facebook co founder mark zuckerberg s roughly 69 billion fortune against damage his company is alleged to have done to the democratic process or its merciless exploitation of personal data for its own profit advertisement in more general terms wealth inequality places immense resources in the hands of people unable to spend it productively and keeps it out of the hands of those who would put it to use instantly whether on staples or creature comforts that should be within the reach of everyone living in the richest country on earth as warren stated in defense of her wealth tax during the dec 19 debate you leave two cents with the billionaires they re not eating more pizzas they re not buying more cars we invest that 2 in early childhood education and childcare that means those babies get top notch care it means their mamas can finish their education it means their mamas and their daddies can take on real jobs harder jobs longer hours that brings us to the putative drawbacks of a wealth tax some contend that heavy taxation on the income or assets of the affluent will sap them of a willingness to work depriving the economy of their energy and intellect even if that were plausible it suggests that millionaires and billionaires should be subject to a work requirement before receiving a tax cut much as conservatives advocate work requirements on low income americans seeking coverage from medicaid critics of the wealth tax proposals argue it would be difficult even impossible to fairly value private assets outside established markets such as fine art and private companies and that it would prompt widespread asset concealment by billionaires intent on evasion saez and zucman counter that most nonliquid assets can be valued based on known metrics reported sales and profits for nonpublic businesses comparable property appraisals for real estate artworks can be evaluated based on their insurance coverage and in any case account for a relatively small share of billionaires wealth as for evasion tolerating tax evasion is a policy choice they observe both warren and sanders advocate increased funding for the internal revenue service and more stringent standards for auditing big taxpayers advertisement it may be hard to divine today what form a wealth tax may take but pressure to bring extremely large fortunes under control is unlikely to ebb among the democratic candidates the only real disagreement on economic policy appears to be over how aggressively to go after concentrated and inherited wealth not whether it s worth reining in at all come the general election the democratic candidate will draw a distinction between that viewpoint and the republican mantra which is that the economy has been growing overall so why should anyone rich poor or middle class complain some billionaires evidently perceive that there s danger for their own wealth and the economy at large in today s level of inequality america has a moral ethical and economic responsibility to tax our wealth more wrote 20 millionaires and billionaires including george soros heiress abigail disney and venture investor and entrepreneur nick hanauer in an open letter in june a wealth tax could help address the climate crisis improve the economy improve health outcomes fairly create opportunity and strengthen our democratic freedoms instituting a wealth tax they concluded is in the interest of our republic
with the stroke of a pen united states president donald trump shut down the most significant energy project in the world on friday mr trump signed into law the 2020 national defense authorization act as soon as he did so allseas the swiss dutch engineering company laying pipe for the russian german nord stream 2 gas line project stopped work it s an impressive demonstration of the massive economic power america only rarely uses the law placed sanctions on any company involved in laying the pipes under the baltic sea between germany and russia had allseas continued work its office in texas would have been seized as would all of its specialized ships if they entered u s waters these sanctions have wide ranging implications the eu observer wrote on saturday emphasis added throughout nord stream 2 has long divided the eu as well as the west more broadly on strategic grounds it would enable russia to pump almost all of its eu gas exports via germany allowing the kremlin to cut off poland the baltic states or ukraine for political reasons it was seen as a betrayal in eastern europe where it has been compared to the molotov ribbentrop pact a nazi soviet era deal to carve up the region and it was mistrusted by nordic countries whether mr trump has shut down the deal for good remains to be seen only around 100 miles of the 750 mile pipeline remains to be laid the deeper harder portions are already completed but specialist pipeline ships are still rare russia has one that it says could do the job but it could not make it to the baltic for another couple of months even if the project is only delayed it still is a big boost for poland poland is working on a new pipeline of its own connecting it to norway and its north sea oil poland is also expanding its ability to import liquified natural gas which is carried via tanker not pipeline once these projects are complete by the end of 2022 poland will no longer need russia s gas there is now an expiration date on russia s ability to blackmail poland with energy it will be touch and go whether russia can get nord stream 2 operational before that expiration date passes but president trump has given poland a fighting chance this is just the latest example of america s ability to change the world with the stroke of a pen shortly after coming into office mr trump put sanctions not only on iran but also on any company based anywhere in the world doing business with iran with some exceptions america s economy has such clout that even firms with nothing to do with the u s stopped trading with iran even some chinese state owned oil companies have shied away from doing business with iran out of fear of economic retribution from the u s europe has tried to get around these sanctions setting up new systems to bypass the dollar or the u s financial system it has failed no major company is willing to risk getting shut out of the u s for the sake of iran at the same time these aggressive sanctions have exposed a new world order during the cold war america britain and western europe were against russia but now when it comes to nord stream iran or trade policy in general it is america and britain on one side and western europe and russia on the other at the heart of this switch is germany it now leads europe and it led europe into this relationship with russian president vladimir putin much of europe including france was at one point against nord stream 2 but germany got its way we ve now reached the situation where one half of nato is threatening sanctions on the other and germany is helping russia expand its power in central and eastern europe rather than trying to keep russia out trumpet editor in chief gerald flurry described this split and the pipeline s role in it in his article germany and russia s secret war against america in that article he showed how the bible describes the growing anger toward america that is building in germany jeremiah 1 13 describes a seething pot and the face thereof is toward the north this symbolic language is describing modern germany wrote mr flurry beneath the surface that nation is full of simmering dissatisfaction with the current world order germans are angry at the u s and especially furious with president trump the imperialistic ambition that prompted germany to start both world wars is alive and well it is seething it is becoming increasingly clear that the u s and germany are no longer on the same side they are allies on paper only and this trade war also points germany to a powerful way to get back at the u s the dollar america s banks and the other parts of the american financial system sit at the foundation of global trade this gives the u s huge power power that no other previous president has wielded in quite the way mr trump is at the same time america s financial system is fragile the nation is borrowing over 1 trillion a year it has debt it can never realistically expect to pay back the world s economy rests on this flawed foundation sooner or later it will collapse once that happens the global economy will need a new foundation whomever supplies that foundation will have enormous power in revelation 17 the bible describes a beast or empire that was and is not verse 8 periodically in history this beast rises on the world scene and then disappears only to rise up again and surprise the world this empire is led by a women verse 1 prophetic symbolism for a church the description it gives matches the european powers led by the catholic church that have continually risen and fallen and it tells us that it will rise one more time revelation 18 tells us this power will have massive economic power the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through her verse 3 these merchants were the great men of the earth verse 23 the empire is filled with great riches this german led european power will become the new center of the global economy the bible says it will wield this economic power far more ruthlessly than america has ever done america britain and the jewish state in the middle east are the descendants of ancient israel for proof read our free book the united states and britain in prophecy by herbert w armstrong the bible says these nations will be the target of this new economic and military power in deuteronomy 28 52 god tells israel that its enemies will besiege thee in all thy gates cut its economy off from the outside world the most extreme form of a trade war ezekiel 4 5 describe a siege of jerusalem along with the other tribes of israel this siege as outlined in ezekiel 4 did not happen during ezekiel s time in fact most of ancient israel had already been conquered deported and enslaved by the time the prophet wrote this it is prophecy not history germany will use its control of the global economy not just to target one or two companies but to cut off food oil energy all trade from the nations of israel when it comes to the nord stream 2 pipeline germany and america are already on opposites sides they are already in a trade war germany is laying the groundwork for a future clash europe has signed landmark trade deals with canada and japan it is working on another with latin america these deals have all taken place in the last few years germany is creating the world s largest free trade zone centered on the european union the consequences of this trade war are terrible at the same time there is great hope in this inevitable future this coming war is referred to time and again in the bible it is a key part of god s plan and part of his great purpose to learn more about this coming clash and the great hope behind it read mr flurry s article germany and russia s secret war against america

the final call world news african continental free trade area biggest 2019 win for the motherland by jehron muhammad last updated dec 25 2019 1 25 37 pm what s your opinion on this article historic photo of representatives from participating countries at the african continental free trade area summit held march 17 21 2018 in kigali rwanda the 2019 implementation of the african continental free trade area afcfta has to be the yearâ s most significant accomplishment for africa after the continentâ s exploitation through the berlin conference and its devastating consequences african heads of states finally came together and reached a consensus observed dr arikana chihombori quao former african union permanent ambassador to the united states with her dismissal from her au post the zimbabwe born hbcu trained medical doctor turned diplomat has become a spokesperson for pan african unity and the african diaspora â they african leaders signed what was called the african continental free trade area this is an agreement that will bring together a combined gdp of 3 trillion a workforce of 1 2 billion people and a marketplace you can establish yourself in one part of africa that can expand like wild fire throughout the continent â she said when the former ambassador made the declaration during a recent two day visit to philly a standing room only audience at community college of philadelphia shouted â hallelujah â she likened the beginning of the african free trade area to the â birth of a babyâ and described the trials and tribulations of the african union as necessary discomfort or difficulty experienced during pregnancy the african free trade area will be the worldâ s largest free trade area since the establishment of the world trade organization wto in 1994 professor landry signe a rubinstein fellow at the global economy and development program and africa growth initiative at the brookings institute estimates that under a successfully implemented agreement combined consumer and business spending in africa will reach 6 7 trillion by 2030 he also says afcfta will impact manufacturing and industrial development tourism intra african cooperation and economic transformation the united nations economic commission for africa predicts the agreement will raise intra african trade by 15 percent to 25 percent or 50 billion to 70 billion by 2040 compared to trade without the agreement the international monetary fund projects that under af cfta africaâ s expanded and more efficient goods and labor markets will increase her overall ranking on the global competitiveness index increased market access in turn is expected to enhance the competitiveness of industries and enterprises and bring other benefits reported brookings edu at a time when the united states great britain and france appear â under siege â africa building continent wide sustainable economic infrastructure is a necessity president trumpâ s nationalism and impeachment is hurting u s global influence defining brexit and its ramifications appear to be the only agenda item for uk prime minister boris johnsonâ s foreseeable future and france is facing crippling transportation and union strikes and protests with no end in sight the france backed and printed cfa franc used by west and central african states to undergird their currency is egregious that the influential uk based financial times repeated a warning given to french president emmanuel macron that the cfa franc didnâ t look â sustainable for france to continue this arrangement â â the political costs may be outweighing the economic gains â said carlos lopes high representative of the commission of the african union who noted cfa franc stability had benefited french exporters and investors dr chihombori quao speaking in philadelphia to a group of black journalists said â they western powers donâ t do coups anymore they simply create instability in an african country so when you hear of instability in an african country ask yourself what is really going on â france and other western nations who depend on the instability of africa as the former ambassador has repeatedly said know the uk is fading out of the european union picture and face other problems france is pushing eu member states to contribute financial and military support for the g5 sahel counter terrorism mission launched in 2017 as a joint military force commanded by burkina faso chad mali mauritania and niger and other security operations reportedâ theafricareport com the entry of afcfta in may 2019 offered a unique opportunity to build world class infrastructure accelerate industrial development and boost intra african and global trade â africa â according to dr mukhisa kituyi secretary general of unctad â has embarked on a journey of transformational change while the international media may be portraying a dismal picture of africans as refugees fleeing the continent on boats the reality on the continent is much different â economic integration is progressing on the continent and afcfta is an important development milestone â while the rest of the world has often felt captive to trade tensions between the worldâ s two largest economies since july 2019 the 55 members of the african union have entered the operational phase of the afcfta putting into action far reaching plans to tear down barriers to trade and mobility on the continent â said dr kituyi â as africaâ s manufacturing sector develops and industrialization increases the continent has the potential to become a strategic link for trade african countries with geographic advantages such as south africa or nigeria should look to develop free trade zones similar to jafza jafza is the jebel ali free zone authority an economic colossus that accounts for 93 billion in annual trade and nearly one quarter of dubaiâ s gdp numerous ports in africa have potential given their geographic positions and strategic importance the port of durban in south africa of djibouti in djibouti of lagos in nigeria of mombasa in kenya of tema in ghana of abidjan in cote dâ ivoire of douala in cameroon and of tangier in morocco for example â observed professor landry signe dr chihombori quao says her mandate is not only to promote africa but to mobilize the african diaspora those africans that migrated to the west and their descendants and those whose ancestors who originally came on slave ships these diaspora africans are a principle ingredient needed for africaâ s development and they are not under the control of european powers she says but she adds first they need to be informed organized and unified

mexico city low inflation tight public spending and a reduction in the vast debts of loss making state oil giant petroleos mexicanos pemex have helped spruce up mexico s so called risk profile which reached its safest level in five years this month risk premiums of investing in mexico as measured by traders in credit default swaps cds hit their lowest level since november 2014 despite business and investor concerns about the economic management of the leftist government economic growth has ground to a halt during the first year in office of president andres manuel lopez obrador who has repeatedly castigated excessive free market liberalism for ruining mexico analysts expect growth to be weak next year too but inflation is below the central bank s 3 per cent target and mr lopez obrador has lowered trade tensions with the united states mexico has also avoided the social unrest that has racked many emerging markets in 2019 especially in latin america against this backdrop mexico s five year cds a barometer of a country s default risk was quoted at 75 basis points earlier this month on monday it stood at 81 basis points the stable debt to gdp ratio contained inflation a central bank with a good reputation and the government s fiscal discipline have made mexican debt very attractive and low risk said jose luis ortega director of debt investments at asset management firm blackrock mr lopez obrador s government has promised to lower to 45 per cent the debt to gdp ratio which touched 50 per cent in 2016 the president has vowed to revive pemex the world s most indebted oil company cutting its financial debt by around us 7 billion this year via refinancing operations however pemex s debt still stands close to us 100 billion and is viewed as a major risk to the financial stability and creditworthiness of latin america s second largest economy the cds risk rating has not always reflected favourably on the administration of mr lopez obrador who spooked investors by cancelling a part built us 13 billion mexico city airport five weeks before taking office in december 2018 at their worst cds spreads on mexico shot to 147 basis points shortly after he assumed power during the six year term of his predecessor enrique pena nieto cds spreads fluctuated between 64 and 230 points mexico s 5 year cds spread level was last week 20 basis points lower than the benchmark cds emerging markets index made up of 15 developing economies and compiled by data firm markit it was mexico s lowest risk level since october 2014 rating agency standard poor s last week reaffirmed mexico s credit rating at bbb a 2 but kept the outlook negative implying a one in three risk of a downgrade in the coming year reuters
lendingclub executives cheer at the new york stock exchange in june lendingclub is among the lenders being increasingly picky about the loans that we are booking chief executive scott sanborn told investors recently lara briehl had a desperate client who was itching to accept an offer the man was struggling to pay his bills and an online lender had offered him a personal loan to pay off some 10 credit cards accepting he thought would help him escape crushing debt the interest rate offered however was about 10 percentage points higher than on his plastic i told him i would not take that deal in a million years said briehl a bremerton wash based credit counselor at american financial solutions a nonprofit that helps distressed borrowers repair their finances online personal loans were easy to come by for years enabling millions of americans to borrow cheaply to pay down costly credit card debt in the last year though companies including lendingclub corp have been tightening the spigot following a revolt by investors upset over years of unexpected losses easy credit has given way to cautiousness with financial technology upstarts now seeking households with higher incomes above average credit scores and less debt relative to their wages advertisement we together with others are being increasingly picky about the loans that we are booking lendingclub chief executive scott sanborn told investors last month on the san francisco company s earnings call across the board you re seeing a number of people lendingclub included kind of prudently pulling in and tightening a little bit on the credit they re offering last quarter the average personal loan in the united states went to a borrower with a 717 credit score the highest average ever recorded according to preliminary figures from credit data provider peeriq the typical borrower reported 100 000 plus in annual income also a record fintechs are now so focused on borrowers with pristine credit only about a quarter of their new unsecured loans this year have gone to households with below prime credit scores making the companies more conservative than credit unions according to transunion the internet first financial companies that emerged in the aftermath of last decade s credit crisis promised to upend the industry by lending to risky borrowers shunned by banks instead online lenders are looking more and more like their old line rivals analysts who follow the companies are split on whether that newfound prudence reflects concerns about where the economy is headed or an evolution of the lenders business models open field no company better exemplifies the trend than lendingclub the biggest online lender founded in 2006 it started as a platform for matching borrowers needing credit with individual retail investors willing to provide it without branches to operate or thousands of loan officers to pay marketplace lenders offered the promise of cheaper loans at a time when the biggest u s banks were reeling from the financial crisis loan growth took off in the wake of the great recession when interest rates hovered near record lows and banks were choosing their borrowers carefully banks left the playing field open said nat hoopes executive director of the marketplace lending assn companies such as lendingclub marketed themselves as better than banks at judging risk claiming to use all sorts of data that enabled them to give borrowers the lowest rates possible one investor in marketplace loans theorem partners claims that bus drivers are 25 less likely to default than administrative assistants greater job security while wedding loans are 10 more likely to be repaid than business loans marriage means financial stability advertisement banks generally lend to borrowers with super prime and prime plus credit scores that created an opportunity for new entrants to make money lending to households with prime and near prime credit scores said john wirth vice president of fintech strategy at transunion these borrowers were the sweet spot of the market he said lendingclub s borrowers were often in areas underserved by traditional banks according to research by the federal reserve bank of philadelphia until 2018 more than 60 of fintech personal loans went to borrowers whose credit scores were prime and below transunion data show some 53 of lendingclub s borrowers between 2008 and 2015 were rated internally as c d and e on an a through g scale according to the treasury department a rated borrowers enjoyed interest rates as low as 5 99 while e rated borrowers paid as much as 28 26 disappointment loss rates on loans fintechs sold to investors ended up much higher than forecast almost across the board said john bella who oversees coverage of u s asset backed securities at fitch ratings even in a relatively benign economic environment these issuers are underperforming their own models and expectations jackson walker a 32 year old san francisco tech worker said he started funding lendingclub loans in 2014 drawn in by promises of annual returns as high as 20 walker concentrated on funding lower rated loans thinking they d generate the highest profit he ended up with 4 annual returns before yanking his money and vowing to never again do business with lendingclub it turns out banks are pretty good at lending walker said it s not just investors in loans who are hurting lendingclub which went public in 2014 at a market valuation higher than all but 13 u s banks 8 46 billion has since lost almost 90 of its value i ve been in hundreds and hundreds of meetings and equity investors are screaming at businesses to take risk off the table said john hecht a jefferies analyst who follows consumer lenders for the publicly traded fintechs such as lendingclub if you look at their stock price they had no choice but to tighten advertisement fintechs have raised prices on loans to customers with less than stellar credit and shut some out completely on an earnings call in february chief executive sanborn said lendingclub has cut loan approvals by 17 and raised borrowing costs by almost 1 percentage point we re being selective about who we re bringing in he told investors a few months earlier at an industry conference the company has since become even more restrictive it s stopped lending to borrowers who would ve received its three lowest internal grades and more loans are going to top rated borrowers company data show anuj nayar a lendingclub spokesman said the company s shift toward less risky borrowers reflects investor demand lendingclub isn t alone competitor prosper marketplace inc told investors this month that its borrowers in 2019 have the highest credit scores and income and lowest debt to income ratios in at least six years we have tightened massively said ashish gupta prosper s chief credit officer climbing delinquency rates on americans credit cards the lender uses the metric to assess whether households are able to pay their bills are part of why prosper s loan approval rate has fallen dramatically he said for subprime customers fintechs pullback mirrors what they ve experienced generally when borrowing money in the last several years according to the financial stability oversight council made up of u s banking and market regulators the group said in a report this month that total loan balances for borrowers with subprime scores remain well below pre crisis levels which it attributed partly to somewhat tight credit availability for higher risk borrowers advertisement briehl said she s seen this play out in her neighborhood in the seattle suburbs until recently subprime borrowers could get loans with favorable terms now she said it s rare for them to get better rates than they re already paying on their credit cards nasiripour writes for bloomberg

tesla s industrial batteries would be installed at the homer electric power station in soldotna photo provided by homer electric association a southcentral alaska utility is working with electric car maker tesla to install a large battery system aimed at replacing natural gas fired power for short periods and cutting greenhouse gas emissions homer electric association announced the contract with california based tesla this month the kenai peninsula cooperative said it will use the company s industrial batteries which can quickly release stored power into grids the batteries will be installed at the utility s power plant in soldotna in what s known as a battery energy storage system or bess they should begin operating in fall 2021 the battery system s power can be delivered to the grid at a rate of 46 5 megawatts an hour the system can operate at that rate for two hours before it must be recharged said brad janorschke the utility s general manager at night there are times when that battery could serve all our members for up to two hours janorschke said homer electric s service area covers the western kenai peninsula and includes 34 000 electric meters and 24 000 member owners the battery system will increase the utility s ability to provide power without disruptions said janorschke advertisement the utility gets most of its power from plants on the kenai peninsula including renewable energy from the bradley lake hydroelectric project but power from anchorage provides a critical backup to prevent blackouts if a local power plant temporarily goes down he said that link is broken for a total of about one month per year on average usually for maintenance of power lines sometimes the disconnect lasts longer this year the swan lake fire that damaged power lines contributed to several additional months of disruption to backup power the battery system will be another backup source of energy but it will be available year round he said its power can be put into the grid more quickly and efficiently than power from a gas fired turbine it s almost instantaneous janorschke said it can be recharged when the utility is producing power at its most efficient levels it will save significant dollars in fuel every year he said as gas prices escalate those savings will keep going up janorschke said the utility is not yet disclosing the cost of the battery system the utility plans to pay for the system using debt financing and financial reserves debt financing often involves entities issuing bonds to raise money from investors homer electric association isn t the first alaska utility to implement this idea golden valley electric association in fairbanks installed a large battery storage system in 2003 it helped reduce power outages and has provided some significant economic benefits as well said dan bishop the engineering manager for that utility homer electric s batteries will employ new technology that will allow the utility to more effectively incorporate renewable power such as from wind or solar he said the new technology also allows for more frequent use of the batteries ours operates 50 to 80 times a year typically bishop said of the fairbanks system theirs will be able to operate perhaps daily tesla s media department did not return an email seeking comment janorschke said idaho based power engineers will handle site design tesla is also providing technicians to support the installation
it s rare that i read something on the washington post that i don t find highly biased even repugnant but with their recent article on the afghanistan papers they truly knocked the ball out of the park the facts they shared should have every american protesting in the streets trillions of dollars have been spent on a war that the pentagon knew was unwinnable all along more than 2300 american soldiers died there and more than 20 000 have been injured more than 150 000 afghanis were killed many of them civilians including women and children and they lied to us constantly congress just proved that the truth doesn t matter though a mere 22 hours after the release of this document the new national defense authorization act that breezed through the house and senate was signed by the president that bill authorized 738 billion in military spending for 2020 actually increasing the budget by 22 billion over previous years so how is your representation in washington dc working out for you the dark secrets of sh selco begovic best price 17 24 buy new 17 75 as of 08 50 utc details what are the afghanistan papers the afghanistan papers are a brilliant piece of investigative journalism published by the washington post and the article is very much worth your time to read i know i know wapo but believe me when i tell you this is something all americans need to see this was an article that took three years of legal battles to bring to light wapo acquired the documents using the freedom of information act and got more than 2000 pages of insider interviews with people who played a direct role in the war from generals and diplomats to aid workers and afghan officials these documents were originally part of a federal investigation into the root failures of the longest conflict in us history more than 18 years now three presidents george w bush barack obama and donald trump have been involved in this ongoing war it turns out that officials knew the entire time this war was unwinnable yet they kept throwing american lives and american money at it here s an excerpt from wapo s report anything that is italicized is taken verbatim from the papers themselves you can click on them to read the documents the important thing to note about these interviews is that the interviewees never expected their words to become public they weren t blowing the whistle they were answering questions for a federal investigation so they didn t hold back these aren t soundbites it s what the real witnesses are saying the u s government has not carried out a comprehensive accounting of how much it has spent on the war in afghanistan but the costs are staggering since 2001 the defense department state department and u s agency for international development have spent or appropriated between 934 billion and 978 billion according to an inflation adjusted estimate calculated by neta crawford a political science professor and co director of the costs of war project at brown university those figures do not include money spent by other agencies such as the cia and the department of veterans affairs which is responsible for medical care for wounded veterans what did we get for this 1 trillion effort was it worth 1 trillion jeffrey eggers a retired navy seal and white house staffer for bush and obama told government interviewers he added after the killing of osama bin laden i said that osama was probably laughing in his watery grave considering how much we have spent on afghanistan source the us government deliberately misled the american people the prepperu2019s wate daisy luther best price 7 49 buy new 9 94 as of 06 00 utc details what s more if you officials up to and including three presidents knew they were throwing money at something that could never be achieved they did it anyway and they lied to our faces about it the documents also contradict a long chorus of public statements from u s presidents military commanders and diplomats who assured americans year after year that they were making progress in afghanistan and the war was worth fighting several of those interviewed described explicit and sustained efforts by the u s government to deliberately mislead the public they said it was common at military headquarters in kabul and at the white house to distort statistics to make it appear the united states was winning the war when that was not the case every data point was altered to present the best picture possible bob crowley an army colonel who served as a senior counterinsurgency adviser to u s military commanders in 2013 and 2014 told government interviewers surveys for instance were totally unreliable but reinforced that everything we were doing was right and we became a self licking ice cream cone source it s been an epic 18 year long exercise in cya cover your a i don t see how anyone could fail to be outraged by this and what i ve cited here is just the crap icing on the maggot cupcake it s a festering mess and i urge you if you really want to know the truth to read this article on wapo and click on these links how was all this money spent a lot of it went to building infrastructure in afghanistan it was flagrantly and frivolously used there while we live in a place where people are going bankrupt at best and dying at worst because they can t afford medical care and there are places in our country without clean running water or toilets aren t you angry about this don t you feel betrayed as more americans struggle to pay their bills and eat food and keep a roof over their heads each month who benefits from this as usual follow the money the defense industry certainly reaped rewards and it s highly likely a lot of people who had the power to allow it to go on made some wise investments that have paid off for them but for the rest of us this conflict has done nothing except ensure that our tax dollars are not here improving our infrastructure or helping americans lead better and more productive lives dr ron paul refers to this as the crime of the century it is not only members of the bush obama and trump administrations who are guilty of this massive fraud falsely selling the afghanistan war as a great success was a bipartisan activity on capitol hill in the dozens of hearings i attended in the house international relations committee i do not recall a single expert witness called who told us the truth instead both republican and democrat controlled congresses called a steady stream of neocon war cheerleaders to lie to us about how wonderfully the war was going victory was just around the corner they all promised just a few more massive appropriations and we d be celebrating the end of the war congress and especially congressional leadership of both parties are all as guilty as the three lying administrations they were part of the big lie falsely presenting to the american people as expert witnesses only those bought and paid for beltway neocon think tankers what is even more shocking than the release of this smoking gun evidence that the us government wasted two trillion dollars and killed more than three thousand americans and more than 150 000 afghans while lying through its teeth about the war is that you could hear a pin drop in the mainstream media about it aside from the initial publication in the washington post which has itself been a major cheerleader for the war in afghanistan the mainstream media has shown literally no interest in what should be the story of the century source and it s most likely that nobody will ever face punishment for this deception if this is not the very definition of the term war crimes i can hardly imagine what is dr paul continues we ve wasted at least half a year on the donald trump impeachment charade a conviction desperately in search of a crime meanwhile one of the greatest crimes in us history will go unpunished not one of the liars in the afghanistan papers will ever be brought to justice for their crimes none of the three presidents involved will be brought to trial for these actual high crimes rumsfeld and lute and the others will never have to fear justice because both parties are in on it there is no justice source the response silence and a budget increase the people in government don t care that we know about all this sure it s mildly inconvenient but whatever how do i know this be ready for anything daisy luther best price 10 45 buy new 9 69 as of 07 15 utc details simple less than a full day after the story broke the new ndaa ended up on president trump s desk and was signed authorizing an additional 22 billion dollars for next year s defense spending and all anyone can talk about is oooohhhh space force government merry christmas we re going to blow through more of your tax money and you won t get a damned thing for it i couldn t make this up if i tried in a notable must read op ed darius shahtahmasebi cited some horrific incidents and concluded we can t let this recent publication obscure itself into nothingness the recent reaction from congress is a giant middle finger designed to tell you that a there will never be anything you can do about it and b they simply don t care how you feel democracy at its finest from the world s leading propagator of democratic values source when is enough going to be enough why are we not enraged en masse why haven t we recalled these treasonous bastards and taken our country and our budget back for a country that is ready to take up arms and waste countless hours impeaching trump over something he said on a phone call it sure says a lot about those same people ignoring 18 years of treasonous behavior by three separate administrations why isn t the media raising hell over this why aren t these lives important why isn t sending trillions of our dollars to be frittered away an outrage people love to say america first and impeach trump for treason and all that jazz they love to call anti war people un american and recommend a quick one way trip to somalia if we don t support our troops however i think is far more evidence of supporting our troops to want out of there not risking their lives based on a castle of lies that further enriches powerful and wealthy people who have nothing to lose most people love to be outraged about frivolous matters but when a report like this and its following insult are met with resounding silence it s pretty obvious that hardly anybody is really paying attention reprinted with permission from the organic prepper the best of daisy luther
kenya launched freight operations on december 17 for a new extension on a multibillion dollar china built railway line which is funded on terms that could end up giving china control over some of kenya s most important assets at the inauguration ceremony kenyan president uhuru kenyatta called the opening a new chapter in kenya s development today is another momentous day a day when we add yet another brick in our quest to build a stronger foundation for our current and future prosperity the new service runs from kenya s capital nairobi to the naivasha inland container depot and is part of the greater standard gauge railway sgr connecting nairobi to mombasa kenya the largest and most valuable port in east africa mombasa is not just the gateway into kenya but also into its landlocked neighboring nations burundi the democratic republic of congo rwanda south sudan and uganda h e president uhuru kenyatta has arrived at the nairobi terminus for the commissioning of the sgr freight operations to naivasha also in attendance is h e wang yong special envoy from the people s republic of china pic twitter com uwcutvbm4o kenya railways kenyarailways_ december 17 2019 since 2013 kenya has accepted more than 5 billion from china for sgr construction making it the largest infrastructure project since the nation s independence but in its first year of operation the project reported losses equivalent to 98 million rendering kenya s servicing of the loans unmanageable critics say that since shipping by truck remains a cheaper option for most freight the sgr is unlikely to begin turning a profit kenyan auditor general edward ouko warned last november that the terms of sgr financing were written cryptically and designed to favor the china exim bank which loaned kenya railways corp funds for the project f kenya railways corporation defaults in its obligations and china exim bank exercises power over the escrow account security ouko s office wrote in a nov 16 2018 audit report he china exim bank would become a principle over some kenyan assets including the mombasa port the kpa assets are exposed since the authority signed the agreement where it has been referred to as a borrower under clause 17 5 and any proceeding against its assets by the lender would not be protected by sovereign immunity since the government waived the immunity on the kenya ports assets by signing the agreement page 3 of auditor general s report kenya s port collateral for china loan pic twitter com ok09shkd3g john githongo johngithongo december 19 2018 bumpy ride kenya gov lowers estimate of 1st year s revenue for new sgr railway by 44 every time a train runs along its mombasa nairobi route it does so at a loss adding to project s debt at a time when loan repayments to china rise 6x pic twitter com mfhvzzgkm0 james hall hallaboutafrica june 1 2019 africa stand noted that in addition to the mombasa port kenya could also be made to give china control of the inland container depot in nairobi it wrote implications of a takeover would be grave including the thousands of port workers who would be forced to work under the chinese lenders authorities in nairobi and beijing deny that a chinese takeover of mombasa port or other kenyan infrastructure is imminent but if china were to take control of assets it funded due to a failure of the receiving nation to repay loans it would not be the first time an alarming precedent in 2013 chinese president xi jinping announced his plans to rebuild the silk road an ancient network of trade routes that facilitated flow of goods ideas and culture across asia the middle east africa and europe the revived version called the belt and road initiative bri aims to connect 60 percent of the global population to china with vast infrastructure projects sri lanka was among the most enthusiastic nations to welcome china s quick cash to build bri related infrastructure it accepted billions of dollars in loans for such projects as the magampura mahinda rajapaksa port in hambantota this port is at a key location for china s maritime road but for the sri lankan economy the port was a massive flop rather than fueling growth the port and other chinese funded infrastructure projects such at the world s emptiest airport in mattala sunk sri lanka into crippling debt by 2016 a third of sri lanka s government revenue went toward servicing chinese loans and the country was forced to accept debt relief from the international monetary fund but the imf provided only short term relief and the sri lankan government soon acknowledged that the only course of action was to hand china a controlling stake in the rajapaksa port for a period of 99 years the handover set off alarms in sri lanka and beyond because it represented a chinese victory with potential military applications foreign policy said the move provided beijing with a deepwater port in the region in which it can dock its navy off the coast of its key regional competitor india how china got sri lanka to hand over a port a times investigation reveals beijing s use of hardball tactics to collect from a weakened ally the new york times nytimes june 26 2018 sri lanka is often cited as the textbook case of china s debt trap diplomacy but djibouti fiji the maldives montenegro pakistan tonga and zambia are all in similarly precarious positions thanks largely to a lack of transparency in china s bri loans experts fear that these nations may be compelled to hand certain assets over to beijing and now kenya may be added to this growing list china wants to avoid the impression that it is sinking its dragon claws into other countries said lu xiankun senior research fellow at the shanghai center for global trade and economic governance during a 2016 imd discovery event but as bri further progresses it is becoming clearer that for some nations that is basically what is happening the times of the gentiles bible prophecy says that in the end time just before the return of jesus christ the world will enter an age called the times of the gentiles jesus christ prophesied about this era in luke 21 24 saying jerusalem shall be trodden down of the gentiles until the times of the gentiles be fulfilled in the july 2014 trumpet issue editor in chief gerald flurry wrote about this approaching epoch these times of the gentiles are yet to be fully realized but we are in the outer edges of this catastrophic storm he wrote in what are the times of the gentiles he explained that the term gentiles refers to non israelite peoples adding that the israelite peoples constitute a lot more than the little nation in the middle east in end time prophecy israel refers mostly to modern day america and britain for a thorough explanation order a copy of our free book the united states and britain in prophecy by herbert w armstrong mr flurry continued once you understand who israel is then you can understand how the gentiles the non israelite peoples have started to take charge of the world right now for decades american and british supremacy has brought stability to much of the world but in the times of the gentiles power is being transferred away from them and toward two non israelite powers primarily while there are many gentile nations around today when this prophecy is completely fulfilled there will be two major powers mr flurry wrote one of these will revolve around germany and the other around russia and china china s bri and related initiatives are shifting global power away from the israelite nations and toward these other nations the project s imbalanced loan terms for nations such as kenya and sri lanka make the perils of the shift more evident mr flurry explained that a primary reason for the global shift in power is america s disappearing will he wrote the big reason these powers are rising today traces back to the power vacuum created by america s weakness and the disappearance of america s will in recent years america has demonstrated its lack of will to use its power in several international arenas recognizing that weakness china is asserting its power china s actions prove that gentiles are rising to power before our eyes and this is just one of many gentile nations growing more aggressive on the world scene the u s is no longer asserting itself as it should which is putting its allies on shaky ground while many will rejoice at the united states demise this trend is building to catastrophe like never before seen mr flurry wrote that though the shift in global power now underway is alarming it is closely tied to good news he continued this is terrifying news luke s record of christ s prophecy says it will be a time of en s hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of heaven shall be shaken luke 21 26 however notice the very next verse and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory verse 27 these times of the gentiles lead directly to the return of jesus christ now that is good news to understand more about china s rise and the good news connected to it read what are the times of the gentiles and brave new world made in china
duluth minn as a new city council member in this small midwestern city last year arik forsman gave himself a mission he was going to solve the region s child care crisis it seemed the perfect project for the 31 year old father of two the local business community was already pushing for more child care slots for its burgeoning workforce giving the matter some momentum the issue was bubbling up nationally even gaining the attention of first daughter ivanka trump it was affecting everyone i know said forsman who had experienced his share of child care drama but a year later the situation has not improved much a local nonprofit group found in october that the area needed 4 505 new child care slots 10 more than it did the year before zoning changes and grant offers that forsman and others began to push were not enough to prevent burnout among existing providers or persuade enough new ones to navigate a system that was highly regulated and hardly profitable forsman s experiences illustrate the uphill battle politicians and others face as they try address the child care deficit in the united states even at a moment of unprecedented political will advertisement studies have shown that more than half of the country lives in a child care desert places where there is a yawning gap between the number of slots needed for children and the number of existing spaces at child care centers the result is years long wait lists for infants and rising costs for parents in at least 28 states parents pay more for child care than they do on their mortgages or for in state college tuition a january report from the nonprofit council for a strong america estimated the country is losing 57 billion in revenue earnings and productivity each year as a result of the child care crisis in northeastern minnesota where the unemployment rate is below the national average the shortage is a byproduct of the prosperous economy employers from the tech hub downtown to the taconite mines up north say qualified workers are turning down jobs because they cannot find affordable child care it s come to the point where it is affecting our growth and our productivity said marty weintraub a founder of a duluth digital marketing agency aimclear that has lost potential employees because of child care woes forsman who works in economic development at a power company was appointed to fill an empty spot on the duluth city council in august 2018 when he was sworn in forsman said he wanted to find a signature issue that could show his pluck he settled on child care i wanted to take on something big forsman said what motivates me is taking on something that s hard and challenging he and his wife jessica had found their own child care solution because there were so few spots in duluth they drove their 4 year old amelia and their 1 year old arlo to a home based day care in another town just as forsman embarked on his political crusade something happened that would upend his own child care plans he got a phone call from his day care provider who said she was retiring forsman was unexpectedly thrust back into navigating the very industry that he was trying to fix advertisement forsman s new child care challenge was happening to parents all over minnesota in the past four years the state had lost 23 of its home based child care centers according to state licensing data in northeast minnesota just in the previous year and a half the region had gained 1 530 new child care slots and lost 1 795 new places were opening but older places were closing it s like we re trying to fill a bucket and there s a hole in the bucket said tony sertich president of the northland foundation a community development nonprofit that issued a report on the region s child care needs in 2018 it s a really tough model child care is so expensive and yet a child care provider makes no money it was also tougher to keep a license at the state level lawmakers were trying to balance the need for more child care providers with the desire to make them as safe as possible a pulitzer prize winning investigation by the star tribune in 2012 revealed that child care facilities in homes and at centers were routinely overcrowded and unsafe with children dying at a rate of one per month in the aftermath the state vowed to have stiffer enforcement but the regulations have had an unintended consequence pushing out longtime providers such as erica hanson hanson 35 opened her in home day care after having children in 2011 and 2012 like many mothers in the area she concluded that staying home with her children was more budget friendly than continuing her job at a call center a friend suggested she could make some extra money watching other children so she paid for training and a license within weeks she was at capacity advertisement she and her husband a 911 dispatcher bought a bigger house with a huge backyard so children could play she stocked their shelves with children s books and filled her closets with princess and superhero costumes her drawers were filled with diapers and topped with baby changing stations hanson knew the state rules were to ensure the enrichment and safety of children but she found the regulations onerous and the penalties unnecessarily harsh hanson understood when she could not hang the ceremonial shotgun her parents brought their first grandson carl on his wall but then came a regulation that she needed to retrofit the windows in her house so that a fire hose could comfortably fit in she grew tired of cleaning bathrooms every night and keeping her hot water set at a child safe 120 degrees then came the final straw her son wanted to get a new pet for his eighth birthday but that too was against regulations the code did not allow for other children to be in the same vicinity as a pet tarantula her annual four figure profit each year just wasn t worth it i stayed in this so long because i love my families and i knew how hard it would be if i stopped said hanson now a mother of three but i got to that point where i was caring more about that those regulations than trying to spend time with my children and i just couldn t anymore advertisement because maintaining an in home operation could be so burdensome forsman tried to get businesses to take advantage of the changes in the zoning law that allowed them to open day care facilities in their offices but interested employers said they were struggling to make the numbers work you almost have to be a philanthropist to do this said laura weintraub who runs aimclear with her husband marty we just aren t sure how we can deal with all the regulations all the staffing and still pay the child care workers a living wage last week the city of duluth opened up a 500 000 fund to help providers start or grow their child care business with a state unemployment rate that was about a half a percentage point below the national average the signs of a strong economy were everywhere in the northern mining area known as the iron range where strip malls and victorian houses give way to parking lots for forklifts and warehouses with welders needed signs local officials kept hearing companies say they would not invest in their community unless they figured out this fundamental piece of the economic puzzle child care workforce and housing they are the three big issues we need to address to make sure we grow said chris ismil an official with a state agency tasked with diversifying the mining communities economy and they are all intertwined and they are all symbiotic for example he said parents worried when a high school science teacher had twins the teacher considered quitting because she did not have child care and stem teachers are hard to replace in rural minnesota no child care meant no teacher ismil cajoled a local center to put her at the top of its wait list advertisement so when child care worker shawntel gruba 36 wanted to open a facility ismil helped her draft a business plan and prepped her to visit banks for loans a mining company sponsored her playground she received more than 1 million in grants and donations in the summer of 2018 gruba making 11 50 an hour became one of the iron range s most talked about business prospects the state flattened a hill to make space for her 8 500 square foot facility with space for 90 children at a time when she receives calls to iron range tykes about spots the inquiries don t come from new parents they are most often from couples who are trying to conceive and they know it is usually fruitless to ask about openings how long is your wait list most ask february 2021 is gruba s unfortunate answer after her first year the state agency let gruba know it would flatten another hill if she wanted to expand but the question made clear another problem in the child care ecosystem the crisis was not prompted simply by a shortage of spots it was deepened by the shortage of adults willing to do the arduous tiring work for such a low wage she noted that a person could make more money at a fast food restaurant or as a teacher s assistant all my girls here including myself we are here because it fulfills our heart gruba said advertisement democrats and republicans at the federal level have acknowledged that the child care system needs to be overhauled but they struggle with the same question politicians and business owners face in duluth how president donald trump s daughter and senior adviser ivanka trump has taken the lead in the administration on parental issues touting the doubling of the child tax credit as its biggest victory the administration also wants to find ways to rid child care facilities of burdensome regulations for the democrats trying to unseat the president their solutions center on increasing funding sen elizabeth warren d mass who notes on the campaign trail that child care was one boulder that nearly crushed me as a young mother in law school has said her wealth tax would be able to fund universal child care a goal that sen bernie sanders i vt also said he supports sen amy klobuchar d minn has thrown her support behind a bill that calls for increasing the minimum wage for child care providers and making more families eligible for child care subsidies south bend indiana mayor pete buttigieg is interested in tax credits while former vice president joe biden and former housing and urban development secretary julián castro have called for universal prekindergarten entrepreneur andrew yang has cited child care costs as one expense that could be lessened through his pitch for a universal basic income forsman saw some hope in the heightened political will to address child care but it did little to help his personal challenge they had called more than a dozen places and filled out applications but the spots were all taken he felt lucky that his children s provider retired in june his wife who works as a high school guidance counselor was able to stay home with their children during the summer but they worried more each day about what they would be able to do i m not sure how we re going to fix this he recalled thinking then in september forsman drove to an old church a former artist had converted the house of worship into a child care facility and forsman figured it would be a good place to shoot a video for his ultimately successful election campaign when forsman got there he noticed a rare sight a sign hanging outside the facility asking for applications the day care center had openings a political photo opportunity had led to a personal opportunity when she said she had spots i signed my children up immediately he said i didn t even ask what the cost was it cost came out to be 1 400 a month the same cost of his monthly mortgage it was the best deal the only deal that his family could get
the chinese government is targeting israel s vehicle market china has marked out the market not because it is a critical export market that will impact china s vehicle manufacturers but because it is seen as a bridgehead for exporting large numbers of vehicles to europe along a new silk road this is in the same way that ownership of israel new haifa port is seen as an important component in china s one belt one road obor plan which aims to increase china s worldwide economic and political influence to europe and africa through port and railway infrastructures although israel s government gives away little information about the tightening of diplomatic and economic relations with china especially during an era of trade tensions between the us and china the chinese media is more forthcoming on the subject for example an editorial on december 18 published by the chinese government news agency xinhua said israel plays a vital role in promoting the chinese silk road initiative in the middle east strengthening bilateral relations between china and israel is of fundamental importance for the economic development of both countries ensuring the welfare of both peoples and upgrading their security under the bri project relations between the two countries maintain lively growth even under the shadow cast by the worldwide trade war china s ministry of commerce is actively promoting the establishment of pilot programs to establish free trade areas between the two countries while speeding up progress on signing a free trade agreement between them the signing of an overall free trade agreement between israel and china and establishing a free trade zone would have a far reaching impact on trade between the two countries in many fields and in particular the import to israel of vehicles and spare parts it would mean the cancellation of import duties which are currently imposed on chinese vehicles and spare parts for many of the western brands imported from china it would also provide a major incentive for chinese manufacturers to export their cars to israel regardless of any potential free trade agreement the chinese government is already openly encouraging its vehicle manufacturers to speed up exports to countries along the new silk road with the ultimate big prize being europe vehicle exports are a source of national pride for china s president xi jinping in particular and the chinese people in general car exports in asia and israel and eventually to europe will also provide an alternative export channel in an era of trade tensions with the us the new railway opened two years ago can carry cars across former soviet asia to europe within 18 days the railway which makes the suez canal redundant is currently being used by volvo which is owned by china s geely and chinese manufacturer saic an additional route is being built via haifa s new port currently owned by a chinese government company and jordan where china is upgrading the country s railway system this would provide a sea land route for cars to reach the gulf which is already a growing market for chinese cars israel as a trial market for chinese vehicles a second reason that china s vehicle industry is looking to israel is because the country is ideal for initial marketing and trials israel is a small but very diverse market which is greatly sensitive to price with european standards and no patriotic obstacles designed to protect a local vehicle industry israel s car customers are considered relatively sophisticated with clear western preferences and this allows new manufacturers to try out here the suitability of their products for europe however the market is also isolated enough to allow for any marketing and engineering failures to be swept under the carpet without doing any damage to the brand in europe this has happened in the past to chinese manufacturers who tried out their cars in the uk and germany another advantage of the israeli car market is the welcome embrace that china has received from government bodies which sometimes even support them with especially friendly regulations an outstanding example of this is the new regulation allowing the import of electric vehicles under a special standard with major relaxations in comparison with the european wvta standard which constitutes an expensive obstacle for many chinese car manufacturers this regulation was one of the last marks left by yisrael katz before he left the ministry of transport all this makes israel an ideal beta site for trying out new car models and a subsequent gateway to europe chinese electric cars are on the way there is a growing stream of chinese car manufacturers already entering israel all the vehicles being launched have two things in common they are being launched in israel long before their commercial launch in europe and all the manufacturers are owned directly or indirectly by the chinese government the first such government company is saic which owns the uk s mg brand which began marketing to israel through the lubinski group nearly a decade ago there are currently 5 000 saic vehicles on israel s roads the strategic breakthrough planned by saic for the next decade is the introduction of electric vehicles with the first model being the mg sz suv which is being marketed aggressively besides israel the model is only sold in europe in norway and the netherlands another even more outstanding example of the chinese enthusiasm to export cars to israel is gac china s fifth largest car manufacturer gac which imports vehicles to israel through george horesh will begin selling its electric suv model in israel in february israel will be a beta site for the vehicle which currently has no presence in dealerships in europe gac s vehicle will be launched in israel under the new special ministry of transport standard which does not comply with the full european standard a degree of success in israel will pave the way for a broader introduction into europe a third such example is dfsk a smaller semi independent manufacturer which has close ties with government vehicle manufacturer dongfeng dfsk currently has a very small presence in israel through importer telcar but from the second half of 2020 it will begin exporting to israel electric cars with a full battery range of 400 kilometers while in 2021 it will begin exporting to israel its more expensive tesla clone here too israel will be one of the first sites for the brand ahead of a more comprehensive launch in europe next stage competing in the truck market the chinese vehicles industry s inroads into israel are not just restricted to cars chinese buses with conventional and electric engines have also been leading sales in this important market in recent years and now exports also include trucks importer china motors which leads the bus market with the yotong brand plans to start selling chinese jac light trucks soon an initial consignment of about 50 trucks has already been in israel for several months and this is just the start recently taavura owned by the livnat family was awarded the import franchise for china s heavy duty national truck brand sinotruk which so far has no official presence in western markets it is a huge company with global sales of about 350 000 trucks a year 2018 about 50 more than western giants such as volvo trucks it incorporates a range of subsidiaries and brands is active in exporting to dozens of emerging economies and has manufacturing collaborations with international producers most notably germany s man the company s main expertise is in heavy duty trucks for infrastructure works but it also operates in lightweight trucks an especially popular sector in israel and in the field of trucks with natural gas and electric fueled engines this company is also receiving a huge export push from the chinese government and in may 2018 sinotruk announced a new plan aimed at exporting almost 50 of its truck output by 2020 with a stated emphasis on international marketing through the silk road project sinotruk s exports to israel are currently defined as a preliminary experimental pilot however taking into account the large market share of taavura in israel s heavy haulage and transport sector and the price sensitivity in this segment with chinese made trucks far cheaper than their european counterparts sinotruk is likely to achieve here within a few years in the truck market what chinese buses have done in the public transport market all of these examples are just the start of what is expected to reach israel along the new silk road over the next two to three years the highway is already open the foot is already on the accelerator and it is doubtful whether anyone including the americans can apply the brakes published by globes israel business news en globes co il on december 25 2019 copyright of globes publisher itonut 1983 ltd 2019
top stories in the russian press on wednesday december 25 izvestia upper house speaker vows retaliation for us scheme to stonewall nord stream 2 read also russia s pm asks government to mull measures in response to us sanctions on nord stream 2 washington s sanctions will not stop the completion of the nord stream 2 project even though the switzerland based allseas group had to halt work under its pressure speaker of the russian federation council upper house of parliament valentina matviyenko told reporters at a news conference responding to a question from izvestia this is a project which ensures energy stability for europe and is an alternative avenue to supply hydrocarbons and europeans realize that of course it will be completed and commissioned however bitter recollections will linger on she said matviyenko described the sanctions against this economic infrastructure project in distant europe as the pinnacle of absurdity stressing that russia and other countries with which washington launched an economic war would come up with tit for tat measures there is no danger that the nord stream 2 project could shut down despite washington s efforts to prevent the pipeline s construction sergei kalashnikov first deputy chairman of the federation council economic policy committee told the paper the decision by the united states and european companies can be challenged while the remaining kilometers can be covered fairly quickly and i believe we will be able to do that he said the construction of nord stream 2 can be completed by either the swiss company allseas or russia s akademik chersky pipelaying vessel igor yushkov a senior analyst at the national energy security fund explained to izvestia however the option where russia will complete the construction is less likely that s option b although many say that the allseas vessels left for good in actual fact they just floated to the german danish border where they stand and wait they did not even enter a german port the expert stressed kommersant asian powers rally around the korean peninsula the south korean japanese and chinese leaders have wrapped up their first ever summit in china s chengdu which focused on the situation on the korean peninsula and security problems in the indo pacific region kommersant writes after the dialogue between the us and north korea came to a standstill the three top asian powers took the lead their objective is to relaunch negotiations with pyongyang and prevent the korean crisis from spiraling into a hot phase although japan and south korea are among washington s leading allies in the current environment they opted for pooling efforts with beijing rather than being the us belt to contain china both seoul and tokyo view their cooperation with beijing as a strategically important window of opportunity to consolidate their positions in the region in addition to security issues whose resolution requires vigorous concerted efforts another incentive for their rapprochement is these countries determination to remove barriers to multilateral trade cooperation meanwhile former south korean ambassador to russia park ro byug who is currently the secretary general of the international conference of asian political parties icapp explained to kommersant that rapprochement between seoul and beijing was based on their geographical proximity and cultural similarities that enables them to make the most of their business cooperation as well he stressed according to the expert turning the indo pacific region into a free and safe trade zone along with energy cooperation and transport routes are all in south korea s national interests however to achieve these goals it is essential to secure an improvement in us chinese ties and positive changes in relations with north korea he concluded izvestia russia ecuador in talks over moving to settlements in rubles moscow plans to switch to settlements in rubles with ecuador several sources familiar with the situation informed izvestia they noted that negotiations between both countries diplomats government and business representatives were in progress one of the options which is currently on the table is opening a branch of a russian state run bank in the south american country and linking it to the russian central bank s system for transfer of financial messages spfs an equivalent of the swift system ecuador which has no national currency of its own uses the us dollar the us federal reserve system controls any dollar transactions so local banks are reluctant to make payments to russia because of the risk of being sanctioned an izvestia interlocutor close to the negotiations explained meanwhile a source in one of the top three state owned banks told the paper on condition of anonymity that although there is an interest in expanding ties with ecuador so far there is no final decision on easing payment rules south america is one of the most promising markets for russian exports the paper quotes vyacheslav ulasik adviser to the national committee for the assistance to economic cooperation with latin american countries as saying he recalled that none of them backed the anti russian sanctions which means that these countries are mature enough and ready to pursue an independent economic policy russian businesses are interested in stepping up cooperation and banks are likely to follow suit he noted for russia switching to settlements in rubles is an image boosting move aimed at promoting its national currency says igor nikolaev director of the fbk grant thornton strategic analysis institute russia s desire to disconnect itself from the us dollar is understandable on the other hand the dollar is convenient as a universal means of payment recognized by all thus by switching to settlements in rubles with other countries russia minimizes its risks but makes the trade process more inconvenient to some extent the expert stressed nezavisimaya gazeta us waiting for christmas present from kim jong un read also us calls on north korea to avoid provocations official the north american aerospace defense command norad has been on high alert awaiting a missile to be launched from north korea its leader kim jong un promised to present a gift to the americans if they refused to compromise at the denuclearization talks nezavisimaya gazeta writes north korea accused washington of failing to meet it halfway in response to the dprk s goodwill gestures kim made it clear that his patience was running out and warned that his country would consider itself free from its obligations if america took the wrong steps pyongyang is facing a dilemma either discontinue the dialogue with the us which president donald trump conducts taking into account how it will affect next year s presidential election or take a wait and see attitude the plenary session of the korean workers party central committee scheduled to be held in late december could shed light on that the plenary session is likely to focus on the country s foreign policy next year konstantin asmolov a leading research fellow at the russian academy of sciences institute for far eastern studies told the paper the content of the gift will be revealed there if it is a good present there is every likelihood that kim will extend a moratorium on launching icbms and nuclear tests portraying that as a sign of respect for trump as for everything else that is nuclear energy and short range missiles there were no agreements on that so north korea will continue to develop them he said concerning the prospects for dialogue they are not encouraging at all the impeachment threat is hovering over trump so it will be better for him to refrain from any abrupt moves on the north korean track the

marshall this small city in calhoun county about a 20 minute drive east from battle creek will gain a new distinction in 2020 home to the very last kmart store in michigan the discount brand was born in michigan in 1962 when detroit based retailer s s kresge co opened the first kmart big box store in garden city at kmart s peak before the retail chain s sears merger double bankruptcies shuttering of its michigan headquarters and countless rounds of store closures there were nearly 2 500 locations nationwide and 134 in michigan now there are three kmarts in the state in warren waterford and marshall by february only the store in marshall population 7 000 will remain garden city is long gone in parking lot interviews last week the store s loyal shoppers noted how the marshall kmart is the only big box retailer in the immediate area within city limits its closest direct competitor is probably dollar general the local monopoly likely helped the kmart survive you have to drive all the way to battle creek for walmart or meijers said larry lyvere 29 local officials also attribute this lack of competitors to the unusual vibrancy and surviving old time feel of marshall s downtown which has a 96 storefront occupancy rate we don t have any other big box stores they are all 15 to 20 minutes away city manager tom tarkiewicz said kmart officials won t comment about the marshall store or even say how many kmarts are left globally the busiest kmart in the world is reportedly on the u s territory of guam in the pacific ocean where the 24 hour store is thousands of miles from any walmart or target the marshall store 15861 michigan ave is situated in a shopping center at the edge of the city near i 69 along with a family fare supermarket a dollar tree a cash advance store and a rite aid

closed long ago now the marshall kmart is the only location left near them i m originally from indiana and we had kmart right at home where we shopped until they went out said mark mitchell 57 who lives about 25 miles away in springport i hope it stays i like to shop here many worried about how long the store can hang on it s sad to see this is gonna be the last one left said robert plessinger 34 of albion that means it ain t gonna be too much longer before they close it said to be profitable the shopping center including the kmart s real estate is owned by california businessman joseph choi who purchased the property for 5 45 million in 2015 according to city assessor records they do have a lease with us he said of kmart in a phone interview monday choi said a former manager at the kmart once described the store as one of the company s better performing locations earlier this year choi said he was told again that the store s sales numbers are good the kmart s immediate neighbor in the shopping center is an optometrist s office brenda hoyt the office s manager said the strip mall was especially busy until about four years ago when a secretary of state branch closed that spot is now the cash advance shop called cash store hoyt said the kmart provides an important convenience for locals you can go in and buy a birthday present if you need to without going out of town she said clothes toys projects for the kids for school you can get it here tarkiewicz the city manger said he has often heard seniors share how they like the kmart because it is not as big as some newer big box stores i ve heard from older people that walmarts and meijer stores are very overwhelming in size and this store is very maneuverable for a senior he said they like going here because it s not

contributors ramesh ponnuru bloomberg news tns kevin mccarthy the house republican leader has cast the democrats as the grinch complaining that they impeached the president just hours before christmas 123 hours to be exact speaker of the house nancy pelosi has been spending the past few days broadcasting to the world how sad she is that impeachment has proved necessary and narrowcasting to her democratic colleagues how sad they should take care to look as well as polarizing as the impeachment of donald trump has been it seems to have brought the parties together in professions of gloom many of the worries that politicians and the press have brought up are happily overblown start with the notion that impeaching trump will tear our country apart as democratic rep tulsi gabbard of hawaii said in september we heard the same lament during the impeachment of president bill clinton impeachment was bitterly divisive back then as it is now yet are 1998 and 1999 remembered as bleak years in american history no the public was more satisfied with the state of the country than before or afterward which is part of why president bill clinton wasn t removed from office more trump administration predicts pelosi will yield on impeachment delay more analysis impeachment forever changes trump s legacy more op ed trump insults rather than rebuts christianity today republicans have been warning that impeachment will cause a backlash that costs house democrats many seats in the 2020 election concern about that prospect led pelosi to resist it until the ukraine controversy arose and then to handle it quickly again the clinton precedent counsels against overreaction that impeachment was less popular than the current one and many more of the congress members who voted for it represented seats that had voted for the president in the previous election predictions of republican doom filled the airwaves the party ended up losing only two seats in the house in the next election republicans are also warning as democrats did 20 years ago that impeachment will become routine the next democratic president serving alongside a republican house will get impeached too that prediction may prove true and if presidents were to be removed for frivolous reasons it would be profoundly destabilizing but that danger seems remote because removal requires both a majority of votes in the house and two thirds of the senate impeachment has caused the departure of only one president in our history when richard nixon resigned to preempt his removal perhaps then what we should really worry about is the weakening of the impeachment power through overuse will future presidents feel less constrained by the threat of impeachment and thus more inclined to abuse their power that concern too has been raised here and there but it s not clear that fear of being removed from office has done a lot to restraint presidents before now surely presidents even the thickest of them have noticed that the removal power has never been used and that a two thirds senate majority for removal is nearly impossible to assemble vice president mike pence has called impeachment a complete waste of time keeping congress from doing the people s work journalists have speculated that impeachment would cause political paralysis to evaluate this claim we need to have a realistic baseline of what would have happened in the absence of impeachment for good or ill congress and the president were not enacting a lot of major laws before impeachment began since it did congress has agreed on a budget and the administration and china have hit pause on their trade war a refurbished north american free trade agreement is on the verge of getting through congress not only has impeachment not stopped washington from getting anything done it has probably contributed to the passage of the trade deal because some house democrats want to demonstrate they can work with the president on discrete issues even while trying to remove him from office in september trump tweeted that the markets would crash if democrats opened an impeachment inquiry instead stocks have continued to rise unemployment has kept falling too there is no sign that impeachment is disrupting the economy it didn t cause any slowdown two decades ago either there is of course a great deal that is disheartening about the spectacle of impeachment but most of it has to do with the long running decay of our institutions and the failure of our officials to fulfill their responsibilities this moment ought to be an opportunity to reflect on how we can do better what it is not is a cataclysm christmas can go on as scheduled ramesh ponnuru is a bloomberg opinion columnist he is a senior editor at national review visiting fellow at the american enterprise institute and contributor to cbs news

by david lovell swan global investments bias is tough but possible to break emerging markets across the globe continue to present investors with attractive opportunities as we enter the final days of 2019 many analysts and economists continue to highlight that equity valuations in developing nations remain far below those of listed companies in the united states this has sent a signal that there may still be considerable uncaptured value within emerging economies especially ones that are poised to benefit from dovish global monetary policies and the recent pause in international trade tensions content continues below advertisement the long perceived uncertainty and volatility within emerging markets however leads many investors to foster a strong domestic bias when allocating capital this bias often intensifies as investors approach or enter into retirement but if there was a way to retain emerging markets exposure while remaining effectively hedged it might be easier to break clients bias the long term opportunity in emerging markets while flows into the morningstar international equity category have far exceeded flows into the u s equity category over the last three years the average investors global equity allocation is still only about 22 in international equity this figure pales in comparison to the 40 for the msci world index as shown below emerging market equities present a great long term opportunity for investors seeking total return in a low yield world the developing nations that indices reflect are closely related to their more developed neighbors for example a developing country can easily take advantage of the technological breakthroughs of its more economically advanced neighbors through trade and knowledge spillover when economies like the united states are performing well they can hypothetically pull up their neighbors through expanding demand for cheaper inputs like labor that an emerging market can provide unfortunately this direct relationship can work in the opposite direction as well in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis emerging markets experienced negative external pressures on their economies such as declining trade and deleveraging by foreign banks according to the international monetary fund real output in emerging markets on average fell by 4 during the strongest part of the recession for parts of this year emerging markets were suffering from the actions of global powers the united states china trade war and other escalating political tensions have turned some financiers away from valuable developing regions investors have pulled over 1 billion out of emerging market equities according to a survey conducted by epfr global a flow tracking group emotional impact of emerging market downturns when the emerging markets take a downward turn it can happen suddenly and in dramatic fashion this table shows the largest drawdowns in the msci eem index since inception january 1988 through december 2018 during such times speculators panic and sell off their investments often at or near the trough of the asset s price emotional investing like this can impact long term success on a portfolio after selling low it can take years to catch up with investors frequently waiting too long to jump back in market timing especially in emerging markets can be detrimental to the success of a long term investment strategy instead creating a contingency plan that factors in bearish periods may minimize one s losses non traditional approach to breaking domestic bias at swan global investments we take a non traditional approach to addressing domestic bias our defined risk emerging markets strategy employs our distinct hedged equity approach to provide investors exposure to long term growth opportunities in emerging markets while hedging risks because we are focused on long term investing we use long term put options to hedge against emerging market declines like the one we were witnessing at the peak of the trade war because puts are engineered to increase in value when their underlying equity decreases in price they minimize the losses an investor can accrue during a bear market or sharp decline through this distinct counter balanced approach investors can remain always invested to participate in the upside potential in emerging markets and always hedged to mitigate risks of an unpredictable bear market while a trade war can be concerning for any investor swan global investments is confident that using long term hedges to address the systematic risk associated with volatile emerging markets is a wise strategy we believe this approach will help investors spend less time falling and catching up and therefore their capital can spend more time compounding although international investments can present a unique set of risks that investors should consider carefully adding foreign exposure can enhance portfolio diversification potentially lowering risk over long term horizons while allowing investors to take advantage of growth potential outside the united states this article was written by the team at swan global investments a participant in the etf strategist channel

on tuesday evening i reluctantly attended a neighborhood holiday party as regular readers can probably imagine that s not something i was particularly keen on but it was obligatory for one very simple reason the neighborhood is small enough that my absence wouldn t have gone unnoticed put differently it would have been manifestly rude not to show up and then there s the fact that some fraction of my board dues presumably funded the food so i felt like i should eat my money s worth even if it s been three years since i could partake in the open bar most of my neighbors and i use the scare quotes because on the whole we re pretty dispersed although there are homes on both sides of mine know what i did in a previous life even if they aren t familiar with the heisenberg brand so invariably someone will attempt to make small talk about markets although less so this year than last when us stocks were busy logging their worst december since the great depression these are usually wholly uninteresting conversations this year was no exception right up until someone s visiting son a late twenty something who apparently works as an actuary in chicago asked about the best asset allocation for a college fund he was on the verge of starting for an incoming child i have no kids which accounts for my awkward descriptions of things related to them like describing unborn children as incoming for the first time in my life i was unsure exactly how to respond for one thing it struck me as odd that an actuary wouldn t know the answer but leaving that aside this is usually the most straightforward of all straightforward questions if all that s being asked is what the allocation of a starter portfolio should be i e if we re not differentiating based on tax treatment or concerns that relate to anything other than what s in it so to speak the answer is always just 60 in an s p 500 index fund 30 in long term treasurys and the rest in some combination of gold t bills and emerging market equities we can quibble about the weights i e why only 60 when the time horizon is nearly two decades but what i just described is the safest of safe answers which works well when you re talking to someone you don t know i m a bit old school so i always recommend that folks replicate that via a couple of vanguard mutual funds and the spdr gold trust etf gld for whatever the gold allocation is but in today s world you could easily do it with an e trade account and some etfs that has the added advantage of not being subject to vanguard s account minimums which while tiny to most of us can seem large for young people starting a family and living on a budget i ll save you the suspense ultimately i did in fact resort to that boilerplate answer but only because the chances of me ever seeing that young man again are slim to none why would i hesitate in recommending that asset allocation which is literally straight out of a jack bogle book well on the stock side the answer is pretty obvious we re in the middle of what is arguably a full on melt up and the s p is sitting nearly 9 above its 200 day moving average heisenberg stocks are on track for one of their best years in decades amusingly considering the above joseph davis vanguardâ s head of investment strategy and global chief economist told bloomberg recently that equity volatility is unsustainably low and that the chances of a correction in 2020 are around 50 this post isn t so much about stocks so i ll reiterate two familiar points and then move on first 2019 s gains were all about multiple expansion see chart below and one of davis s arguments is that multiples are too rich heisenberg second earnings growth turned negative in q3 and although it s entirely reasonable to expect a modest rebound margin pressure in the form of higher input and labor costs is a concern as is an expected deceleration in buybacks heisenberg ok but we all know stocks can go higher irrespective of all the myriad good arguments why they shouldn t what isn t as clear though is that in the event they don t go higher bonds will be a good hedge us 10 year yields have fallen some 140bps over the four quarters since the local peak that is a large move in and of itself but when you consider that the peak in this case was just 3 20 it s massive heisenberg sure there are no shortage of market observers who will tell you that negative 10 year yields in the us are not only possible but likely still in the absence of further fed cuts and or an acute economic deceleration accompanied by an equally dramatic leg lower in both realized and expected inflation it s hard to imagine long end us yields making a run at zero in 2020 of course that doesn t mean bonds can t do well or that they can t serve as an effective hedge for equities in the event the latter sells off but it does mean that bonds likely to be less good hedges in a â risk offâ environment as goldman puts it for one thing there s less room for yields to fall to paraphrase the same goldman note valuations aren t necessarily a binding constraint for equities but they are for bonds goldman further given the low starting point a move higher in yields looks huge in percentage terms and while quoting moves in percent as opposed to in bps makes no sense it doesn t change the fact that the optics around the 10 year going from say 2 to 3 could be bad where that means that even if the jump were occasioned by better growth outcomes it might still cause indigestion for equities if you don t believe that just ask february 2018 or october 2018 when selloffs were preceded by what thanks to the low starting point seemed like giant leaps in bond yields so with all kinds of room for rates to sell off i e yields to rise and little in the way of scope for them to rally i e to fall one is left to worry that the bond allocation of a balanced portfolio could paradoxically become a source of considerable risk consider this passage from a goldman note dated october 2 2018 at current low yield levels and with rising inflation bonds might be less effective hedges for equities compared to the 90s they offer less repricing potential to buffer â growth shocksâ following the multi year bond bull market for bonds across markets to deliver a 20 return like during the tech bubble or gfc would require bond yields to drop to all time lows german and japan 10 year yields would have to turn deeply negative non us bonds have already become less good hedges for equities at the same time bonds have become a source of risk in case of â rate shocksâ to be sure the timing of those remarks was unfortunate bonds did in fact rally 10 months on from when that passage was written german yields for example were at 0 70 but nothing about the logic or the reasoning in that passage is even contentious let alone wrong bonds obviously have less scope to hedge a portfolio of equities unless you think yields can keep dropping forever what we don t know is how low yields can go and our assumptions on that have been proven wrong time and again what we can say with confidence though is that yields can t drop in perpetuity at some point we will reach a floor and we re by definition closer to it now than we were a decade ago all of that makes me cautious about a simple balanced portfolio in 2020 especially after this year s blockbuster performance heisenberg and yet given the returns investors have enjoyed thanks to the virtuous have your cake and eat it too dynamic i e the persistently negative stock bond return correlation that s made balanced strategies so successful over the last couple of decades i couldn t bring myself to deviate from my standard recommendation when asked how to position a starter portfolio 2018 wasn t really a balanced bear per se equities and bonds were down but the losses were tolerable and 2019 makes it an all s well that ends well situation if 2020 turns out to be the year we finally see a real balanced bear i e if both stocks and bonds log serious losses in unison i guess i ll have to skip the neighborhood christmas party

apocalyptic thinking is wrong let s not teach our children that apocalyptic thinking is right thinking says laurence siegel apocalypticism has always been wrong as a forecast and it will continue to be wrong siegel is a business consultant and the director of research at the cfa institute research foundation in fewer richer greener he argues convincingly that humanity has spent two centuries rising from our natural state of abject poverty and that most of the credit for that goes market institutions and democracy parsing current trends siegel foresees world population peaking and then stabilizing by the end of this century hence the fewer he argues that economic growth will bring humanity much greater wealth and more adept technologies hence the richer and thanks to increased urbanization and steadily improving material efficiency he thinks our species will tred more lightly on many natural ecosystems hence the greener let s take a closer look at each of those three forecasts high death rates are the cause of high birth rates explains siegel world population grew very slowly in the malthusian past because although people had lots of babies more than half of them died before reaching adulthood modern sanitation and medicine and greater supplies of food meant falling death rates that combined with still high birth rates to produce a population explosion with the number of people in the world rising from 1 billion in 1800 to 7 7 billion now the global total fertility rate that is the number of children each woman is likely to bear over her lifetime has fallen from around 5 in 1960 to 2 42 now the united nations forecasts that world s total fertility rate will eventually fall below the conventionally defined replacement rate of 2 1 children per woman the u n says population will then stabilize around 11 billion and siegel basically agrees so humanity is demographically transitioning from its natural state of high birth and high death rates to a more recent stage of high birth and low death rates to the low birth and low death rates seen in much of the world now about half of the world s population currently lives in countries with below replacement fertility the u s s total fertility rate for example has dropped to a record low of 1 73 children per woman why are more people around the world having fewer children incentives explains siegel rearing children in modern societies costs a lot both in money and in foregone opportunities and pleasures given that about 99 percent of kids born in countries like the u s will make it to age 20 parents are choosing to spend more resources on fewer children who will thereby be more likely to enjoy successful lives to put it just a little too crassly in wealthy societies and increasingly in less wealthy ones children have become a cost center some would even say a luxury good not a profit center siegel observes siegel s projections of future population growth may in fact be excessively high in a 2018 study demographer wolfgang lutz and his colleagues at the international institute for applied systems analysis offer an alternative scenario projecting rapid economic growth rising levels of educational attainment for both sexes and technological advancement all factors that tend to lower fertility they expect that world population could peak at about 8 9 billion by 2060 and then decline to 7 8 billion by the end of the century in any case these trends mean that there will be many more old people in the future having worked most of his life in finance siegel offers some good advice how to prepare for retirement he recommends that one save a predetermined percentage of one s income escalating over time until enough money has been accumulated to replace when social security benefits are also included 70 of the pay rate one has been earning just before retirement at retirement he suggests using 15 percent of your savings to buy a deferred life annuity that kicks in at age 85 thus making sure that you still have income once you ve spent down your savings as world population exploded so too did economic growth resulting in what the university of illinois at chicago economist deirdre mccloskey calls the great enrichment siegel cites urbanist jane jacobs trenchant observation poverty has no causes only prosperity has causes the economic historian angus maddison calculated that global per capita income in 1 a d was 467 per year in 1990 dollars by 1820 global per capita income had risen to nearly 1 200 per year over the next two centuries per capita gdp in current u s dollars rose to 11 300 or taking purchasing power into account to nearly 18 000 per person income of course is not equally distributed across the world some places somalia niger malawi are sadly stuck in malthusian traps where per capita incomes are still below that global average from 1 a d the good news is that economic growth has taken off in many poor countries in recent decades so their incomes are rising to converge with those of already developed nations inequality between countries is falling and the global rate of abject poverty people living on less than 1 90 per day has fallen from 42 in 1981 to 8 6 percent in 2018 by one measure half of the world s population is now middle class or wealthier siegel provides reams of solid data for similarly heartening global trends crop productivity food availability life expectancy and education are increasing violence is in decline so that explains fewer and richer but is siegel right that the world will be greener economists have identified an inverted u shaped relationship the environmental kuznets curve in which environmental conditions initially deteriorate as economic growth takes off then improve when citizens with rising incomes demand better environmental amenities for example research has found that rising incomes eventually lead to falling air and water pollution and the expansion of forests generally speaking richer is cleaner these curves do not peak and turn downward by themselves they do so with a mixture of private and government action with the details differing from one country to another in the u s the levels of six common air pollutants soot ozone lead carbon monoxide nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide have fallen by an average of 74 percent since 1970 meanwhile gross domestic product grew by 380 percent siegel acknowledges that man made climate change could pose significant problems for humanity as this century advances but he notes that billions of relatively poor people face more immediate problems including unsafe drinking water uncertain food supplies a dearth of educational opportunities excessive local pollution a lack of sanitation and importantly no access to modern energy services with respect to how best to prioritize between longer term environmental threats and fulfilling urgent needs he writes there is no single answer economic growth will help a lot siegel sees ecomodernism as the way forward to a greener world intensifying many human activities particularly farming energy extraction forestry and settlement so that they use less land and interfere less with the natural world is the key to decoupling human development from environmental impacts states an ecomodernist manifesto a document written by 18 scientists and activists in 2015 these socioeconomic and technological processes are central to economic modernization and environmental protection together they allow people to mitigate climate change to spare nature and to alleviate global poverty humanity may already be approaching peak farmland as we grow ever more food on ever less land although siegel doesn t mention it global tree cover has expanded between 1981 and 2016 by 7 percent that s a territory of about 865 000 square miles more than three times the size of texas in 1960 only one third of people lived in cities this has now increased to 55 percent making this the first time in history that more folks live in cities than in the countryside by 2050 nearly 70 percent of people will be city dwellers compact cities are much more energy efficient in addition to providing people with much better access to economic opportunities education and medical care while energy efficiency and renewables will play significant roles in helping humanity to decouple from nature siegel is also clear eyed about the need for greater supplies of energy to alleviate poverty through economic growth his solution modern nuclear power for most applications nuclear power dominates both fossil fuels and renewables in almost every aspect efficiency safety reliability carbon neutrality fuel abundance and eventually price he argues if we can maintain and spread the institutions free markets the rule of law property rights free speech and democratic governance that underpin the great enrichment siegel s forecast of fewer richer and greener will come to pass life has improved tremendously in the last 250 years this book argues that it will continue to improve in almost every dimension health wealth longevity nutrition literacy peace freedom and so forth he writes without overlooking the many obstacles on the path of progress my aim is to reinforce and help restore people s faith in the future and help them understand why optimism is amply justified reason

source bigstock as that rail and subway strike continued to paralyze travel in paris and across france into the third week president emmanuel macron made a christmas appeal to his dissatisfied countrymen strike action is justifiable and protected by the constitution but i think there are moments in a nation s life when it is good to observe a truce out of respect for families and family life macron s appeal has gone largely unheeded the public be damned seems to be the attitude of many of the workers who are tying up transit to protest macron s plan to reform a pension system that consumes 14 of gdp macron wants to raise to 64 the age of eligibility for full retirement benefits not terribly high and to set an example he is surrendering his lifetime pension that is to begin when he becomes an ex president yet it is worth looking more closely at france because she appears to be at a place where the rest of europe and america are headed in france the government collects 46 of the gdp in taxes and spends 56 of gdp the highest figures in the western world and paris appears to be bumping up against the limits of what democratic voters will tolerate in higher taxes or reductions in benefits from the postwar welfare states the west has created the u s national debt is now larger than the gdp a year ago when macron sought to raise fuel taxes to cut carbon emissions the yellow vests came out in protests that degenerated into rioting looting arson desecration of monuments and attacks on police paris capitulated and canceled the tax how do we compare the u s national debt is now larger than the gdp only in 1946 the year after world war ii was u s debt a larger share of gdp than today in 2019 the u s ran a deficit just shy of 1 trillion and the u s government projects trillion dollar deficits through the decade which begins next week and we will be running these deficits not to stimulate an economy in recession as president obama did but to pile them on top of an economy at full employment in short we are beginning to run historic deficits in a time of prosperity whatever the economic theory behind this it bears no resemblance to the limited government balanced budget philosophy of the party of ronald reagan the questions the u s will inevitably face are the ones france faces at what point does government consumption of the national wealth become too great a burden for the private sector to bear at what point must cuts be made in government spending that will be seen by the people as they are seen in france today as intolerable while a republican congress ran surpluses in the 1990s when defense spending fell following our cold war victory dwight eisenhower was the last republican president to run surpluses opposition to new or higher taxes appears to be the one piece of ground today on which republicans will not yield but if so where are the cuts going to come from that will be virtually mandated if u s debt is not to grow beyond any sustainable level america s long term problem deficits are projected to run regularly in the coming decade at nearly 5 of gdp while economic growth has fallen back to 2 with taxes off the table where when and how do we cut spending or does each new administration kick the can down the road the five principal items in the federal budget are these social security which consumes 25 of that budget yet social security outlays will reach the point this year where payroll taxes no longer cover them the trust fund will have to be raided translation the feds will have to borrow money to cover the social security deficit medicare medicaid obamacare and other health programs account for another fourth of the budget all will need more money to stay solvent defense which used to take 9 of gdp in jfk s time and 6 in ronald reagan s buildup is now down to 3 2 of gdp yet while defense s share of gdp is among the smallest since before world war ii u s commitments are as great as they were during the cold war we are now defending 28 nato nations containing russia and maintaining strategic parity we have commitments in iraq syria afghanistan and the global war on terror we defend south korea and japan from a nuclear armed north korea and china yet another major item in the budget is interest on the debt and as that u s debt surges with all the new deficits this decade and interest rates inevitably begin to rise interest on the debt will rise both in real terms and as a share of the budget again is france the future of the west
