defined in the glossary of terms and alternative performance measures on pages 61 to 64 chairman s statement performance 2018 proved to be a challenging year for high yield investors the familiar trend of ever declining yields seen in the prior years was decisively broken and yields rose steadily during the twelve months under review to put this increase in context it is worth keeping in mind that yields had fallen to exceptionally low levels in 2017 levels which by historic standards appeared increasingly detached from the long term characteristics of the asset class a number of themes weighed on the high yield market over the course of the year perhaps the main source of unease stemming from the imminent prospect of a peak in the degree of stimulus provided by quantitative easing quantitative easing whereby central banks undertake large scale purchases of assets became a common feature of g7 monetary policy post 2008 as policymakers fought to restore financial market confidence however in 2018 this stimulus slowed particularly in europe where the european central bank ecb signalled its intention to rein in its monthly program of asset purchases this change in central bank policy albeit gradual came at a time of growing uncertainty regarding the outlook for economic activity tariff increases enacted in the united states and china caused much alarm and though by november an uneasy truce was reached between president trump and china s premier xi jinping underlying tensions remained unresolved europe saw a particularly marked deceleration in economic activity and toward the end of the year familiar concerns over the long term sustainability of china s debt fuelled development model resurfaced brexit and concerns over sovereign risk in italy compounded investors unease the company s net asset value nav total return for the year was 3 6 compared with a total return of 2 4 for the ice bank of america merrill lynch european currency high yield index the index and an average return of 2 3 for funds in the investment association sterling strategic bond sector a decline in the premium to nav saw the share price return 7 6 during the year the manager has a long term horizon and consequently the board pays close attention to returns over three and five years in its assessment of investment performance for the three and five years to the end of 2018 your company s nav total return was 17 6 and 26 9 respectively compared to total returns of 15 7 and 24 9 for the index the board believes that the manager has delivered good investment performance over these periods income account dividends are a key component of the total return to shareholders and we were able to meet our dividend target of 10p in respect of the financial year paid in four equal payments the fourth dividend payment was paid on 25 february 2019 in the form of an interim dividend payment this means that it can be paid earlier than would be the case had we declared a final dividend since this would need approval at the annual general meeting your board will continue to target a dividend of 10p in the current year costs the company s ongoing charges ratio ocr for the year was 0 98 which was the same as the previous year the ocr is a measure of the expenses of managing your company and the board monitors this ratio to ensure that it remains competitive with alternative investment vehicles discount premium and issuance the company s shares traded at an average premium to net asset value of 0 4 during the year and was at a discount of 2 1 at the year end we issued a further 1 575 000 shares during 2018 shares are always issued at a premium sufficient to ensure that existing shareholders do not experience dilution of the net asset value the average price of these shares issued was 191 09p since the year end the share price has traded at a premium and a further 550 000 shares have been issued your board believes that shareholders benefit from the growth in the size of the company in two important ways first there is typically a positive correlation between a company s size and the liquidity of its shares and secondly as the company grows its fixed costs are spread over a larger base resulting in downward pressure on the ocr gearing as at 31 december 2018 the company s net cash position was 2 4 the company s policy on borrowing is determined by the board and remains unchanged the maximum amount of borrowing permitted is 30 of total assets the decision to use borrowing to gear the portfolio rests with the manager as previously reported we have established a facility to use repo financing for this purpose in place of or alongside any credit facility board composition winifred robbins retired from the board in march 2019 winifred originally joined the board of the company s predecessor cmhyt plc in march 2009 and in 2011 joined the board of the present company on behalf of the board and shareholders i would like to thank her for her excellent contribution over the years we have appointed an independent search firm to find a replacement for winifred and will update shareholders in due course governance matters in 2018 we established a management engagement committee to undertake the review of the investment management secretarial and other third party providers while this function had previously been undertaken by the board we concluded that establishing a committee to complete the review of delegated services was consistent with best practice among investment companies the management engagement committee will report to the board and is chaired by phil austin in july the financial reporting council released the 2018 corporate governance code following a lengthy consultation period the corporate governance code was first published in 1992 by the cadbury committee and over the years it has been revised and expanded investment companies such as your company have a number of distinctive features and so not all aspects of the code are relevant the association of investment companies aic subsequently published the 2019 aic code of corporate governance 2019 aic code and the company intends to comply with this code going forward one governance change we will introduce as a consequence of the 2019 aic code is to ensure that from the 2019 agm your directors will seek annual rather than triennial re election the resolutions for the re election of each of the continuing directors are detailed in the notice of meeting on page 65 in line with the 2019 aic code an outline of the reasons why their contributions and skills continue to be important to the company s long term sustainable success are included on page 58 in my 2017 chairman s statement i drew attention to the new regulations which required investment companies to publish return projections according to a series of scenarios in key information documents kids i explained that in the opinion of the board the methodology that must be used is not an appropriate way of projecting investment returns given that it relies on recent financial history this issue received considerable attention during 2018 notably from the aic which published a damning report demonstrating that kids are systematically flawed and calling for their reform let us hope that the kid methodology is replaced with something that is fit for purpose in the not too distant future agm the company s 2019 agm will be held in london at home house 20 portman square london w1h 6lw at 3 30pm on 25 june 2019 one of the managers will provide a presentation on the portfolio and investment outlook and the directors will be available to answer questions the resolutions to be put to shareholders at the meeting are described in the directors report on pages 58 and 59 they consist of the ordinary resolutions to receive this annual financial report and re appoint the auditor and the re election of directors ordinary resolutions on directors remuneration and the company s dividend payment policy are included these are advisory items of special business comprise items approved in past years by shareholders continuation of the company authority to issue shares up to 10 of the existing share capital renewal of the buy back authority and authority to call general meetings on 14 day s notice the board has considered all the resolutions proposed in the notice and believes they are in the interests of shareholders as a whole we therefore recommend shareholders vote in favour of each resolution outlook at the start of 2019 many of the key sources of economic and political uncertainty which overshadowed markets for much of the past 12 18 months appear no closer to resolution it therefore seems that trade tensions the direction of monetary policy particularly in the united states the health of the chinese economy and of course brexit will continue to preoccupy financial markets for the foreseeable future that said it is the health or otherwise of the corporate sector which is ultimately the key determinant of high yield performance and in this respect there are grounds for cautious optimism for example the economic backdrop currently appears to be one of slowdown rather than widespread or protracted recession and while corporate profit margins are likely to have peaked in 2018 their decline over the coming year seems likely to be gradual the re pricing of the market in 2018 has undoubtedly provided greater opportunities to invest in bonds which provide sufficient compensation for the risk to investors this is an encouraging development and the board is confident that your investment manager is in a strong position to exploit these opportunities within the portfolio tim scholefield chairman 3 april 2019 manager s investment report market background the past twelve months has been a difficult period for high yield bond markets with european currency high yield delivering its first year of negative return since 2011 and us high yield its first year of losses since 2015 the negative returns reflected a deterioration in sentiment attributable to multiple factors these included increasing protectionism and rising tensions over trade political risk in the eurozone concerning the italian budget deficit emerging market uncertainty brexit and in the final quarter of 2018 a 40 decline in crude oil prices at the same time markets had to adjust to less central bank stimulus the us federal reserve raised us interest rates four times the bank of england increased uk interest rates once and at the end of the year the european central bank ended its asset purchase programme there was also some company specific volatility particularly within the retail and services sectors one of the more extreme examples was house of fraser with the price of the company s 2020 bond having fallen by over 90 during the year although not held in the portfolio the price decline serves as a reminder of the potential for material losses in the high yield market nonetheless although there are some exceptions company fundamentals generally remain sound although leverage has increased from the low level of recent years interest coverage ratios the amount of times interest expense is covered by earnings remain healthy this relatively positive backdrop is reflected in default rates which remain low it is however worth bearing in mind that the repricing to higher yields observed during 2018 will slowly start to put pressure on coverage ratios as companies must refinance at higher coupons the more uncertain environment of the past year was accompanied by a fall in supply barclays report european new issuance down 38 on levels in 2017 as sentiment deteriorated issuers were forced to row back on some of the more aggressive pricing and terms that had characterised the market right at the start of the year portfolio strategy over the twelve months to 31 december 2018 the deterioration in market sentiment led the company s nav to deliver a negative total return of 3 6 a total dividend of 10p has been paid for the year the broad themes of the portfolio were unchanged over the year however the re pricing of the market provided the opportunity to build exposure to bonds we like there is a core 42 of non financial high yield corporate bonds focused on seasoned issuers that we consider have a low likelihood of default in addition we have significant exposure to areas of the market which we believe offer relatively attractive yield approximately 23 of the portfolio is invested in bank capital predominantly additional tier 1 and legacy tier 1 we also have around a 10 allocation to subordinated bonds in the insurance sector elsewhere we have 9 in hybrid capital instruments these bonds are issued with higher coupons than the issuer s senior debt instruments we believe the subordination risk of these more junior debt instruments is acceptable in the context of the companies relatively strong balance sheets outlook looking ahead the market continues to face significant potential headwinds including the withdrawal of quantitative easing brexit and ongoing trade tensions we therefore remain cautious but the repricing of recent months has we believe created value and where appropriate we will seek to exploit these opportunities the guiding principle in our investment approach is whether we are being sufficiently compensated for the risks of holding a bond to make this judgement it is important that we ensure we have an in depth understanding of a company so that we can judge whether or not it will be able to meet its financial commitments in turn this analysis enables us to better gauge the level of income we need to be paid to compensate for those risks similarly it is important to maintain a good diversification of holdings and the portfolio is currently invested in over 100 different issuers by adopting this approach we believe that we will be able to meet the challenges that the market faces and continue to deliver attractive levels of income for the company s shareholders rhys davies paul readpaul causer portfolio managers 3 april 2019 strategic report business review strategy and business model city merchants high yield trust limited is a jersey domiciled investment company and its investment objective is set out below the strategy the board follows to achieve that objective is to set investment policy and risk guidelines together with investment limits and to monitor how they are applied the business model the company has adopted to achieve its objective has been to contract investment management and administration to appropriate external service providers who are subject to oversight by the board the principal service providers are invesco fund managers limited the manager to manage the portfolio in accordance with the board s strategy and r h fund services jersey limited the secretary to provide company secretarial and general administration services in addition to the management and administrative functions of the manager and the secretary the company has contractual arrangements with link market services jersey limited to act as registrar and the bank of new york mellon international limited bnymil as depository and custodian the board has oversight of the company s service providers and monitors them on a formal and regular basis the portfolio managers responsible for the day to day management of the portfolio are paul read paul causer and rhys davies the company is an alternative investment fund for the purposes of the alternative investment fund managers directive investment objective and policy investment objective the company s investment objective is to seek to obtain capital growth and high income from investment predominantly in high yielding fixed interest securities investment policy the company seeks to provide a high level of dividend income relative to prevailing interest rates mainly through investment in bonds and other fixed interest securities the company also invests in equities and other equity like instruments consistent with the overall objective this investment policy should be read in conjunction with the descriptions of investment style investment limits derivatives and currency hedging and borrowings set out below investment style the manager seeks to ensure that the portfolio is diversified having regard to the nature and type of securities including duration credit rating performance and risk measures and liquidity and the geographic and industry sector composition of the portfolio the company may hold both illiquid securities for example securities where trading volumes are relatively low and unlisted securities and concentrated positions for example where a high proportion of the company s total assets are comprised of a relatively small number of investments investment limits the company may invest in fixed interest securities including but not restricted to preference shares loan stocks convertible and redeemable corporate bonds and government stocks up to 100 of total assets investments in equities may be made up to an aggregate limit of 20 of total assets the aggregate value of holdings of shares and securities in a single issuer or company including a listed investment company or trust will not exceed 15 of the value of the company s investments and investments in unlisted investments will not exceed 10 of the company s total assets for individual holdings and 25 in aggregate all the above limits are measured at the time a new investment is made derivatives and currency hedging the company may enter into derivative transactions including options futures contracts for difference credit derivatives and interest rate swaps for the purposes of efficient portfolio management the company will not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes efficient portfolio management may include reduction of risk reduction of cost and enhancement of capital or income through transactions designed to hedge all or part of the portfolio to replicate or gain synthetic exposure to a particular investment position where this can be done more effectively or efficiently through the use of derivatives than through investment in securities or to transfer risk or obtain protection from a particular type of risk which might attach to portfolio investments the company may hedge against exposure to changes in currency rates to the full extent of any such exposure borrowings the company s borrowing policy is determined by the board which has set a maximum of 30 of the company s total assets this limit may be varied from time to time in the light of prevailing circumstances but has not been changed since the company s incorporation in its current form the manager has discretion to borrow within the limit set by the board any borrowings are covered by investments in matching currencies to manage exposure to exchange rate fluctuations the board has reviewed the methods of financing available to the company including repo financing whereby a company participates in sale and repurchase arrangements in connection with its portfolio under these arrangements a company sells fixed interest securities and is contractually obliged to repurchase them at a fixed price on a fixed date whilst retaining economic exposure to the securities sold the difference between the lower sale price and the later purchase price is the cost effectively interest of the repo financing repo financing agreements are in place and may be used in place of or alongside any credit facility arranged by the company subject to the aggregate 30 ceiling the company did not use repo financing during the year to 31 december 2018 2017 none key performance indicators the board reviews performance by reference to a number of key performance indicators which include the following performance dividends premium discount ongoing charges ratio performance as the company s objective is to seek to obtain capital growth and high income the performance is best measured in terms of total return there is no single index against which the company s performance may be meaningfully assessed therefore the board refers to a variety of relevant data and this is reflected in both the chairman s statement and the manager s investment report on pages 3 to 6 the manager has a long term horizon and consequently the board pays close attention to returns over three and five years in its assessment of investment performance as explained in the chairman s statement the board has noted the under performance in the year and is satisfied with the longer term performance of the portfolio when considering historical returns the terms of the reconstruction in 2012 allow direct comparison of the company s financial information with that of its predecessor city merchants high yield trust plc it is therefore appropriate to combine the information from both companies and the graph on page 9 of the annual financial report shows the performance of the share price and net asset value both on a total return basis for the last ten years dividends and dividend payment policy dividends form a key component of the total return to shareholders and the board currently targets dividends of 10p per year this target has been met in the year under review dividends paid over the last ten years are shown in the table on page 2 the board s dividend payment policy is to pay dividends on a regular quarterly basis in may august november and february in respect of each accounting year the timing of these regular three monthly payments means that shareholders do not have an opportunity to vote on a final dividend recognising the importance of shareholder engagement and although not required by any regulation shareholders are given an opportunity to vote on this policy at the forthcoming agm premium discount the board monitors the price of the company s shares in relation to their net asset value and the premium discount at which the shares trade the board has limited influence on the price at which the company s shares trade powers are taken each year to issue and buy back shares which can assist short term management however the level of discount or premium is mostly a function of investor sentiment and demand for the shares the ideal would be for the shares to trade close to their net asset value the graph on page 9 of the annual financial report shows the premium discount through the year ending with a discount of 2 1 as explained in the chairman s statement demand for shares during the year resulted in the issue of 1 575 000 shares at an average price of 191 09p ongoing charges ratio the expenses of managing the company are carefully monitored by the board the standard measure of these is the ongoing charges ratio which is calculated by dividing the sum of such expenses over the course of the year including those charged to capital by the average net asset value this ongoing charges ratio provides a guide to the effect on performance of annual operating costs the company s ongoing charges ratio for the current year was 0 98 the same as for the previous year investment process at the core of the portfolio managers philosophy is a belief in active investment management they seek to invest where they see the potential for attractive returns and to avoid risks that they do not think are well rewarded fundamental principles drive a genuinely unconstrained investment approach with a strong emphasis on value the investment process comprises four key elements to deliver the information the portfolio managers use to make their decisions top down macroeconomic analysis examining the factors that shape the economy credit analysis using internal and external research with a view to maximising returns from acceptable and understood credit risk exposure value assessment considering the risk return profile of any bond in relation to cash core government bonds and the rest of the fixed interest universe and risk considerations analysing all holdings to allow for a comprehensive understanding of risks involved to ensure diversification of the portfolio the portfolio managers enter into the majority of positions with a view to holding them until their call or maturity date and their investment process is based on making investments where the yield to maturity or call appears to them to be at least an adequate reward for the risk the nature of the high yield market and the company s mandate mean that there will be occasions when the value the portfolio manager assessed in an investment is fully realised through capital appreciation or when an existing investment comes to appear overvalued by the market on these occasions they may exit the position before maturity the portfolio managers believe that it is good investment practice to try and keep the level of turnover to a minimum whilst at the same time recognising that this should not at any time act as a deterrent to effective portfolio management the closed end nature of the company means the portfolio managers are not presented with regular daily inflows and outflows and as such are not required to turn the portfolio over to manage liquidity turnover will generally be very low due to the long term nature of many of the holdings and the company structure internal control and risk management the directors have overall responsibility for the company s system of internal controls and are responsible for reviewing the effectiveness of these controls this includes safeguarding of the company s assets the directors have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the company including those that would threaten its business model future performance solvency or liquidity the audit committee the committee on behalf of the board has established an ongoing process for identifying and assessing the risks to which the company is exposed by reference to a risk control summary which maps the risks mitigating controls in place and monitoring and reporting of relevant information to it as part of the process the committee has identified four risk categories strategic investment management third party service providers and regulation and corporate governance an explanation of these categories follows strategic risk the board sets the company s strategy including setting its objective and how this should be achieved the board assesses the performance of the company in the context of the market and macro conditions and gives direction to and monitors the manager s actions and those of other third parties on behalf of the company investment management risk investment management covers management of the portfolio together with cash management gearing and hedging all being areas the portfolio managers can control and which generate the company s investment performance third party service providers risk the company has no employees and its directors are appointed on a non executive basis the company is reliant on third party service providers tpps for its executive functions the company s most significant tpps are the manager to which portfolio management is delegated and the secretary other significant tpps are the corporate broker depositary custodian registrar and auditor regulation and corporate governance risk the company is required to comply with many regulations for the year under review these included but were not limited to the provisions of the companies jersey law 1991 the uk listing rules the alternative investment fund managers directive the market abuse regulation the fca s disclosure guidance and transparency rules the uk corporate governance code and international financial reporting standards a matrix of the risks set out according to their assessed risk levels after mitigation enables the directors to concentrate on those risks that are most significant and also forms the basis of the list of principal risks and uncertainties on pages 12 and 13 the ratings take into account the directors risk appetite and the ongoing monitoring by the manager oversight of the control environment is based on the company s relationship with its tpps all of which have clearly defined lines of responsibility delegated authority and control procedures and systems the company s main third party service providers the manager and the secretary both have a three lines of defence model which is embedded into their risk management systems the effectiveness of the company s internal control and risk management system is reviewed at least twice a year by the committee the committee received and considered together with representatives of the manager reports in relation to operations and systems of internal controls of the manager accounting administrator custodian and registrar the committee also receives regular reports from the manager s internal audit and compliance departments the committee also received a comprehensive and satisfactory report from the depositary at the year end committee meeting the company s risk management policies and procedures for financial instruments are set out in note 18 on pages 49 to 54 due diligence is undertaken before any contracts are entered into with any third party service provider the manager regularly reviews against agreed service standards the performance of tpps through formal and informal meetings and by reference to third party independently audited control reports the results of the manager s reviews are reported to and reviewed by the committee these various reports and reviews did not identify any significant failings or weaknesses which were relevant to the company during the year and up to the date of this annual financial report if any had been identified the required remedial action would have been taken reporting to the board at each board meeting comprises but is not limited to financial reports including any hedging and gearing performance against relevant indices and the company s peers the portfolio managers review including of the market the portfolio transactions and prospects revenue forecasts and investment monitoring against investment guidelines the portfolio managers are permitted discretion within these investment guidelines which are set by the board compliance with the guidelines is monitored daily by the manager any proposed variation to these guidelines is referred to the board for consideration and approval the board formally reviews the performance of the manager and the secretary annually and informally at every board meeting the board has reviewed and accepted both the manager s and secretary s whistleblowing policy under which staff of both invesco fund managers limited and r h fund services jersey limited can in confidence raise concerns about possible improprieties or irregularities in matters affecting the company principal risks and uncertainties the board has carried out a robust assessment of the risks facing the company including those that would threaten its business model future performance solvency and liquidity the principal risks that follow are those identified by the board after consideration of mitigating factors in carrying out this assessment consideration was given to market uncertainty in relation to brexit strategic risks market risk the risk the company invests primarily in fixed interest securities the majority of which are traded on global security markets the principal risk for investors in the company is a significant fall and or a prolonged period of decline in these markets this could be triggered by unfavourable developments globally and or in one or more regions the board cannot control the effect of such external influences on the portfolio market risk also arises from movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates mitigating procedures and controls an explanation of market risk and how this is addressed is given in note 18 1 to the financial statements investment objectives the risk the company s investment objectives and structure no longer meet investors demands mitigating procedures and controls the board receives regular reports reviewing the company s investment performance against its stated objectives and peer groups and reports from discussion with its broker and major shareholders the board also has a periodic strategy meeting lack of liquidity in the company s shares the risk lack of liquidity and lack of marketability of the company s shares leading to stagnant share price and wide discount mitigating procedures and controls the board receives regular reports from both the manager and the company s broker on the company s share price performance and level of discount or premium together with regular reports on marketing and meetings with shareholders and prospective investors the board recognises the importance of the company s scale in terms of the aggregate value of its shares in the market market cap in creating liquidity and the benefit of a wide shareholder base and has the ability to both issue and buy back shares to assist with market volatility the foundation to this lies in solid investment performance and a high level of dividend powers are also taken to issue and buy back shares investment management risk performance the risk the portfolio persistently underperforms relevant indices and or peers because of the investments selected performance will also be affected by market risk which was addressed above and by credit risk a significant portion of the company s portfolio consists of non investment grade securities which by their nature have a higher risk of default as well as the likelihood of price volatility mitigating procedures and controls the company does not have a formal benchmark however the ice bank of america merrill lynch european currency high yield index the index is used in contribution analysis this index tracks the performance of eur and gbp denominated sub investment grade corporate debt publicly issued in the eurobond sterling domestic and euro domestic markets the board regularly compares the company s nav performance over both the short and long term to that of the index and relevant peers as well as reviewing analyses breaking out contributory elements of the portfolio s performance compared with the index the board also receives reports on and reviews the constituents of the portfolio transactions in the period and if applicable gearing and hedging the investment process the portfolio managers employ to address risk versus return is explained on page 10 and an explanation of credit risk and how this is addressed is given in note 18 3 to the financial statements borrowing risk the risk borrowings for investment purposes will amplify the reduction in nav in a falling market which in turn is likely to adversely affect the company s share price there is no guarantee that it will be possible to re finance repo financing arrangements or replace any other borrowing facilities on their maturity either at all or on terms that are acceptable to the company in which case any amounts owing by the company would need to be funded by the sale of investments and the company may not be able to realise the expected value of those assets repo financing introduces an element of counterparty risk repo financing transactions require the counterparty to sell the relevant assets to the company on the repurchase date at a fixed price but if a counterparty failed to do so the company would be left with a contractual claim against the defaulting counterparty and there is no guarantee the company would be able to recover all of the value of the assets from that counterparty in adverse market conditions the risks of counterparty default may be greater than at other times mitigating procedures and controls all borrowings are actively managed by the manager and monitored by the board the company will only enter into repo arrangements with counterparties who are authorised or regulated by an appropriate regulator and whose credit rating is not less than the minimum investment grade credit ratings issued by internationally recognised agencies there is a maximum limit allowed with any one counterparty and transactions typically have a maturity tenor of three months or less third party service providers risk unsatisfactory performance of third party service providers tpps the risk failure by any service provider to carry out its obligations to the company in accordance with the terms of its appointment could have a materially detrimental impact on the operations of the company and affect its ability to successfully pursue its investment policy and expose it to reputational risk disruption to the accounting payment systems or custody records could prevent the accurate reporting and monitoring of the company s financial position mitigating procedures and controls details of how the board monitors the services provided by the manager and the other tpps and the key elements designed to provide effective internal control are included in the internal control and risk management section on pages 10 and 11 information technology resilience and security the risk the company s operational structure means that all cyber risk information technology and physical security arises at its tpps this cyber risk includes fraud sabotage or crime perpetrated against the company or any of its tpps mitigating procedures and controls the audit committee on behalf of the board regularly reviews tpps audited service organisation control reports and meets with representatives of the manager s investment management compliance internal audit and investment trust teams as well as the secretary s senior staff and compliance team the board receives regular updates on the manager s and the secretary s information security the board monitors tpps business continuity plans and testing including their regular live testing of workplace recovery arrangements regulation and corporate governance risk failure to comply with or adverse changes to law or regulation the risk a serious breach of law or regulation could lead to suspension from the official list and from trading on the london stock exchange a fine or a qualified audit report adverse changes to law or regulation could affect the ability of the company to operate or the practicality of its domicile mitigating procedures and controls the board the secretary and the manager monitor compliance with and changes to government policy legislation and other regulations relevant to the company viability statement this company is an investment company whose business consists of investing the pooled funds of its shareholders to provide them with capital growth and a high income over the long term predominantly from a portfolio of high yielding fixed income securities long term for this purpose is considered to be at least five years and the directors have assessed the company s viability over that period however the life of the company is not intended to be limited to that or any other period the main risk to the company s continuation is shareholder dissatisfaction through failure to meet the company s investment objective through poor investment performance or the investment policy not being appropriate in prevailing market conditions either of which could affect the demand for and liquidity of the company s shares accordingly failure to meet the company s investment objective and contributory market and investment risks are deemed by the board to be principal risks of the company and are given particular consideration in the continuing assessment of its long term viability the company s investment objective and policy are kept under review in essence they are the same as they have been since the company commenced trading in 2012 which in turn were unchanged from those of the company s uk based predecessor city merchants high yield trust plc the continued relevance of the investment objective and policy are underlined by the company s annual continuation vote last year nearly 100 of the votes registered were in favour of continuation and the board has no reason to believe that the continuation resolution will not be passed at the forthcoming and subsequent agms performance derives from returns for risk taken the manager s investment report on page 6 sets out the current investment strategy of the portfolio managers the portfolio contains a high level of relatively high yielding non investment grade bonds and these carry a higher risk of default than investment grade paper this is discussed further in note 18 to the financial statements the board has adopted investment limits within which the portfolio managers operate the directors and the portfolio managers constantly monitor the portfolio its ratings and default risk a bond rating analysis of the portfolio at the year end is shown on page 18 exposure is weighted towards higher quality issuers where the risk of default is considered to be more remote the terms of the company s corporate transition in 2012 allow direct comparison of the company s financial information with its uk predecessor taking the two together performance has been strong for many years through different and difficult market cycles as shown by the ten year total return performance graph on page 9 the investment policy has effectively been stress tested by market events in 2007 8 and earlier cycles and in recent times by both global and domestic events these events affected performance but at no time did they threaten the viability of the company whilst past performance may not be indicative of performance in the future the investment policy has been consistent and the company s portfolio managers overseen by the board have been in place throughout those past periods performance and demand for the company s shares are not things that can be forecast but there are no current indications that either or both of these may falter materially over the next five years so as to affect the company s viability as described in note 18 2 to the financial statements on page 53 liquidity risk is

well as any cash borrowings other receivables and other payables the following note explains the risks that affect the company s financial instruments and looks at the company s exposure to these various risks risk management policies and procedures the strategic report details the company s approach to investment management risk on page 12 and the accounting policies in note 2 explain the company s valuation basis for investments and currency as an investment company the company invests in loan stocks corporate bonds government stocks preference shares and equities which are held for the long term in order to achieve the company s investment objective in accordance with its investment policy in pursuing these the company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in either a reduction in the company s net assets or a reduction in the profits available for payment as dividends the company s principal financial instruments at risk comprise its investment portfolio other financial instruments at risk include cash and cash equivalents borrowings other receivables and other payables that arise directly from the company s operations the company may enter into derivative transactions for efficient portfolio management derivative instruments can be highly volatile and expose investors to a high risk of loss where used to hedge risk there is a risk that the return on a derivative does not exactly correlate to the returns on the underlying investment obligation or market sector being hedged against if there is an imperfect correlation the company may be exposed to greater loss than if the derivative had not been entered into during the year the only derivatives entered into were forward currency contracts these risks and the directors approach to managing them are set out below and have not changed from those applying in the comparative year risk management is an integral part of the investment management process the manager controls risk by ensuring that the company s portfolio is appropriately diversified and the portfolio managers actively monitor both the ratings and liquidity of the fixed interest securities taking into account the company s financing requirements in depth and continual analysis of market and security fundamentals give the portfolio managers the best possible understanding of the risks associated with a particular security the portfolio managers assess the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitor the overall level of market risk on the whole of the portfolio on an ongoing basis high yield fixed interest securities are subject to a variety of risks including credit risk 18 3 borrowing using the company s credit facility increases the company s exposure to interest rate risk and this is explained under interest rate risk 18 1 2 the day to day management of the investment activities borrowings and hedging of the company has been delegated to the manager and is the responsibility of the portfolio managers to whom the board has given discretion to operate within set guidelines any proposed variation outside those guidelines is referred to the board and the guidelines themselves are reviewed at every board meeting 18 1 market risk market risk arises from changes in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument because of movements in market prices market risk comprises three types of risk currency risk 18 1 1 interest rate risk 18 1 2 and other price risk 18 1 3 18 1 1 currency risk the company has assets liabilities and income which are denominated in currencies other than sterling and movements in exchange rates will affect the sterling value of those items management of the currency risk the board meets at least quarterly to assess risk and review investment performance the portfolio managers monitor the company s exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis and is reviewed by directors at each board meeting the company may use forward currency contracts to mitigate currency risk drawings in foreign currencies on the borrowing facility can also be used to limit the company s currency exposure and to achieve the portfolio characteristics that assist the company in meeting its investment objective and policy all facility drawings and derivative contracts are limited to currencies and amounts commensurate with asset exposure to those currencies income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt the company does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements and its receipt currency exposure the fair values of the company s monetary items that have foreign currency exposure at

during the year reported because the levels of monetary foreign currency exposure may change significantly throughout the year currency sensitivity the effect on the statement of comprehensive income and the net asset value that changes in exchange rates have on the company s financial assets and liabilities is based on the following currencies these changes have been calculated by reference to the volatility of exchange rates during the period using the standard deviation of currency fluctuations against the mean 2018 2017 euro 1 0 2 3 us dollar 3 6 2 9 the following sensitivity analysis is based on the company s monetary foreign currency financial instruments held at the balance sheet date taking account of any forward foreign exchange contracts that offset the effects of changes in currency exchange rates and the income receivable in foreign currency in the year if sterling had strengthened by the changes in exchange rates shown above this would have had the following effect us

bank of japan practically a part of the government amount to more than 80 this is consistent with the good stability of a strong yen and very low long term prime rates on the other hand the u s faces deepening structural vulnerabilities in stocks that have resulted from the bankruptcy of lehman brothers in 2008 and the ensuing financial crisis while experiencing a transitory booming in flows also the e u remains mired not only in serious structural vulnerabilities but also in a persistent recession consequently both the u s and the e u have a significantly less free hand in foreign economic policy while keeping themselves busy to obtain or retain comparative gains through their strategic interaction most notably in trade with the quantitative tightening of the u s the e u and finally the japanese central banks brics and other major developing economies encounter increasing difficulties in financing for investment and growth compounded by the shrinking of their u s and european export outlets particularly the chinese yuan is effectively pegged with the u s dollar while china s money supply in yuan is in fact based on its dollar reserves consequently china is sliding into a serious recession aggravated by the intense trade war with the u s no wonder that last october china made an abrupt about face on its persistent anti japan policy and concluded the currency swap agreement with japan that would surely furnish china with 3 trillion japanese yen or less than 270 billion u s dollars in the event of an acute liquidity crisis looking closely at the recent japan china interaction japan s quiet rise is more conspicuous for several years prior to the official reconciliation of october 2018 the two countries appeared to geo economically compete head to head centered on aid and development according to china s one belt one road strategy and japan s counter strategy or free and open indo pacific strategy china is undergoing serious setbacks because many recipient investee states have cancelled cut down or postponed china sponsored development projects these states have suffered china s debt trap and many of the projects have turned out be financially environmentally and socially unsustainable china is increasingly constrained to finance development projects due to the hardly discernible yet significant dwindling of its dollar reserves that is statistically covered up by its foreign borrowings certainly china has succeeded in luring more than ninety developing and developed countries with its huge fabricated foreign reserves as show money to participate in the china led asian infrastructure investment bank but the country has failed to secure the aiib memberships of japan and the united states respectively the world s largest credit nation and the key currency nation with most developed financial and bonds markets without sufficient funds and staffs the aiib cannot but co finance projects with the world bank and the asian development bank to obtain a favorable credit rating necessary for financing though international financial markets in contrast japan has demanded china to observe international standards in aid and development and only agreed in october 2018 to selectively coordinate its policy with china only when the country meets these stringent conditions there has been no major successful coordination case between the two to date given that many of traditional japanese aid recipients are no longer low income countries the japanese approach will necessarily focus more on high quality aid and development in terms of sustainability through the public private sector cooperation the approach will be superior to china s at least over a medium to long run additionally japan plays a leading role to preserve the existing free and open international economic system against the tide of populism and protectionism most notably u s president donald trump s america first japan successfully led the formation of the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership after the u s made an abrupt exit from an early tpp in the making and concluded the japan eu economic partnership agreement in nutshell japan s geo economic power and influence will be outstanding at least for a mid term yet the country is not free from serious risks and problems for a short term japan s rise will remain quiet and perhaps unnoticeable especially because its geo economic power and influence may be reduced by geo political risks and crises and because its vested bureaucratic interests hamper consolidation of its huge public debts and assets which involves the great risk of a liquidity crisis for a long term japan needs to find out a societal equation to cope with an unprecedented low birthrate and a high longevity rate the world must stay tuned on humdrum japan source this article was published by modern diplomacy

remained tilted to the downside it said a drawn out or deteriorating trade conflict between the people s republic of china and the united states could undermine investment and growth in developing asia with various uncertainties stemming from us fiscal policy and a possible disorderly brexit growth in the advanced economies could turn out slower than expected undermining the outlook for the

though she still emphasized that we do not see a recession in the near term but there will be pickup in h2 2019 and into 2020 she outlined three areas of policy actions needed a domestic policies to build more resilient and inclusive economies b cross border efforts to provide a more level playing field c partnership to address global challenges in particular she said tariffs between us and china went up by 25 and that alone would reduce annual gdp by up to 0 6 percent in the us and by up to 1 5 percent in china she urged that these are potentially self inflicted wounds that should be avoided

geneva world trade shrank by 0 3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018 and is likely to grow by 2 6 percent this year slower than 3 0 percent growth in 2018 and below a previous forecast of 3 7 percent the world trade organization said on march 2 in its annual forecast the wto said trade had been weighed down by new tariffs and retaliatory measures weaker economic growth volatility in financial markets and tighter monetary conditions in developed countries it forecast in september that 2018 growth would be 3 9 percent down from 4 6 percent in 2017 wto director general roberto azevedo told a news conference that the lower forecast was no surprise given the trade tensions between the united states and china wto chief economist robert koopman said worse may be to come with an even bigger impact if u s president donald trump goes ahead with a plan to impose high tariffs on global imports of cars later this year u s china trade is about 3 percent of global trade said koopman automobile trade globally is about 8 percent of global trade so you can imagine that the impact of automobile tariffs is going to be bigger than the impact of the u s china trade conflict i think it s pretty clear that any automobile tariff would likely have bigger knock on effects through the global economy than what we see from the u s china conflict koopman brexit uncertainty the wto did not make a specific prediction about the impact of brexit but koopman said in the worst case it would help push global trade growth down to the bottom end of the wto s forecast range in 2019 1 3 to 4 0 percent the uk s own analysis suggests that no deal or hard brexit would shave 7 6 percent off british gdp that would be a big number it would force our numbers down to that lower part of our range koopman said if we end up in the fall with a revision my guess is the likelihood of a revision is that it s downward based on any number of factors from brexit to no resolution in the u s china trade conflict and other trade conflicts going on although the volume of global trade grew only slowly in 2018 the dollar value rose 10 percent to 19 48 trillion partly because oil prices rose 20 percent the wto said the value of commercial services trade grew by 8 percent to 5 80 trillion in 2018 driven by strong import growth in asia goods trade volumes are expected to grow more strongly in developing economies this year with 3 4 percent growth in exports compared with 2 1 percent in developed economies growth in asia growth in developing asia could slow for a second straight year in 2019 and lose further momentum in 2020 the asian development bank adb said on april 3 developing asia which groups 45 countries in the asia pacific region is expected to grow 5 7 this year the adb said in its asian development outlook report slowing from a projected 5 9 percent expansion in 2018 and 6 2 percent growth in 2017 the 2019 forecast represents a slight downgrade from its december forecast of 5 8 percent for 2020 the region is forecast to grow 5 6 percent which would be the slowest since 2001 a drawn out or deteriorating trade conflict between the people s republic of china and the united states could undermine investment and growth in developing asia yasuyuki sawada adb s chief economist said in a statement the lender also cited uncertainties stemming from u s fiscal policy and a possible disorderly brexit as risks to its outlook because they could slow growth in advanced economies and cloud the outlook for the world s second largest economy though abrupt increases in u s interest rates appear to have ceased for the time being policy makers must remain vigilant in these uncertain times sawada said chinese economy china s economy will probably grow 6 3 percent this year the adb said unchanged from its december projection but slower than the country s 6 6 percent expansion in 2018 despite recent government stimulus measures including more tax cuts and increased state spending on infrastructure growth in the chinese mainland is projected to cool further to 6 1 percent in 2020 beyond trade risks the adb said china s growth will also be retrained by restrictions on shadow banking which is expected to limit credit expansion even as fiscal stimulus provides some offset i should emphasize although the government would like to stabilize growth it wouldn t want to push up the growth rate as in previous years when you saw a big stimulus package like in the period of 2008 2009 said jian zhuang senior economist at adb in beijing chinese banks may still remain reluctant to lower lending costs for companies partly on worries of rising risks of corporate defaults in a slowing economy the central bank could take further actions such as cutting the benchmark 1 year lending and deposit rates the adb said china has set its 2019 economic growth target at 6 0 to 6 5 percent by region south asia will remain the fastest growing in asia pacific with the adb predicting an expansion of 6 8 percent this year lower than its previous forecast of 7 1 percent and 6 9 percent next year from an estimated 7 0 percent growth in 2018 india s economy is projected to expand at a faster pace of 7 2 percent in 2019 and 7 3 percent in 2020 the adb said as lower policy rates and income support to farmers boost domestic demand this year s growth forecast for southeast asia was trimmed to 4 9 percent from an earlier estimate of 5 1 percent as the manila based lender expect malaysia singapore philippines and thailand to grow slower than previously thought next year southeast asia is predicted to grow 5 0 percent citing stable commodity prices the adb lowered its average inflation forecast for developing asia to 2 5 percent this year from 2 7 percent previously and it is expected to remain subdued at 2 5 percent in 2020 by tom miles and karen lema

central bank warns budget deficit must be reined in says next gov t will have to cut spending raise taxes finance ministry says deficit is not a big problem says israel has reduced its debt ratio over past decade by steven scheer and tova cohen jerusalem april 3 reuters israel s economy has barely featured in the run up to next week s general election yet the central bank and many economists warn the new government will need to cut spending and raise taxes to rein in a growing budget deficit the pre election debate has been dominated by security issues and the possible indictments facing prime minister benjamin netanyahu in corruption cases opinion polls ahead of the april 9 vote suggest a close race between the premier s right wing likud party and the centrist blue and white party advertisement advertisement netanyahu who has been in office for a decade has long touted the economic successes of israel indeed growth is robust unemployment is low the israeli high tech sector is second only to silicon valley globally and foreign investment is strong however he and his finance minister moshe kahlon have cut taxes while spending generously on policies like pay rises for police and subsidies for kindergartens in recent years leading to a widening budget deficit now the bank of israel and many economists warn that the economy is set to slow as a result of weaker global growth which would hit israeli exports the central bank which has started a gradual process of raising interest rates said the next government would have to cut spending in coming months as well as raise some taxes analysts expect the spending reductions and tax hikes to reach 10 12 billion shekels 2 8 3 3 billion to narrow this year s budget gap advertisement advertisement the government that will be chosen will have to make fiscal adjustments said bank of israel governor amir yaron he added these steps should be taken when the economy was in good shape as they would be tougher to implement if conditions worsened the grey clouds on the horizon should not be ignored he said on sunday referring to reductions in global growth forecasts a higher budget deficit and public debt reduce the ability of a country to withstand economic shocks like another financial crisis and can also threaten its credit rating and borrowing costs ratings agencies fitch and s p said israel was not at risk of a downgrade in the near term but also stressed the next government would have to take steps to rein in the deficit advertisement advertisement the country s budget deficit is projected by analysts to rise to close to 4 percent of gross domestic product this year above a target of 2 9 percent the deficit was 2 9 percent of gdp in 2018 widening to 3 5 percent in the 12 months to february this year the central bank believes the state must stick to a deficit target of 2 5 percent of gdp at 3 percent the public debt burden would rise from a current level of 61 percent to 65 percent of gdp by 2025 or as much as 75 percent should the economy worsen yaron warned the finance ministry which expects a budget deficit of at least 3 5 percent this year says the situation is being blown out of proportion noting israel is one of the only western countries to have reduced its debt ratio over the past decade there is a gap of 6 billion shekels that we need to close in a budget of 400 billion shekels it s not a big problem and certainly not a catastrophe shai babad the ministry s director general told reuters we are monitoring it when you have 37 8 celsius fever you don t go to surgery advertisement advertisement by comparison the u s deficit is expected to be 5 percent of gdp in 2019 france s deficit 2 8 percent spain s 2 3 percent britain s 1 7 percent and germany s 1 5 percent according to international monetary fund estimates put brakes on the next israeli government is likely to be in place by late may leader capital markets chief economist jonathan katz said the new administration could implement so called fiscal consolidation measures in two stages in the middle of this year and then in early 2020 i don t think they will necessarily have to cut immediately the budget by 12 billion shekels and raise taxes to put the brakes on right away and sharply i think they have the leeway to do it in two stages he said advertisement advertisement the budget should have been balanced by 2017 when you are at full employment and this would allow you fiscal tools to expand spending during a slowdown finance ministry chief babad said updated forecasts for state income and expenses would be available in june when the ministry would determine if action was needed the 2020 state budget is expected to be ready for a cabinet vote by early august he added he said if there was an issue with israel s fiscal policies global rating agencies would be more concerned last week fitch affirmed its sovereign debt rating of a with a stable outlook but believes the new government must take steps to narrow the budget deficit advertisement advertisement similarly standard poor s last year raised its rating to aa from a also with a stable outlook it affirmed the rating in february if the fiscal slippage or relaxation of fiscal performance were to be repeated or happen consistently we might conclude that there is a shift in the government s fiscal stance said karen

photo by steven scheer and tova cohen jerusalem reuters israel s economy has barely featured in the run up to next week s general election yet the central bank and many economists warn the new government will need to cut spending and raise taxes to rein in a growing budget deficit the pre election debate has been dominated by security issues and the possible indictments facing prime minister benjamin netanyahu in corruption cases opinion polls ahead of the april 9 vote suggest a close race between the premier s right wing likud party and the centrist blue and white party netanyahu who has been in office for a decade has long touted the economic successes of israel indeed growth is robust unemployment is low the israeli high tech sector is second only to silicon valley globally and foreign investment is strong however he and his finance minister moshe kahlon have cut taxes while spending generously on policies like pay rises for police and subsidies for kindergartens in recent years leading to a widening budget deficit now the bank of israel and many economists warn that the economy is set to slow as a result of weaker global growth which would hit israeli exports the central bank which has started a gradual process of raising interest rates said the next government would have to cut spending in coming months as well as raise some taxes analysts expect the spending reductions and tax hikes to reach 10 12 billion shekels 2 8 3 3 billion to narrow this year s budget gap the government that will be chosen will have to make fiscal adjustments said bank of israel governor amir yaron he added these steps should be taken when the economy was in good shape as they would be tougher to implement if conditions worsened the grey clouds on the horizon should not be ignored he said on sunday referring to reductions in global growth forecasts a higher budget deficit and public debt reduce the ability of a country to withstand economic shocks like another financial crisis and can also threaten its credit rating and borrowing costs ratings agencies fitch and s p said israel was not at risk of a downgrade in the near term but also stressed the next government would have to take steps to rein in the deficit the country s budget deficit is projected by analysts to rise to close to 4 percent of gross domestic product this year above a target of 2 9 percent the deficit was 2 9 percent of gdp in 2018 widening to 3 5 percent in the 12 months to february this year the central bank believes the state must stick to a deficit target of 2 5 percent of gdp at 3 percent the public debt burden would rise from a current level of 61 percent to 65 percent of gdp by 2025 or as much as 75 percent should the economy worsen yaron warned the finance ministry which expects a budget deficit of at least 3 5 percent this year says the situation is being blown out of proportion noting israel is one of the only western countries to have reduced its debt ratio over the past decade there is a gap of 6 billion shekels that we need to close in a budget of 400 billion shekels it s not a big problem and certainly not a catastrophe shai babad the ministry s director general told reuters we are monitoring it when you have 37 8 celsius fever you don t go to surgery by comparison the u s deficit is expected to be 5 percent of gdp in 2019 france s deficit 2 8 percent spain s 2 3 percent britain s 1 7 percent and germany s 1 5 percent according to international monetary fund estimates put brakes on the next israeli government is likely to be in place by late may leader capital markets chief economist jonathan katz said the new administration could implement so called fiscal consolidation measures in two stages in the middle of this year and then in early 2020 i don t think they will necessarily have to cut immediately the budget by 12 billion shekels and raise taxes to put the brakes on right away and sharply i think they have the leeway to do it in two stages he said the budget should have been balanced by 2017 when you are at full employment and this would allow you fiscal tools to expand spending during a slowdown finance ministry chief babad said updated forecasts for state income and expenses would be available in june when the ministry would determine if action was needed the 2020 state budget is expected to be ready for a cabinet vote by early august he added he said if there was an issue with israel s fiscal policies global rating agencies would be more concerned last week fitch affirmed its sovereign debt rating of a with a stable outlook but believes the new government must take steps to narrow the budget deficit similarly standard poor s last year raised its rating to aa from a also with a stable outlook it affirmed the rating in february if the fiscal slippage or relaxation of fiscal performance were to be repeated or happen consistently we might conclude that there is a shift in the government s fiscal

in its second bi monthly meeting held on march 25 and 26 this year the monetary policy committee of the central bank of nigeria delivered a pleasant surprise in the form of a minor cut to the monetary policy rate from 14 per cent to 13 5 per cent it was the first time the mpr would be tinkered with since july 2016 the mpc points to the relative stability in the key macroeconomic variables as well as the need to signal a new direction that is pro growth as justification for the 50 basis point reduction specifically the committee was emboldened by the continued moderation in inflationary pressure and the stability in the foreign exchange market although still in breach of the cbn s upper band target of 9 per cent headline inflation slowed to 11 31 percent in february 2019 from a peak of 18 72 in january 2017 according to the national bureau of statistics on the external front the mpc equally found solace in the moderate improvement in crude oil prices and stable accretion to external reserves especially against the backdrop of current developments in the oil futures market which indicate that oil prices will remain considerably above the federal government s 2019 budget benchmark equally heartwarming for the monetary authority is the trend of declining long term yields in the united states of america in the wake of the federal reserve s shift to a more dovish stance and the likelihood that capital flows in the medium term may be redirected to frontier and emerging markets including nigeria without any doubt this move by the mpc bodes well for the nigerian economy which requires a great deal of real sector traction to achieve full recovery and inclusive growth typically as the mpr which is the rate at which banks borrow money from the cbn is reduced the banks in turn are expected to pass on the benefits to customers by reducing interest rates on loans admittedly a 50 basis point reduction may not be significant to translate to lower lending rates in the near term explaining in part why financial markets reaction to the surprise rate cut seemed subdued the equities market for instance closed in the red with the all share index shedding 0 67 per cent on wednesday being the first trading day following the announcement of the rate cut and only managed to eke out a gain of 0 01 per cent at the close of trading the following day nevertheless the mpc decision has opened the door which seemed shut for about 33 months to subsequent rate cuts in the medium term going forward against the backdrop of benign inflation an accommodative monetary policy will provide room for increased channeling of credit to the real sector thereby reducing the cost of funds for many small and medium enterprises the capital market stands to benefit from a low interest rate environment given that some of the increased liquidity will likely flow into the equities market it will also be positive for the government s fiscal position arising from cheaper bonds issuance considering that part of this year s budget deficit will be financed through borrowing from the domestic capital market it goes without saying that a dovish monetary policy stance is only enabled by low inflation and on this score the fiscal authorities equally have a role to play this is consistent with the fiscal theory of price level ftpl which postulates that the price level is primarily determined by government debt and fiscal policy with monetary policy playing an indirect role contrary to the monetarist view that considers money supply as the primary determinant of inflation the monthly consumer price index reports by the nbs which identify structural factors as the primary drivers of inflation in nigeria would appear to lend credence to this theory this fact is also acknowledged by the mpc which had noted in its latest communiqué that the upside risks to inflation are chiefly due to factors outside the ambit of monetary policy some of these factors highlighted by the committee include the high cost of energy infrastructure constraints insecurity in some parts of the country and anticipated increase in liquidity from the late implementation of the 2018 budget hence it is vital not to downplay the influence of fiscal policy on price level and within the framework of the ftpl harp on the need for greater fiscal monetary co ordination in order to tackle inflation and foster inclusive growth it is for this reason that the federal government is called upon to sustain its current effort aimed at stimulating output growth by executing the policies contained in the economic recovery and growth plan including through addressing the problem of weak power infrastructure as well as tackling the menace of smuggling and dumping of goods into the country in a bid to accelerate domestic production and create employment opportunities as noted by the mpc part of the complementary measures expected of the government also include the speedy passage of the other aspects of the petroleum industry bill to fast track the development of the value chain in the sector as well as the implementation of the new national minimum wage nonetheless it must be pointed out that if a new minimum wage can only be implemented by increasing taxes such as the value added tax then it simply amounts to digging a hole to fill a new one as the associated spike in the cost of goods and services will erode the purchasing power of any upward adjustment to the wage floor therefore any increase in vat can be productive only if it is part of a broad fiscal strategy of rebalancing the tax mix in favour of consumption tax which will entail also lowering the company income tax doing otherwise in an economy that is still grappling with double digit inflation weak growth and high unemployment rate will cause more distortions and jeopardize on going efforts at restoring sustainable economic growth the cbn projects gdp growth rate of 2 74 per cent for nigeria in 2019 higher than the 2 0 per cent and 2 2 per cent recent projections by the imf and the world bank respectively given that the economy expanded by 1 9 per cent in 2018 the cbn s optimistic projection can only materialize following the effective implementation of the capital component of the budget with emphasis on the employment elastic sectors of the economy regrettably implementation of annual budgets particularly the capital aspect has over the years been challenged by absence of timely passage as well as lack of matching funds while recurrent as well as statutory obligations like loan repayments always get fully implemented to this end no stone should be left unturned in getting the fiscal plan ready for implementation as the quick passage of the 2019 budget would reduce uncertainties in the business environment and boost investors confidence in particular the cooperation of the national assembly is required regarding the speedy approval of any government borrowing programme linked to funding the capital component of the budget further the finance ministry should ensure that funds are released on time and together with the ministry of budget and national planning put in place appropriate mechanisms for budget monitoring and evaluation as the mpc rightly noted the government can also help reduce the non performing loans portfolio of the banking industry and stabilise the banking system by expediting action in settling all outstanding contractor related arrears now that the apex bank appears to have signalled its readiness to change the monetary policy stance from tightening to calibrated easing in support of output growth and employment generation it behoves the fiscal authorities to extend the much desired handshake through well targeted complementary measures uwaleke is professor of finance capital market and head banking and finance department nasarawa state university keffi

the one silver lining in the nomination of political hack stephen moore to the federal reserve is that it might spur a productive discussion on the benefits or lack of them of monetary policy as an instrument of economic growth this is principally because it s just one ingredient for what is necessary to instill economic growth and not a particularly good one at that a more direct approach is via appropriately targeted and sufficiently large fiscal actions in regard to monetary policy low interest rates kept in place for a long time can actually constrain economic growth unless they are coupled with sensible compensating fiscal policy due to the adverse income impact to savers emanating from a resultant lower income stream there is also a problem of political legitimacy when so little of the funding is explicitly approved by congress and is left instead to the discretion creation of the federal reserve which has historically tended to prioritize the narrow interests of finance over the rest of the economy and stephen moore a leading advocate of cutting rates to promote additional economic growth even as he has historically championed spending cuts will simply perpetuate the unfortunately widely held notion of monetary policy as an effective cure all if his ideas gain policy traction within the powell led federal reserve in fact what is truly required is well formulated fiscal policy and less monetary policy activism precisely the opposite of today s prevailing trends solvency per se is not the issue the key here is how the money is spent lest fiscal policy become as diffuse in its effects as monetary policy has become as well as discredited politically because of perceived ineffectiveness when long standing structural issues such as inequality remain unaddressed moore a heritage foundation fellow and former wall street journal editorial board member has called for the federal reserve to cut rates in order to spur faltering economic growth here s the problem interest rates are a diffuse tool to manage economic growth for every distressed borrower who benefits from lower interest rate charges there is a saver adversely affected by the resultant loss of income additionally as bloomberg columnist noah smith argues cheap credit does a poor job of weeding out zombie companies that compete for scarce resources in fact a case can be made that low rates actually exacerbate prevailing deflationary trends low rates lower investment threshold returns and reduce the costs of holding inventory both of which can create oversupply as well as perpetuating asset bubbles a highly toxic combination that prevails in the united states indeed globally today even with lower unemployment the u s economy is largely characterized by middling growth spread too thin and too inequitably moore s policy prescriptions would likely make things worse low interest rate regimes have also helped to promote reckless financial engineering that has enabled corporate ceos and their trusty investment bankers to inflate profits and sustain company share prices as high as possible often at a cost of ignoring the strategic long term planning required to handle global competitive challenges from overseas companies that are slowly eating our proverbial lunch in essence therefore lax monetary policy has become the handmaiden of the speculation economy in general the fed s obsession with interest rates and bond yields along with the corresponding shape of the yield curve has obscured the manner in which such rates have provided a low cost laboratory for the creation of frankenstein like instruments of financial mass destruction furthermore as professors l randall wray and scott fullwiler have argued this was made even worse by the fed s cultivation of a belief that no matter what goes wrong the fed would never allow a too big to fail institution to suffer from excessively risky practice if anything this encouraged more risk taking the real paradox of using monetary policy in general is that it only works to the extent that it induces the private sector to spend more out of current income or encourages binging on private debt which low rates can facilitate if current income is adversely impacted by weak income flows however the interest rate is a highly flawed tool to solve the underlying problem especially if it means simplistically cutting rates further as moore advocates such an action can foment bubbles in a multitude of assets stocks and real estate being two of the most prominent examples the collapse of which ultimately creates greater deflation as well as exacerbating income inequality this is because asset bubbles create huge increases in income for top earners particularly in the finance sector due to the relentless expansion of credit brought about by prevailing low rates changes in technology and increasingly poor and outdated regulation in the context of a rapidly globalized financial system have accelerated a trend of asset growth and accumulation increasingly being funneled into fewer and fewer hands at the top when asset bubbles burst the economically distressed sell to those with higher prevailing cash balances setting the stage for further increases in inequality during the subsequent cycle as the post 2008 environment clearly has done as a new economics foundation report argues the process is self reinforcing because increasing wealth accrues both higher income returns and greater political power this means that those with the highest amount of wealth have the means to lobby governments to maintain status quo policy structures that perpetuate inequality cutting rates at this juncture simply perpetuates current bubble like conditions and therefore will make the ultimate outcome worse when the bubble inevitably bursts moore s policy prescription of cutting rates is therefore akin to giving a junkie another shot of heroin rather than dealing with the underlying addiction itself moreover the single minded focus on interest rate levels has per fullwiler and wray diverted the federal reserve s attention away from its responsibility to regulate and supervise the financial sector and its mandate to keep unemployment low its shift of priorities contributed to the creation of those conditions that led to crisis by contrast fiscal policy can also deal more effectively with the pathology of inequality via targeted spending which can impact distributional outcomes as it means directing funds toward those with the highest spending propensities as opposed to the 1 percent who generally save more of their income which means less bang for the fiscal buck contrary to prevailing neoliberal theology economic redistribution in such circumstances actually enhances an economy s growth potential rather than hindering it but we also want to avoid the fiscal zombie mindset as well the key is ensuring that deficits are used toward productive job creation not a perpetuation of crony capitalism all too often fiscal policy has been used in service of the latter this means it has become somewhat politically discredited as an instrument of policy by both parties in the first instance back in 2009 because the initial fiscal rescue package was insufficiently robust given the loss of almost 2 trillion in economic output in the united states alone then president obama s 700bn stimulus package while helpful mostly kept the recession from being far worse rather than enabling a significant economic recovery which later led to republican charges that the policy was ineffective by contrast on the monetary policy front financial institutions received commitments from the federal reserve that may have been as high as 29 trillion according to a report from the levy institute more recently the benefits of trump s highly touted tax reform have proven to be more apparent than real the whole premise behind the lower corporate tax rate was that it would result in literally trillions of dollars allegedly parked offshore being repatriated back to the united states resulting in a surge of job creation however as financial writer alex kimani has illustrated corporate america brought back just 664 9 billion of offshore profits or just 16 6 percent of the 4 trillion trump said they would return as a result of the tax overhaul in reality even kimani s analysis overstates the case there has been no massive dollar repatriation as such these dollars have always remained deposited in u s bank accounts but have simply been classified as offshore via accounting legerdemain in order to exploit lower corporate rates abroad as yves smith of naked capitalism points out apple managed to get a special deal with ireland that allowed it to report corporate profits nowhere for tax purposes kept the cash related to its irish sub in banks in the us and managed it out of an internal hedge fund in arizona given the prevailing deficit phobia that afflicts both political parties depending on which is in power this kind of gimmickry with minimal benefits being experienced by the bulk of the population has legitimized a political narrative against additional fiscal spending on the grounds that it didn t do what it promised to do and placed the united states closer to national bankruptcy while it is true that government that creates and issues its own currency can never run out of money a policy that ignores how funds are spent can easily produce undesirable outcomes such as inflation or rising inequality one of the great post keynesian economists of the 20th century hyman minsky insisted in the words of one of his students l randall wray that the impact of the budget on the economy depends on where spending and taxing is directed military spending and transfers for example are less productive and therefore more inflationary and yet this is precisely where much of trump s new spending is being directed even as vital social spending is being cut back unfortunately this has led opposition to trump to fall into the intellectual cul de sac of obsessing about debts and deficits rather than focusing on what we do with those deficits and as the paltry benefits of last year s tax package have largely dissipated to the extent that they created any economic benefit at all for the bulk of americans the focus has come back to the federal reserve just as stephen moore s nomination has been announced a decade on from the collapse of the 2008 bubble the latest data on inflation shows an invidious combination consumer price index figures are now rising at their lowest level in almost two years but virtually all core inflation reports rana foroohar from the financial times was in rent or the owner s equivalent of rent up 0 3 per cent core goods inflation meanwhile was down 0 2 per cent this means higher house prices at a time when quality affordable housing is still out of reach for the average american lowering interest rates as moore suggests will likely exacerbate the housing bubble and fuel additional stock market speculation without fundamentally doing much to promote further spending power on the part of the average american citizen meanwhile the relative absence of a proper role for fiscal policy means that the toxic prevailing macroeconomic imbalances such as ongoing huge levels of household indebtedness and wealth inequality will continue every tool and target deployed by the federal reserve has simply restored an unhealthy status quo ante in financial speculation while the comparative diminution of fiscal policy has left us with an inefficient economy that still leaves tens of millions of workers behind in terms of wage gains access to decent public infrastructure and denial of quality health care imagine if some of those trillions of government loan guarantees standing credit facilities and bailouts to various financial institutions had gone toward more productive uses how much better would the u s economy look today regrets aside it s becoming increasingly difficult to make the case that cutting interest rates alone is a panacea in fact in the current context it may well make things worse

on www sedar com and on the australian securities exchange simultaneously with this announcement gediktepe overview the gediktepe project is located in the balıkesir province about 370 km west of ankara and 190 km to the south of istanbul gediktepe is owned through the polimetal joint venture on a 50 50 basis with our joint venture partner lidya mining gediktepe is a polymetallic orebody containing economic values for gold silver copper and zinc the sulfide deposit is overlain with oxide ore containing gold and silver which is amenable to leaching gediktepe will be an open pit mine with oxide ore processed first providing cash flow for the development of the sulfide plant for subsequent processing of the more prevalent sulfide ore the oxide and sulfide ore processing circuits share some plant unit operations with some additional grinding capacity and the sulfide float plant commissioned after the initial two year oxide processing campaign the sulfide ore contains gold silver copper and zinc and will be processed through a multi stage flotation circuit producing three marketable concentrates polimetal madencilik sanayi ve ticaret a ş polimetal was formed in 2011 as a joint venture company between lidya madencilik san ve tic a ş lidya mining and alacer gold corp alacer gediktepe mining licenses are held by polimetal the gediktepe project studies are being managed by polimetal the property consists of one operating license rn 85535 on which the entire gediktepe deposit is located and one additional operating license 200700250 that has not yet been fully explored the gediktepe deposit was discovered in april 2013 with the second drill hole drd 002 intersecting 26 5 m at 7 9 g t gold and 77 g t silver from surface drilling for resource definition continued through february 2018 a total of five drilling phases by both diamond core and reverse circulation drilling were completed by local contractor companies the majority of holes have been drilled vertically to intersect the low angle zones of mineralization in 2017 polimetal assembled a study team made up of polimetal personnel and independent consultants to carry out further feasibility assessment of the project the previous technical report was the gediktepe 2016 prefeasibility study pfs16 geology and mineralization the gediktepe regional geology comprises upper paleozoic metamorphics and lower to middle miocene intrusives and volcanics the metamorphics are generally composed of gneiss schists phyllite amphibolite marble and quartzite with varying degrees of metamorphism massive sulfide type mineralization occurs as lens shaped units trending northeast southwest and dipping approximately 20 to 40 to the northwest minerals include pyrite sphalerite tetrahedrite tenantite chalcopyrite galena and magnetite the units are cut by later northwest southeast trending post mineralization structures causing dislocation of the various units post mineralization weathering processes have caused remobilization of the mineralization particularly evident within the oxide zone in which the sulfide mineralization has been completely leached out leaving gold and silver relatively intact the characteristics of the gediktepe mineralization have been interpreted as a convex massive sulfide type deposit with sulfide mineralization deposited about the same time and from the same process as the host rock subsequent weathering and oxidation have been responsible for the development of oxide and gossan horizons production and cost summary gediktepe will be an open pit mine and is close to existing infrastructure and connected to the national power grid production at gediktepe will start with the processing of oxide ore using a single stage semi autogenous grinding mill circuit followed by a carbon in pulp cip gold circuit average lom recoveries for the oxide ore is 90 2 for gold and 70 7 for silver production will transition from oxide processing to sulfide processing during the third year of production the oxide processing plant will be expanded to process the polymetallic sulfide ore by flotation a 5 5 mw secondary grinding ball mill will be added to the grinding circuit sequential flotation will be employed to produce separate copper and zinc concentrates for export the major unit operations of the oxide and sulfide process flowsheets have been tested at bench scale along with specialist vendor test work as required the proposed oxide and sulfide ore flowsheets are presented in figures 2 and 3 metallurgical tests for the sulfide flotation of gediktepe ores yielded recoveries in copper concentrate of 68 for copper and recoveries in zinc concentrate of 77 for zinc and overall recoveries 31 for gold and 24 for

this work was completed at feasibility study fs level with limited work remaining to bring the entire study to fs level however work required for metallurgical testing and recovery performance will require additional drilling to obtain material it is estimated the remaining test work will take at least 18 months to complete which reflects the time needed to access the site permits and weather drilling sampling metallurgical testing and analysis key developments since the pfs16 study include diligent work was undertaken by polimetal in documenting interrogating interpreting and modelling the gediktepe deposit confidence was gained through the predominant use of diamond core drilling and development of important relationships between mineralization types and grade characteristics the estimated mineral resource tonnage grades and contained metal were adjusted based on these advancements the resource classification categories measured indicated inferred denote different levels of confidence or uncertainty within the deposit lower confidence in mineralized continuity at a local resolution may impact short term forecasting due to ore variability to account for these local uncertainties modifications to the mineral resource model classification were made the study included logging core from geotechnical drill holes and obtaining orientation measurements where possible laboratory testing on samples of core is currently being performed some of the geotechnical studies are pending hence preliminary pit slope design recommendations are based on the data collected to date based on site geotechnical investigations pit slope angles range from 25 to 47 inter ramp slopes the pfs16 proposed waste dump site was relocated to the west of the mine to be placed in an area with better foundation conditions the prefeasibility study flowsheet for treatment of the oxide material has been refined from a three stage crush heap leach flowsheet to a single stage crush grind and tank leach flowsheet during metallurgical testing the enriched ore was found to float vigorously and with poor separation of metals which causes concentrate cross contamination this is problematic where it is the predominant mineralization and further test work is aimed at resolving the issue alternative approaches to realizing value from the enriched material were completed by blending various amounts of enriched material with sample composites containing massive pyrite and disseminated material types results show up to 10 and possibly 20 of the enriched material could be blended into the plant feed without overly compromising the copper concentrate quality overall operating cost estimates were adjusted within the pfs19 to calculate annual cash flows over the lom capital and operating cost estimates include the operation of an open pit mine construction and operation of both an oxide and sulfide processing plant next steps the pfs recommends that the assessment of the gediktepe project be continued to a feasibility study level to increase the confidence of the estimates areas within the gediktepe project that require more study work include additional drilling to secure fresh core samples for metallurgical testing additional drilling to increase confidence in the oxide and sulfide ore during project payback years a short range variability study to better understand grade distributions of the economic metals detailed mine grade control plan this may consider varying techniques for blasthole sampling rc drill hole sampling trenching grab samples or guidance using a handheld x ray fluorescence analyzer further work on strategies to mitigate potential acid generation and subsequent metal leaching of mine overburden once metallurgical test work is analyzed and interpreted the open pit and waste dump designs will be refined based on new process parameters the mine waste management plan will also be refined as part of this work about alacer alacer is a

terms associated with various categories of mineral resource or mineral reserve are recognized and required by canadian regulations they may not have equivalent meanings in other jurisdictions outside canada and no comparison should be made or inferred the ni 43 101 term mineral reserve has been used throughout this news release and it has the same meaning as the term ore reserve as defined in the 2012 edition of the australasian code for reporting of exploration results actual recoveries of mineral products may differ from those estimated in the mineral resources and mineral reserves due to inherent uncertainties in acceptable estimating techniques in particular inferred mineral resources have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence economic and legal feasibility it is

an update of the mineral resources for the gediktepe project was completed by amc consultants amc perth australia mid 2018 based on available diamond core and reverse circulation drilling data geological mineralization structural and weathering interpretations by polimetal and supplementary mineralization constraining interpretations prepared by amc estimation methodology the gediktepe resource estimate update specified the following grade fields for estimation au ag zn cu as hg pb fe c and s grades along with bulk densities were estimated into the mineralization domains and background material in the cell model using either ordinary kriging ok or inverse distance weighting to the power of two id2 depending on the domain being estimated composites of either 1 m or 2 m lengths were used grade estimation was conducted into parent cells under hard bounded domain control model verification global and zonal statistics were generated to confirm that estimated model grades values fall within acceptable limits the grade and density estimates in the cell model were checked visually on screen model and drill hole data were overlain and viewed in various sectional and plan views and in 3d with color legends highlighting grade or zonal attributes the model development and grade estimation procedures were subject to a peer review process mineral resources

reserves except for mining losses and grade dilution which are determined through re blocking of the resource model after declaration of the mineral resource ore reserves material assumptions for ore reserves the ore reserves were estimated as part of a pfs with all material assumptions being documented in this release and in the jorc code table 1 contained in appendix 2 of this announcement all operating and capital costs as well as revenue streams were included in the pfs financial model the pfs finds that the recovery of metals is technically and financially feasible generating positive returns on plant and infrastructure investments ore reserves classification ore reserves are estimated on the basis of detailed design and scheduling of the gediktepe open pit the pit boundaries were

varied by revenue factors ranging from 0 4 to 1 4 in order to find the preferred pit size and geometry to use as a basis for detailed design all the ore reserves are derived from measured and indicated mineral resources all inferred mineral resources are considered as waste reported ore reserves incorporate and include mining losses and grade dilution that are not reported in the mineral resource mining method the gediktepe deposit will be mined by conventional open pit hard rock mining methods polimetal currently plans to utilize a contract mining company to move the ore and waste from the mine please see table 1 in the press release ore processing oxide ore is processed via tank leaching and sulfide ore is processed via floatation circuit to generate marketable copper and zinc concentrates cut off grade the pfs19 ore reserve is reported using cut offs based on calculations of nsr this method is considered to be appropriate for polymetallic deposits such as gediktepe separate nsr cut offs are applied to each of the oxide and sulfide zones cut offs applied to the ore reserves were oxide ore 20 67 t and sulfide ore 17 74 t estimation methodology the pfs19 estimate allowed for ore loss and mining dilution using a resource re blocking process to simulate expected mine selectivity due to its polymetallic nature the oxide and sulfide portions of the ore reserve are quoted at an nsr cut off based on metal prices metal recoveries plus on and off site processing costs the metal prices used in the economic analysis to demonstrate the ore reserve are 1 315 oz au 18

produce gold silver copper and zinc to be sold as either copper or zinc concentrate the metallurgical testing to date indicates that the gold silver doré and both concentrates will be of marketable quality the project will require the development of infrastructure items in order to operate the current approach to the project is tank leaching of oxides in the first two years followed by sulfide flotation in the succeeding nine years after modification of the oxide plant a tailings storage facility will accommodate both oxide and sulfide process tailings most of the project area falls into forest land and will need forestry permits from the general directorate of forestry and prime ministry the project as shown in the pfs will require a total 370 4 hectares of forest permit area over the life of the mining operation additional permits will be needed which include but not limited to environmental impact assessment eia in progress forest permits underground water usage permit and waste storage permit appendix 2 jorc code table 1 the following tables are provided to ensure compliance with the jorc code 2012 edition requirements for the reporting of exploration results and

by egon von greyerz one of the fed s three main objectives is to maintain stable prices but they have never achieved that at least not since 1971 again the fed did a volte face because they have a total inability to read the economy the clueless fed overslept and realised a few years too late that the us economy was overheating so at the time when the economy was turning down the fed started to increase rates and implement qt quantitative tightening but now they are panicking and reversing policy again i discussed the incompetence of the fed last week below is the fed s incompetence chart some people would use a sophisticated description like an inverted yield curve when the rate goes negative but that doesn t tell the real story the chart shows the 10 year us treasury minus the fed funds rate this spread has just gone negative which means that 10 year rates are lower than short term rates this is interpreted as a high probability that a recession is imminent looking at the chart since the late 1980s it went negative in 1989 before the early 1990s recession again in 1998 and 2000 before the economic downturn and the 80 crash of the nasdaq again it went negative in 2006 just before the great financial crisis so long rates being lower than short rates is clearly a good indication of an economic downturn and a stock market crash inverted yield curve reveals fed s incompetence what an inverted yield curve really tells us is the inability of the fed to forecast market turns the fed sets short term rates but they are always behind the curve since their model can never predict anything accurately so instead of the fed anticipating a downturn in the economy the market will do it for them the 10 year rate is set by the market which clearly senses the impending recession and thus buys the bonds and forces the long term rate down below the short term rate so the market knows before the fed that trouble is coming this proves that the fed s and other central banks manipulation of rates creates a false market which seriously distorts economic cycles if short term rates were determined by the market the chance of an inverted yield curve would be extremely small as short term rates would fall faster than long term rates when demand for money declines central banks manipulation not only creates false markets but also extreme economic peaks and troughs if the natural laws of supply and demand ruled the world economy would fare a lot better dollar has lost 98 5 due to fed s failure to achieve objectives the reason why central banks dislike gold is that it reveals their total failure to achieve the objective of price and currency stability since the fed was created in 1913 the dollar has lost 98 5 in real terms which is gold and in this century the dollar has lost 79 there is really no need for central banks since their policies are always detrimental to the domestic and global economies if we look at two other central banks we will find that they also have totally failed in achieving their objectives we ensure that money retains its value this statement appears on the website of the world s oldest central bank you wonder how the bank could have the audacity to make such a statement in this century alone the country s currency has lost 80 in value and since 1971 the currency lost 99 obviously the fall in the currency is measured against gold which is the only money that has survived intact in history i am talking about sweden s central bank the riksbank which was created 351 years ago in 1668 this central bank has clearly failed totally to achieve its objectives just like every single central bank in history in the early 1600s silver and gold were in short supply in sweden due to the high cost of prolonged wars sweden then introduced copper coins in 1624 as an alternative to gold and silver also sweden wanted to maintain the price of copper as it was their biggest export one mine the falun mine dates back to 1288 and became stora kopparberg mining company in 1347 this is regarded as the world s oldest industrial company during the 17th century the company produced 2 3rd of europe s copper consumption and also financed sweden s wars in 1644 stora started producing big coins to keep the price of copper high the biggest was 62 cm or 2 foot long and weighed 20kg not really a practical coin to keep in your pocket especially since the value would have been 1 100th of a similar size silver coin sweden s first bank stockholm banco was founded in 1656 the bank issued credit notes or banknotes to replace the cumbersome copper coins sweden thus became the first country in europe to issue bank notes eventually the bank issued too many notes without any tangible backing the holders of the banknotes sensed that there were problems and asked for redemption in metals obviously the bank didn t have anywhere near enough metals to redeem the banknotes thus stockholm banco went bankrupt in 1664 8 years after it was founded as i have said many times the more things change the more they stay the same bank depositors beware the fraud committed by sweden s first bank is happening in virtually every bank in the world today we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us because every bank is accepting depositors money and lending it out 10 to 50 times once the crisis starts the bank will have zero ability to pay the depositors back and all their money will be lost no central bank will bail out the depositors but they will instead bail in depositors money but it won t just be their money that is bailed in but also any other assets that the clients are holding such as stocks bonds and precious metals no one should believe that they will get anything back this is a very similar story to what john law did in france in the early 1700s creating a banking and currency collapse as well as the collapse of the mississippi company in the us this happened as the same time as the south sea bubble in the uk maintain domestic coinage at its right and fair value the swedish riksbank was founded from the ruins of stockholm banco in 1668 already from the beginning swedish law stated that the riksbank was to maintain the domestic coinage at its right and fair value and today 331 years later the riksbank states we ensure that money retains its value so after over 300 year s of history with the same core objective the bank has totally failed since losing over 99 of its value could hardly be called that money retains its value subscribe with negative interest rates since early 2015 how can the swedish krona retain its value gold in swedish kroner reveals it all it is now at an all time high the riksbank s policy is not price stability but currency debasement in order to promote exports this has led to massive inflation in asset prices with a major bubble in property values and also in stocks norway doesn t understand a stable currency they have no gold if we go to norway s central bank norges bank their primary objective is price stability by means of monetary policy and to keep inflation low and stable well anyone who goes to norway will find the country very expensive and also here the property market is a massive bubble norway has no understanding of a stable currency and how can they since they no longer have any gold reserves well they actually hold 7 gold bars they sold the last 37 tonnes back in 2004 no wonder gold in norwegian kroner is at a record high against gold the norwegian krone has lost 80 since 2000 and 98 since 1971 is that what is called price stability when a currency has lost 80 in the last 18 years the readers of my writings all know what this means it means that the norwegian krone together with most currencies will lose at least 99 from here in the next few years but virtually no one in norway buys gold they follow the lead of their central bank and have zero investment in gold imagine the wealth destruction that the norwegians will experience in coming years they can just check with argentina or venezuela to see what will happen but they won t of course gold maginot line guaranteed to break gold in both swedish and norwegian kroner is above the 2011 peak this is a very clear indication that gold will break the maginot line at around 1 350 when so many other currencies are above the 2011 highs the maginot line is guaranteed to break in the near term future money printing will not work next time central banks around the world have created the biggest bubble in history when this bubble bursts in the next few years they will have no tools to save the world they will try the only thing they know which is unlimited money printing and lowering rates but they will be surprised to find that this time it will have no effect and why should it since you can t solve a debt problem with more worthless debt clearly the fed and other central banks are aware of this this is why we could see an attempt by the fed to substantially devalue the dollar by say 90 and back it or tie it to gold and maybe also oil that would give gold a value of around 14 000 they could do this combined with special drawing rights or a new cryptodollar they will thus try to make the market believe that the new currency is the solution to the us debt problem but the effect of such a soft reset would be short lived firstly china and russia wouldn t accept it and they would also require the us to prove that they actually hold 8 000 tonnes of physical gold since they most probably don t have more than a fraction of that gold in physical form there will be panic in financial markets the new cryptodollar would crash leading to hyperinflation gold and silver would surge creating panic in the precious metals market as it would be impossible to get hold of physical stock at virtually any price eventually we will see the start of the greatest financial crisis in history as i have outlined many times a currency crash and debt collapse is absolutely guaranteed it is only a question of when
economic reform in china current progress and future prospects last december marked the 40th anniversary of china s reform and opening up policy which was launched under the leadership of deng xiaoping at the 1978 third plenum this policy jump started china s transformation from a poor and underdeveloped centrally planned economy into an economic powerhouse increasingly driven by the market the anniversary however was overshadowed by the current challenges in the chinese economy and uncertainty over the direction of economic reforms in 2018 china s economy grew at the slowest rate since 1990 and the country became embroiled in a trade war with the us at the same time the economy has developed to a point where its established growth model is no longer tenable at this crossroad in china s economic development we ask which way are reforms heading china s reform and opening up china s reform and opening up policies introduced private business and market incentives to what was a state led communist system prior to 1978 the private sector was virtually non existent today private firms contribute to approximately 70 percent of china s gdp to get to this point china underwent vast changes to its economic system over the past 40 years despite the breadth of the changes however china s economic reforms have been characterized by gradualism and experimentalism or crossing the river by feeling the stones as deng famously once said special economic zones sezs typified this gradualism and experimentalism where the government piloted new reforms in geographically contained areas no region in china better encapsulates the success of this strategy than shenzhen which was at the forefront of reform and opening up initiatives and exploded from a tiny fishing village into one of the country s wealthiest and most dynamic cities nevertheless although the market was given a more important role in resource allocation as a result of reforms the state still maintains a strong role 40 years later in this respect china s development and reform path is unique with it sometimes being referred to as the china model of development to this day it is debated whether china developed because of the continued role of the state in its economy or despite it this debate is an important one because it informs the future direction of reforms what is clearer is that the reform and opening up policies are regarded overall as a success over the 40 year period 740 million people have escaped poverty and the country posted a prolonged period of double digit economic growth china is now the second largest economy in the world behind the us and is figures among the world bank s middle income countries mics based upon gni per capita challenges and further reforms despite the successes of the chinese economy in recent years it has shown vulnerabilities and entered a critical stage for its continued development and reform economic growth has slowed from the previous double digit rates with this being described as the new normal as the country s economy becomes more mature in 2018 china s gdp grew by 6 6 percent according to official statistics and the leadership in beijing has lowered the growth target to 6 6 5 percent for 2019 many economists argue that actual growth is significantly lower than these official figures economists from both inside and outside of china have called for the country s leaders to adopt structural reforms so that it can continue to develop and avoid the dreaded middle income trap the middle income trap refers to when an economy becomes developed enough that it loses its low cost advantages but is not developed enough to transition to a higher value knowledge based economy thereby slumping to middling performance while almost all analysts agree that china must adopt wide ranging economic reforms to sustain its economy in the long run there is a split regarding what exactly those reforms should entail liberal economists argue that china should adopt more market based measures such as by reducing the role of state owned enterprises and market distorting support in the economy others with a more statist view argue that china should increase subsidies to strategic industries and protect domestic firms to promote their development at the 2013 third plenum 35 years after the launch of deng s reforms the communist party under the leadership of president xi jinping made a decisive commitment to further reforms at the plenum a 60 point plan entitled the decision on major issues concerning comprehensively deepening reforms was released one of the key decisions pledged to allow the market to play a decisive role in resource allocation which appeared to signal a preference for market based measures a greater role for the market since 2013 since the 2013 third plenum the market has been given a more decisive role in some areas for instance foreign direct investment fdi restrictions have been eased due to china moving from an approval based system to a negative list based system this new system allows most inbound fdi to proceed without a government review except in those areas that are on the negative list over time the scope of this negative list has also been reduced fdi is important to china s development because it plays a key role in driving higher value added industrial output for example in 2016 foreign funded businesses accounted for 77 percent of china s total high tech exports restrictions on fdi have been eased even further for firms investing in free trade zones ftzs ftzs were first launched in 2013 and continue in the spirit of deng s gradualism and experimentalism by allowing reform policies to be tested before some of them are rolled out on a national scale trade facilitation reforms which china prioritized by ratifying the wto trade facilitation agreement in 2015 were implemented in such a way these reforms have led to the implementation of a single window system nationwide to simplify trade inspections declarations taxes and other procedures it partly explains why china moved from 78th in 2017 to 48th in 2018 in the world bank s ease of doing business rankings further to the above there are signs that beijing is willing to implement tough yet necessary reforms to sustain china s economy in the long run for example the government has shown restraint with its monetary policy which has reduced financial risks through deleveraging this difficult decision is one of the reasons why china s economy is slowing down but beijing seems willing to accept this as long as the economy does not experience a hard landing to ensure that a hard landing does not happen beijing has been more active with implementing fiscal policy in place of wide ranging stimulus measures at the annual two sessions meetings in march for example premier li keqiang announced us 298 billion in tax cuts for businesses the state reasserting control since 2013 even though there has been progress in some areas since 2013 in other areas it appears the state is trying to reassert control at the expense of the market there are therefore questions surrounding beijing s commitment to market based reforms there is even speculation that beijing is content with the current mix between the state and market and rather than focus on further reforms it is more focused on exporting the china model through policies such as the belt and road initiative bri the winter 2019 edition of the china dashboard which tracks the reform goals decided at the 2013 third plenum shows reforms are not moving forward in eight out of 10 areas one of the areas where reforms are backsliding is state owned enterprise soe reform with the role of soes in resource allocation advancing while the role of the private sector is receding one of the reasons for this is that soes enjoy more preferential access to credit than the private sector although the government s deleveraging campaign has reduced financial risks it has hit the private sector harder than the state sector this is despite the private sector being three times more efficient on average than the state sector and contributing close to two thirds of china s gdp growth in terms of fdi even with the easing of restrictions with the introduction of the new negative list there are claims that there is still an unlevel playing field with domestic firms being given preference over foreign firms this is exemplified by the made in china 2025 industrial strategy which is at the center of the trade war with the us made in china 2025 is an industrial policy issued in 2015 that targets 10 high tech sectors under the guidance of the chinese state among other claims the us argues that the strategy favors domestic firms in the allocation of subsidies and forces foreign firms to transfer technology as a condition for market access as a result the us also argues that china is violating its wto commitments and that the country should adopt market based reforms to level the playing field in defense of its development model beijing has even gone as far as calling for wto reforms that respect members development models which would grant china more leeway in implementing statist and protectionist policies however recently there have been signs that beijing is willing to compromise and address washington s concerns for example in march china s national people s congress passed a new foreign investment law this law aims to address common complaints from the foreign business community such as by explicitly banning forced technology transfers critics however say that many of the provisions in this document are still quite general and the law itself will not take effect until january 1 2020 feeling the stones what to make of china s reforms record since 2013 the progress of reforms has been mixed on one hand china has made clear progress in some areas such as improving the business environment and opening some new sectors to foreign investment on the other hand however the state has reasserted itself rather than given the market the decisive role xi for instance has called for soes to become bigger stronger and more efficient while the communist party has increased its presence in both state owned and private firms in recent years given china s mixed record of economic reform since xi came to power it is not yet clear whether the statist turn is a fundamental change in direction or a temporary period of caution and feeling the stones before reforms speed up again what s next in china s reform process and the impact of recent events on china s development will only become clearer with time particularly as the country is pressured by the us to adopt structural market based reforms yet despite external pressure to pursue certain reforms or because of it china is determined to find and pursue its own reform path just as it did in the past as xi said on the 40th anniversary of the reform and opening up no one is in the position to dictate to the chinese people what should and should not be done

entrepreneurial community as a vehicle for accelerating economic growth and dynamism introduction there is growing concern by scholars policymakers and the general public that america is facing a retreat in the level of economic growth and dynamism enjoyed by americans since the beginning of the 20th century the slowdown in economic growth rates has been matched with declining innovation indicators including startup formation rates employment in new firms and the proportion of people moving across state lines though these trends have been in motion for the last three decades there is evidence that the recession a recession is a significant and sustained decline in the economy typically a recession lasts longer than six months but recovery from a recession can take a few years s in 2001 and 2007 to 2009 accelerated them a key element of america s dynamism problem is a drop in entrepreneurship fewer people are deciding to become entrepreneurs who are the source of new businesses and generate most net new jobs dynamism s decline is having disparate effects on regions and cities within the united states contributing to economic stratification and political angst the retreat of american economic dynamism may have multifaceted origins and policymakers will have to consider changes in policy ranging from regulation to housing some focus on encouraging a stronger culture of innovation and entrepreneurship while others attend to long run challenges around education and human capital a mix of policies will be necessary to properly address a deep running problem in the

should compete in a competitive market allowing market forces to determine the efficient allocation of resources in the economy a more neutral tax code would increase incentives to work save and invest for all in the economy including entrepreneurs removing tax barriers for entrepreneurs would therefore improve america s dynamism while making america s tax code more neutral efficient and simple for all taxpayers this paper provides an overview of how tax policy effects entrepreneurial activity including how tax rates and the structure of tax policy influence entrepreneurs decisions to take risks it will highlight why policymakers should care about entrepreneurship from the perspective of economic growth outline a conceptual framework to generalize the role taxes play in an entrepreneur s decision making and review the literature examining the relationship between tax policy and entrepreneurship this should help guide policymakers thinking to ensure that tax policy does not stand in the way of a revival in american entrepreneurship entrepreneurship and economic growth given entrepreneurship s salience in public policy debates entrepreneurship must be well defined to understand its unique contribution to economic growth and innovation entrepreneurs are distinct from their peers because of their willingness to take on risk to obtain economic profit through new ways to serve a good or service those new methods may include creating a new business model catering to consumer needs more effectively or providing lower prices than their competitors risk is inseparable from entrepreneurship as any venture to achieve economic profit is fraught with uncertainty israel kirzner in competition and entrepreneurship focuses on the alertness required by entrepreneurs to find a potential source of economic profit which may be missed by others the political economist joseph schumpeter emphasized the destructive and creative consequences of entrepreneurship arguing that carrying out innovations is the only function which is fundamental in history but before understanding how entrepreneurship impacts economic growth it is important to establish how economic growth happens in general neoclassical economics uses a production function commonly referred to as the cobb douglas production function this equation posits that output y is produced by a combination of technology and innovations a labor l and capital k capital and labor s relationship to total output is represented by their elasticities a these elasticities represent the effect of an additional hour worked or an additional unit of capital deployed on total output for example an elasticity a of 7 means that for a 1 percent increase in l total output increases by 0 7 percent traditionally analysis focuses on labor and capital and their respective elasticities the value of a representing technology and innovation is understood to be a residual which cannot be influenced by policy however some economic thinking is changing on this question arguing that technology and innovation can be influenced and grown through sound public policy decisions entrepreneurship and tax policy a conceptual framework the effect of taxation on entrepreneurs and startups can be generalized into a conceptual framework to understand the real world influence of specific tax policy changes taxes influence the risks entrepreneurs take the incomes they earn and their fixed costs taxing entrepreneurs income the income entrepreneurs accrue can be separated into two parts capital income or return to an entrepreneur s capital investment and labor income or sweat equity the latter type of income results from an entrepreneur s effort skill and luck as the entrepreneur is both a business owner and an employee working for the enterprise the income an entrepreneur earns will contain both capital and labor income capital income the capital income that an entrepreneur realizes may contain a normal rate of return to waiting and a super normal return that compensates her for risk taking take for example an entrepreneur who earns 50 000 in income from a venture after two years of work and a capital investment of 10 000 a portion of that income represents a normal return to waiting at 3 5 percent per year the entrepreneur accrues about 10 715 any return to capital above the normal rate of return is a super normal return for engaging in risk contrast this with labor income which is the portion of an entrepreneur s income that comes from putting her effort and skill into the firm a higher effective tax rate on entrepreneurs drives up the required gross return an entrepreneur needs to move forward on an investment the higher gross return covers the additional tax levy keeping the net return the same as before if that gross return is not expected to be met the entrepreneur may reconsider their plans given the opportunity costs entrepreneurs may take several years to scale accruing a higher market value for the firm if the tax code were structured as a pure income tax the entrepreneur would pay income tax on the increase in the firm s market value every year for example consider an entrepreneur who raises her firm s value by 20 percent per year over five years before selling the enterprise if the firm started with a one time investment of 100 000 and was worth 100 000 the firm would be worth 248 830 when sold after subtracting an investment cost of 100 000 the present value after tax return is 101 157 or about 101 percent the tax system permits entrepreneurs to defer capital gains within their firm until they realize those gains upon sale this lowers the tax burden on entrepreneurs and raises their after tax returns in our example tax deferral raises the present value of the entrepreneur s after tax return from 101 157 to 102 780 the deferred tax liability has raised the entrepreneur s net return by over one percentage point an increase in the rate of income tax reduces the total expected rate of return by reducing the return to an entrepreneur s imputed labor income in the case of an entrepreneur facing a 2 percent increase in her effective marginal tax rate the marginal tax rate is the amount of additional tax paid for every additional dollar earned as income the average tax rate is the total tax paid divided by total income earned a 10 percent marginal tax rate means that 10 cents of every next dollar earned would be taken as tax every additional dollar earned by applying more labor into the venture is taxed at that higher rate the entrepreneur s expected return on capital by contrast is not affected by the increased tax rate super normal returns to capital income an entrepreneur seeks to obtain an economic profit by identifying and taking advantage of differences in market prices the result is a super normal return or a return above what one would expect from a risk free return to waiting put another way super normal returns compensate the entrepreneur for engaging in a risky endeavor absent the expectation of a super normal return a prospective entrepreneur would have no economic reason to pursue a risky venture risk is reflected in the expected value of pursuing a given activity for example a 50 percent chance of earning a 10 percent return on investment yields an expected value of 5 percent as risk increases the expected return falls if the expected return is below the expected return of alternative activities the venture will not be undertaken super normal returns are the expected result of entrepreneurial risk taking super normal returns can be generated through economic rents from land or from quasi rents as tax foundation senior fellow stephen j entin describes quasi rents arise in situations of imperfect competition where barriers to entry such as patents regulatory hurdles or other protections of incumbent producers by governments delay production of similar goods and services by other potential suppliers above normal profits may also result from access to scarce or specialized resources a reputation for quality or successful risk taking and innovation that lead to a particularly attractive new design discovering a new oil field or being the first to offer a new product where it takes time for the competition to catch up activities yielding super normal rates of return are considered less sensitive to taxes than investments that yield a normal return consider the economic rents yielded from owning a piece of land in a valuable neighborhood a land owner cannot move the land to another location to avoid the tax and remains better off if she earns economic profit from the land s use the landowner will therefore fully bear a land tax quasi rents yielded from barriers to entry are more sensitive to taxes than economic rents from land but actors are more limited in their behavioral changes than those earning a normal rate of return while land rents and quasi rents from barriers to entry patents or regulatory hurdles may be less sensitive to tax than normal returns the super normal returns to risk are sensitive to tax it is important to consider how taxes affect investment decisions facing prospective entrepreneurs and not only look at retrospective investment the taxation of super normal returns presents a challenge to policymakers as super normal returns can be generated by risk taking entrepreneurs or by other means including returns to luck or imperfect competition incumbents may use barriers to entry regulatory restrictions or patents to increase their profit margins while the latter kind of rent should be targeted as a source of tax revenue taxes on super normal returns may also dissuade risk taking by lowering the expected rate of return on prospective entrepreneurial ventures labor income an increase in an entrepreneur s tax rate reduces her labor incentive on an extensive and an intensive margin an entrepreneur may decide to work fewer hours or apply less effort in the business or could decide that it is not worth it to expend any effort given her expected rate of return to her labor often entrepreneurs sustain losses before realizing a super normal return upon maturing their venture the intervening time may be used to develop and market a new product or business model increase market share and scale the startup to a sustainable firm that can capture the super normal return the firm may also appreciate over time which represents accrued value for the entrepreneur s labor and capital stay informed on the tax policies impacting you subscribe to get insights from our trusted experts delivered straight to your inbox subscribe ideally the tax code would treat entrepreneurs with losses and entrepreneurs who fail equally to entrepreneurs who succeed if profits and losses are treated symmetrically in the tax code then taxes will not alter an entrepreneur s expected return or her decision to engage in risk taking in practice entrepreneurs are limited in when and how much of their net operating losses they can deduct from their future tax liabilities it is important to note the benefits that the tax code provides to entrepreneurs the labor component of an entrepreneur s income is combined with capital income which receives preferential treatment through a lower tax rate when an entrepreneur sells their business this gives entrepreneurs a tax advantage over those who choose to earn labor income in traditional employment arrangements a second advantage an entrepreneur gets from the tax code is the deferral on tax liability for capital income accrued before the firm is sold and the gain is realized a key driver of the influence of taxes on entrepreneurship is how it changes incentives to engage in effort on the margin many entrepreneurs may obtain rates of return above a change in the rate of income tax earning inframarginal returns that are insensitive to the rate change this is not relevant when evaluating the aggregate effect of a tax rate change on entrepreneurship overall as entrepreneurs decide to move forward with ventures at the margin in other words it is the venture that is on the edge between being profitable and making a loss that will be sensitive to a tax rate increase affecting the total amount of entrepreneurship in the economy the effect of taxation on entrepreneurs fixed costs fixed costs imposed by taxation have a different effect on an entrepreneur s expected return than variable costs do fixed costs are expenses that do not change with an increase or decrease in the volume of goods or services sold by a firm examples of fixed costs imposed on entrepreneurs include tax compliance and complexity which must be navigated as a precondition of entry by an entrepreneur the fixed costs created by tax policy influences an entrepreneur s decision to enter or exit not the volume of goods or services to produce take for example an entrepreneur offering a new way to provide legal services to low income families the entrepreneur may have to spend 5 000 to ensure she is tax compliant and successfully navigate complex reporting requirements the 5 000 is considered a fixed cost independent of the amount of legal services she provides to customers the volume of services she provides will be determined by the point where the marginal cost of producing an additional hour of service equals the price she can command for the service independent of the fixed cost imposed by tax complexity this may be true even if the firm is running a loss imagine for example that the firm is making 10 000 per month on legal services but must spend 11 000 to remain tax compliant the fixed costs of tax compliance puts the firm at a loss of 1 000 per month but the entrepreneur would continue to provide legal services if the entrepreneur shut down she would be out 11 000 in tax compliance instead the entrepreneur would operate until the cost of legal services exceeded the price consumers are willing to pay making her unable to cover her variable costs fixed costs created by tax compliance and complexity determine entrepreneur s decision to enter or exit an industry if the costs overwhelm the expected return on investment it also lowers the total return expected from an investment at the beginning on a venture which could deter firm entry if other opportunities would yield a higher return costs imposed on the margin such as marginal income tax rates also play a role in determining if an entrepreneur decides to move forward with a business opportunity tax policy and entrepreneurship tax policy can influence the decisions entrepreneurs make to enter an industry invest and engage in risk taking through two channels the tax rates entrepreneurs face on their income and the structure of the tax code for example how the tax code treats losses and capital investments tax rates and entrepreneurship the economic literature has found that tax rates have a mixed to negative effect on entrepreneurial activity corporate income tax a corporate income tax cit is levied by federal and state governments on business profits many companies are not subject to the cit because they are taxed as pass through businesses with income reportable under the individual income tax rates are associated with lower levels of entrepreneurship one study of 17 european countries between 1997 and 2014 found that corporate income tax rates had significant effects on firm entry rates and that this evidence is consistently robust across a variety of specifications lower corporate income tax rates increase firm entry the authors argue by increasing the return to risk and incentivizing incomes to shift from personal to corporate taxation the authors also find that lower corporate income tax rates spur greater firm entry when there is a better tax compliance infrastructure suggesting that countries will see more benefit from lower corporate income tax rates if they make it more difficult to hide income through profit and loss account manipulation corporate income taxes may also uniquely harm entrants over incumbent firms economists have taken advantage of differences in state tax policy to understand how taxes interact with entrepreneurship economists mark curtis and ryan decker use county level startup data to find that young employer firms are particularly susceptible to tax policy shocks relative to established firms for every percentage point increase in corporate income tax rates employment in startup firms goes down by 3 7 percent state individual income tax an individual income tax or personal income tax is levied on the wages salaries investments or other forms of income an individual or household earns the u s imposes a progressive income tax where rates increase with income the federal income tax was established in 1913 with the ratification of the 16th amendment though barely 100 years old individual income taxes are the largest source of tax revenue in the u s rates and the presence of an estate tax an estate tax is imposed on the net value of an individual s taxable estate after any exclusions or credits at the time of death the tax is paid by the estate itself before assets are distributed to heirs may also reduce a state s share of national entrepreneurship personal income taxes also influence entrepreneurship the reduction in marginal tax rates after the tax reform act of 1986 led to an increase in hiring rates by entrepreneurs a decrease in marginal tax rates by 10 percent was associated with a 12 percent increase in the mean probability of hiring workers the progressivity of individual income taxes reduces an entrepreneur s expected rate of return at higher income levels which effectively operates as a tax on success progressivity has an independent negative effect on firm entry rates as a progressive tax a progressive tax is one where the average tax burden increases with income high income families pay a disproportionate share of the tax burden while low and middle income taxpayers shoulder a relatively small tax burden rate schedule reduces the return to risk at higher payoffs this result is expected as economic theory suggests that entrepreneurs respond to higher marginal tax rates by reducing the labor they expend in response to a lower return some studies find a positive relationship between higher marginal income tax rates and entrepreneurship if personal income tax rates are higher than corporate income tax rates some entrepreneurs with losses may decide to change organizational form ex post to offset other income tax liability this is a net subsidy to risk taking though rules exist to limit how often firms change organizational form and the amount of their tax loss harvesting entrepreneurial innovation and tax policy innovative activity by entrepreneurs is also influenced by tax rates within startups inventors research development labs and engineers engage in innovative activity that requires risk taking many of these innovators are not self employed but instead work within large often incumbent firms risk taking by inventors and innovators working in startups and incumbent firms is changed by personal income tax rates expected incomes play a large role in individual decisions to enter an occupation with a high up front cost to obtain necessary skills or education as top marginal income tax rates rise individuals may decide to avoid working in innovative occupations given the low payoff as stanford economist charles jones puts it high incomes are the prize that motivates entrepreneurs to turn a basic research insight that results from formal into a product or process that ultimately benefits consumers raising top marginal income tax rates from 30 to 60 percent tends to negatively affect innovation by top inventors more than marginal tax rate increases up to 30 percent superstar inventors those who create a disproportional amount of innovation as measured through patents and inventions are sensitive to individual and corporate income taxes using patent data from between 1976 and 2010 economists enrico moretti and daniel wilson find that there are large stable and precisely estimated effects of personal and corporate taxes on star scientist s migration patterns this result confirms results by an earlier study finding similar effects on inventors international mobility from tax rates since 1977 the location and number of superstar inventors may be a chief constraint for innovation levels to remain at or above the levels the developed world has enjoyed historically tax policy is one of many considerations prospective innovators consider when deciding where to locate and whether to enter an innovative occupation inventors are less sensitive to tax rates in areas where there is more agglomeration or an abundance of innovators already living and working closely together this helps explain why cities such as san francisco and new york city maintain their dynamism despite their relatively high overall tax burden when controlling for agglomeration effects taxes influence individual decisions to enter innovative activity the extensive margin and how hard they work on research and hire employees the intensive margin structural effects of the tax code on entrepreneurship in addition to the level and progressivity of tax rates the structure of the tax code also influences the decisions of entrepreneurs to enter an industry invest and innovate the tax treatment business losses and investment are especially important structural elements of the tax code for entrepreneurs entrepreneurs often face losses for a time before becoming profitable and realizing super normal returns on investment this makes the tax treatment of those losses important to entrepreneurs who will not have taxable income taxable income is the amount of income subject to tax after deductions and exemptions for both individuals and corporations taxable income differs from and is less than gross income until they become profitable the tax code treats business profits and losses asymmetrically a business profit incurs an immediate tax liability while a business loss does not always yield an immediate tax benefit an entrepreneur with a net operating loss must carry over the loss to a future tax year due to the time value of money and inflation inflation is when the general price of goods and services increases across the economy reducing the purchasing power of a currency and the value of certain assets the same paycheck covers less goods services and bills it is sometimes referred to as a hidden tax as it leaves taxpayers less well off due to higher costs and bracket creep while increasing the government s spending power these losses are worth less than if they were immediately realized to offset tax liability a partial solution to this problem is to incorporate an inflation adjustment and a real return to capital into the net operating loss to equalize their tax treatment though this would not help businesses that go out of business before reaching profitability financers of entrepreneurial ventures also face a tax asymmetry when they have a capital loss federally the tax code permits up to 3 000 in deductions for capital losses per tax year with any capital losses above 3 000 required to be carried forward to future tax years when they can be deducted against future capital gains this penalizes financing of risky ventures as capital losses realized in the future have less value than those realized in the present finally this discussion should not be considered exhaustive numerous other tax policies influence the entrepreneurial community including issues that impact all businesses these include the tax code s bias against capital investment bias towards debt investment over equity investment and depreciation depreciation is a measurement of the useful life of a business asset such as machinery or a factory to determine the multiyear period over which the cost of that asset can be deducted from taxable income instead of allowing businesses to deduct the cost of investments immediately i e full expensing depreciation requires deductions to be taken over time reducing their value and discouraging investment provisions among others conclusion tax policy can help america reverse its decline in economic dynamism structural barriers in the tax code that put entrepreneurs at a disadvantage should be remedied so that entrepreneurs can make decisions to take risk based on market signals not the tax code the tax code as currently constructed is not entirely a headwind for entrepreneurs on the contrary the tax code confers several advantages to entrepreneurs including the deferral of tax on imputed labor income and a preferential tax rate on capital gains the key for policymakers is to identify places where the code can be improved so that it does not stand in the way of entrepreneurs success stay informed on the tax policies impacting you subscribe to get insights from our trusted experts delivered straight

consider an entrepreneur who after evaluating relevant opportunity costs has found a potential opportunity that yields a post tax return of 18 75 percent in one year if 100 00 is invested she realizes 125 000 in income and deducts the 100 000 in investment cost under a full expensing full expensing allows businesses to immediately deduct the full cost of certain investments in new or improved technology equipment or buildings it alleviates a bias in the tax code and incentivizes companies to invest more which in the long run raises worker productivity boosts wages and creates more jobs regime to determine her taxable income of 25 000 if her effective tax rate is 25 percent she realizes an after tax return of 18 750 or 18 75 percent of the 100 00 investment if the effective tax rate

represent fixed costs in the short run take for example a venture with an expected return of 10 percent after five years in operation if tax compliance costs lower the expected return discounted and

source xinhua 2019 04 03 16 45 17 editor xuxin video player close washington april 2 xinhua managing director of the international monetary fund imf christine lagarde said here tuesday that the imf anticipates a synchronized deceleration of global growth in the years ahead and that resolving trade disputes by imposing import tariffs will invite self inflicted wounds deceleration but no recession addressing the 13th annual capital markets summit held at the u s chamber of commerce headquarters lagarde said ever since the imf in january downgraded its global growth forecasts to around 3 5 percent for 2019 and 2020 the world economy has lost further momentum hinting that the imf will further cut its projections in an updated world economic outlook due to be released on april 9 lagarde said the imf now expects 70 percent of the global economy to experience a slowdown in growth in 2019 whereas just two years ago 75 percent of the global economy experienced synchronized growth acceleration to be clear we do not see a recession in the near term she added in fact we expect some pickup in growth in the second half of 2019 and into 2020 during a panel discussion following her speech lagarde further explained that the synchronized deceleration and a slowing momentum that the imf has predicted will be across the spectrum affecting advanced economies emerging market economies as well as low income countries the expected rebound in global growth later this year and into early 2020 lagarde said is precarious because it is vulnerable to downside risks associated with country related uncertainties those uncertainties according to lagarde include britain s planned exit from the european union and broader uncertainties such as high debt in some sectors and some countries tensions around trade policy as well as a sense of unease in financial markets so indeed it is a delicate moment in and of itself lagarde said and it requires a delicate mix of policies in other words it should be handled with care three mutually reinforcing policy areas in order to ensure that policy missteps are avoided and right policies are adopted lagarde said three areas of action are mutually reinforcing one another namely domestic policies cross border policies and coordinated efforts to tackle the major global challenges that we all face on the domestic policy front lagarde said that there is not a one size fits all approach and that policies should be customized to meet the needs of individual countries the reality is that many economies are not resilient enough she said adding that high public debt and low interest rates have left policy makers with limited room to act in the face of what she predicted to be an inevitable arrival of a next round of economic downturn lagarde called on countries to make smarter use of fiscal policy and strike the right balance between growth debt sustainability and social objectives the smarter use of fiscal policy she added involves the continual hard work of upgrading tax systems mobilizing domestic revenue prioritizing growth friendly expenditure reducing public debt where needed the managing director also highlighted the necessity of addressing excessive inequality saying that fiscal policy can play a key role in that aspect by means of progressive tax measures that should be country specific and stronger safety nets that can help address dislocations caused by technological change and globalization lagarde sounded an alarm on a current trend that is especially evident in the digital economy where a small number of highly dynamic companies accounted for the highest price markups she suggested that appropriate measures such as reducing barriers to entry for new firms and reforming competition framework to ensure a level playing field in all sectors be taken to prevent the phenomenon from evolving into a monopoly problem with regard to cross border policies lagarde said there are a wide range of economic issues that need to be addressed including upgrading financial regulations improving debt transparency tackling illicit financial flows among others she said it s true that not everyone has benefited from global trade and there are distortions in the trade system and the system needs to be reformed but trade barriers are not the answer according to lagarde the imf after analyzing the experience from 180 countries over the past six decades found that trade integration clearly boosts investment in plant machinery and many other high job creating areas conversely she added trade barriers clearly damage investment and employment lagarde said the finding is of particular relevance now as ongoing trade tensions around the world could further damage investment at a time when investment is already weak the united states has blamed several of its trading partners for running trade surpluses with it and resorted to the imposition of tariffs to reduce the gaps the fact is that historically bilateral trade balances have been driven mostly by macroeconomic factors not bilateral tariffs lagarde said adding that the most effective way to reduce a bilateral trade deficit is to steer clear of tariffs because tariffs on the goods of one country only divert trade flows to other countries nobody wins a trade war that is why we need to work together to reduce trade barriers and modernize the global trade system so that we all win she said in addition the managing director also called for collective action to modernize the key functions of the world trade organization wto such effort should be made to improve the wto s negotiating process transparency of the organization as well as its dispute resolution mechanism lagarde said on tackling common threats faced by the international community as a whole lagarde singled out combating climate change and fighting against corruption having just recently become a grand mother i must say that the challenge of making the planet a better place for our children and grand children has taken on a special resonance for me she added speaking of curbing corruption lagarde cited a new study by the imf which showed that less corruption is associated with high tax revenues and that better governance is often linked with higher student test scores and more efficient spending on vital infrastructure this highlights the potentially huge benefit of curbing corruption and not only fiscal benefit but also the potential benefit to society at large she said tuesday s event came about a week ahead of the imf and world bank s spring meetings scheduled for april 12 14
yangon nearly three dozen national leaders will land in beijing late this month to attend the 2nd belt and road forum among them will be myanmar state counselor daw aung san suu kyi who is expected to negotiate agreements on at least six projects as part of the china myanmar economic corridor upon signing the memorandum of understanding mou for the china myanmar economic corridor cmec in september last year the myanmar government officially became a partner in china s ambitious belt and road initiative bri china has proposed 30 projects as part of the bri chinese president xi jinping s signature foreign policy the bri is a grand vision to revive the historic silk road trade route and create a 21st century maritime silk road these would create a network of trade routes from china to europe passing through central asia the middle east and russia unveiled in 2013 the bri will ultimately encompass nearly 70 countries and two thirds of the world s population however for the past two years the bri has faced resistance from a number of countries some have decided that while participation could help their development they want to seek a renegotiation of the terms some key countries lying on beijing s signature routes whose involvement is needed to build highly ambitious infrastructure projects have declared they will reconsider all the agreements to ensure there is no risk of a debt trap and that all terms and conditions are fair concerns in se asia last year was a rocky one for the bri after malaysia elected a new government led by prime minister mahathir mohamad who canceled us 18 billion more than 27 trillion kyats worth of bri projects comprising a rail link and two gas pipelines being constructed by a chinese company a move he said was necessary in order to avoid a huge debt trap he also called for the renegotiation or cancellation of unfair deals with beijing authorized by his predecessor najib razak who now faces prosecution involving a massive financial scandal pakistan s government led by prime minister imran khan decided to review and revise all the china pakistan economic corridor cpec projects due to their perceived unfairness to pakistani companies in the maldives president ibrahim mohamed solih who beat a pro china president in the country s recent election is renegotiating bri project related debt and the west african country of sierra leone recently canceled a 400 million chinese funded project to build a new airport outside the capital freetown to avoid a heavy debt burden as a precautionary measure before joining the forum the leaders of indonesia and malaysia recently publicized the terms and conditions for chinese investors aiming to secure bri agreements indonesia has announced that chinese investors must abide by the four conditions to use only environmentally friendly technologies to maximize the use of local labor to transfer technical knowledge to local partners through training programs and to ensure that the projects create added value for indonesian industries to reduce the country s dependence on extractive industries such as mining and to benefit the country s economy in the long term last month when asked by the south china morning post for his views on the bri before joining the forum the malaysian prime minister warned other countries to make sure that the money flowing into their country is not borrowed from china he emphasized that countries that do become mired in debt traps must accept some responsibility for their predicament he explained this was why malaysia preferred direct investment over projects funded by chinese loans he said he welcomed chinese investment and economic resources but was not receptive to its control or influence myanmar easy prey in myanmar the cmec will stretch for 1 700 km starting in china s yunnan province and going through myanmar s major economic cities mandalay in central myanmar and the commercial capital of yangon and reaching the coast at the kyaukphyu special economic zone sez in rakhine state the proposal includes upgrades to three major roads through mandalay and muse on the myanmar side of the border with china and some other roads in shan state mandalay region finance and planning minister u myat thu a member of a joint committee on the bri told the irrawaddy that myanmar has agreed to speed up the progress of nine major projects among the 30 proposed by china however the minister didn t identify the nine projects the government hasn t officially announced the list of cmec projects yet except for construction plans for three economic cooperation zones along the myanmar china border in shan and kachin states however under the cmec myanmar has also signed an mou for the kyaukphyu deep sea port a potential hub for china that would give it direct access to the indian ocean and allow its oil imports to bypass the strait of malacca it also serves beijing s goal of developing china s landlocked yunnan province in yangon the multi billion dollar new yangon city project is a part of the cmec plan a framework agreement was recently signed for the project which is envisioned as a complex of new towns industrial parks and urban development projects despite warnings from critics that the project could burden myanmar with unsustainable debt and provoke more armed conflict in the project areas in october two state owned companies china railway eryuan engineering group china railway group ltd creeg and myanmar railways signed an mou to conduct a feasibility study on the muse mandalay high speed railway a project that will link two economic centers in myanmar with kunming the capital of yunnan province in southwestern china the project is part of beijing s grand infrastructure plan for the region the muse mandalay railway is also the initial stage in a strategic railway link that beijing plans to build with a parallel expressway from ruili in yunnan province to kyaukphyu in rakhine along with a separate road running through northern myanmar india s northeastern states and bangladesh however myanmar s leaders have been silent on their plans and policies for bri projects amid rising resentment toward china due to its efforts to revive the controversial myitsone dam on the country s lifeline river the irrawaddy on the other hand experts including from the world bank have pointed out that myanmar s growth will largely depend on major bri infrastructure projects that get underway this year the irrawaddy has learned that the myanmar government is drafting a master plan relating to the cmec this includes some significant conditions including that identified projects are to be selected through a public tender process and that myanmar should be allowed to borrow from multiple sources if debt financing is required however the content of the master plan is very broad in terms of debt policy the public tender process and labor rights experts have pointed out that it is difficult to obtain loans from other countries for china related projects in terms of the open tender process critics say that even if there are a few competitors it is highly unlikely that a non chinese company would win a bri project deputy planning and finance minister u set aung said the projects under the cemc must be in line with the myanmar sustainable development plan msdp drawn up by the current government to achieve genuine inclusive and transformational economic growth the head of the china desk at the institute of strategy and policy isp myanmar daw khin khin kyaw kyee told the irrawaddy that while there is nothing wrong with the strategies outlined in the msdp the government has still not disclosed how it plans to implement them on the ground the government doesn t have the necessary mechanisms to implement the msdp with regard to the cmec daw khin khin kyaw kyee said the msdp obliges the government to listen to the public s voices and wishes when it comes to implementing or making decisions related to the projects she pointed out that the public has received little information about the cmec projects since the government signed the agreement when the public is not given general information about the agreement how can we say there is transparency she asked of the government s lack of effort to publicize information on the projects experts have suggested that as a developing country half of whose existing foreign debt is held by china myanmar should implement individual rules and regulations relating to bri projects such as requiring counter project proposals inviting experts to review mega projects and adopting international standards for environmental issues and debt policies in march 2018 a report by the washington based center for global development said china was putting many countries under the bri at financial risk through a series of aid activities and huge amounts of lending myanmar can learn from other countries that became highly indebted from bri projects thitinan pongsudhirak an associate professor at the institute of security and international studies in the faculty of political science at bangkok s chulalongkorn university told the irrawaddy myanmar can set up a debt law which puts a ceiling on how much foreign loans the country can take out and be sustainable based on macroeconomic conditions such as international reserves export growth and gdp expansion he said cooperation not confrontation led by state counselor daw aung san suu kyi myanmar s bri steering committee comprises 25 members including 18 union ministers from ministries ranging from home affairs to hotels and tourism five chief ministers from kachin mandalay rakhine yangon and shan the foreign affairs permanent secretary and the chairman of the naypyitaw council according to u aung naing oo the director general of the directorate of investment and company administration projects under the bri must be reviewed by the bri steering committee and cleared by the myanmar investment commission daw khin khin kyaw kyee said they should invite experts who can negotiate at the table with china s representatives the government only considers cmec projects based on china s proposals when in fact it should propose counter projects based on what will benefit the country and meet the people s needs she said for example while china has proposed bri projects the indonesian government has proposed nearly 30 projects worth us 91 1 billion based on the country s own strategic plans whenever we discuss china s irresponsible manner of investment practices they tell me that we follow the myanmar government s rule and regulations that shows we don t have enough rules and regulations in line with international standards she said she pointed out that the updated version of myanmar s investment law fails to expressly require maximum use of local workers in foreign investment projects despite public wariness surrounding chinese investment in the country the humanitarian crisis in rakhine has pushed myanmar back into the hands of the chinese at the country s first investment forum in late january while talking about infrastructure challenges u thaung tun said he wants to take advantage of myanmar s strategic location at the intersection of two of the world s most important emerging markets china and india he emphasized that myanmar is central to the bri saying that if you look at the bri you will find that myanmar is in the middle of all of it because the maritime silk road must pass through myanmar the minister stressed to the audience that the rise of china should not be seen as an obstacle as he believes all countries can benefit from bri projects we can do cooperation rather than confrontation it will help development not just in the region but also the world he said adding that myanmar could be a transport hub for asia under the bri as china continues its global infrastructure financing push across the developing world allegations of debt diplomacy keep arising according to media reports when the bri was first announced china s foreign currency reserves stood at around us 4 trillion during the past five years the reserves have fallen to us 3 trillion as beijing seeks to offload pressure on the yuan and provide contracts for chinese companies that take an interest in spending some of those reserves overseas according to the american chamber of commerce chinese companies are under pressure from u s tariffs and factory activity in china has been steadily contracting with export orders falling at rates not seen since the financial crisis a decade ago as a result experts speculate that chinese companies will be saddled with debt and find it difficult to run foreign projects like those under the bri in the near future according to the media reports more than 270 out of 1 814 bri projects undertaken since 2013 in the indo pacific region have been halted due to concerns over practicality or financial viability daw khin khin kyaw kyee said both sides should negotiate and implement in a manner that is fair transparent and to the benefit of the host country not just the investor before we make further agreements with china we should have a certain master plan or rules and regulations that can assure benefits for the people of myanmar she said

the company believes these non ifrs measures are important supplemental measures of operating performance because they eliminate items that have less bearing on the company s operating performance and thus highlight trends in its core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on ifrs financial measures the company also believes that securities analysts investors rating agencies and other interested parties frequently use these non ifrs measures in the evaluation of issuers many of which present similar metrics when reporting their results the company s management also uses adjusted ebitdar in order to facilitate retail business operating performance comparisons from period to period prepare annual operating budgets and assess the company s ability to meet its future debt service capital expenditure and working capital requirements and the company s ability to pay dividends on its common shares as other companies may calculate these non ifrs measures differently than the company these metrics may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies this press release makes reference to certain comparable financial results expressed on a constant currency basis including comparable sales comparable digital sales and comparable inventory in calculating the sales change including digital sales on a constant currency basis where applicable prior year foreign exchange rates are applied to both current year and prior year comparable sales additionally where an acquisition closed in the previous twelve months comparable sales change on a constant currency basis incorporate results from the pre acquisition period this enhances the ability to compare underlying sales trends by excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as by reflecting new acquisitions the company calculates comparable inventory levels on a year over year constant currency basis and does not include i acquisitions not closed prior to the end of the same comparable quarter of the prior fiscal year and ii new store openings after the end of the same comparable quarter of the prior fiscal year definitions and calculations of comparable financial results differ among companies in the retail industry the company notes that results from acquisitions are only incorporated in the company s reported consolidated financial results from and after the respective acquisition date all comparative sales figures are for the thirteen week and fifty two week periods ended february 2 2019 compared to the thirteen week

she is increasing the risk of the calamity of a corbyn government brexit minister steven barclay said may is not handling a blank check to corbyn and there is no precondition for the discussions with labour corbyn emphasized that anything agreed with may need to be put into law so that it is guaranteed for the parliament pro eu labour lawmaker ben bradshaw warned that it is clearly a trap designed to try to get may s terrible deal through which some people have fallen for but labour mustn t scottish first minister nicola sturgeon poured cold water and said the meeting would produce an option that it won t take too long for people to realize satisfies nobody makes the country poorer and potentially could be unpicked by a new prime minister such as boris johnson on the eu side european council president donald tusk said it was not certain how european leaders would view another request of delay from may eu s economic affairs and tax commissioner pierre moscovici said if there is a no deal scenario new customs controls would have to be introduced that does not mean we would systematically check every single lorry we would be controlling goods on the basis of risk analysis uk pmi services dropped to 48 9 risk of sliding into a deepening downturn in coming months uk pmi services dropped to 48 9 in march down from 51 3 and missed expectation of 51 3 that s the first contraction reading since july 2016 markit noted slight reduction in service sector activity new orders fall for the third month running in march and prices charged increase at the slowest pace since june 2017 all sector pmi dropped to 50 0 down from 51 4 chris williamson chief business economist at ihs markit said a drop in service sector activity indicates that uk gdp contracted in march with the economy stalling over the first quarter as a whole and at risk of sliding into a deepening downturn in coming months both the services and construction sectors are now in decline and manufacturing is only expanding because of emergency stockpiling ahead of brexit also a stalling of the economy in the first quarter will therefore likely turn into a downturn in the second quarter unless demand revives suddenly which given the recent escalation of brexit uncertainty seems highly improbable such a scenario leaves the current consensus forecast for the uk economy to grow 1 3 in 2019 looking far too optimistic ihs markit currently expects to see just 0 8 growth in 2019 and even this modest performance is perhaps somewhat hopeful given the recent lack of any brexit developments eurozone pmi

current levels the pmi remains consistent with gdp rising by 0 2 in the first quarter but unless manufacturing pulls out of its downturn the overall pace of economic growth will likely weaken in the second quarter as the malaise spreads to the service sector in this respect with forward looking indicators from the manufacturing sector suggesting goods production will fall further in the coming

it is not fair to ask any country including china to introduce radical reforms in a few months since there is a need for time and preparedness the u s on the other hand has already given enough time to china when it was integrated into the global economy upon joining the world trade organization wto since then china has introduced some sweeping reforms however it is being pushed for even more reforms due to increasing complaints from the u s it should be noted that some of china s policies such as forcing american and western companies to transfer their technologies to chinese partners have played a vital role in the technological transformation of modern china through fast and efficient development through this technological transformation china has become a rival to the u s in several fields such as artificial intelligence therefore naturally china may not be willing to further enact reforms on these policies while the u s demands fair access into the chinese market for its own and the world s interest in 2018 a trade war erupted between the two economic superpowers china and the u s the first move was made by u s president donald trump as he decided to impose tariffs between 10 and 25 percent on chinese goods in return china canceled soybean imports from the u s the primary motivation for the u s tariffs was to decrease the trade imbalance with china the tariff war the first round of import tariffs on chinese products was imposed on over 50 billion worth of goods the second round was on 200 billion worth of goods from china and took effect on sept 24 2018 additionally the trump administration signaled that it could very well impose import tariffs on all chinese products this meant an additional 250 billion worth of chinese products would be affected in retaliation china imposed tariffs on 50 billion of american goods in response to the first round of american import tariffs after the second round of american tariffs china responded with retaliatory tariffs on another 60 billion worth of american goods in 2018 both sides met in buenos aires before the g20 summit however there was no official agreement between them as both sides were not willing to make concessions this disagreement continued at the asia pacific economic cooperation apec meeting in papua new guinea in 2018 u s vice president mike pence said the u s though will not change course until china changes its ways after a round of retaliatory tariffs and discourses towards each other eventually president trump and chinese president xi jinping agreed on a 90 day timeline for an agreement to solve the trade dispute between their two sides during a meeting on dec 1 2018 in buenos aires therefore president trump delayed the activation of additional tariffs on 200 billion dollars worth of chinese products additionally before the march 1 deadline for any possible agreement the leading negotiator for the trump administration robert lighthizer emphasized that the u s needs to keep the tariff threat on the table for years this was suggested in order to hold china to account washington s demands since trump took office in january 2017 there have been a couple of times that official complaints have been made in regards to trade issues between the u s and china the u s demands several reforms in regards to economic and trade policies during his interview with hong kong s south china morning post scmp china s ambassador to the u s cui tiankai explained that the reforms demanded by the trump administration could take years to be realized due to the chinese legislative process in addition he hoped that the u s would be respectful to china as to the need for time to plan a framework for extensive reforms the u s has accused china of stealing intellectual property and technology a forced transfer of technology to chinese partners in return for easy business in china chinese state backed cyberattacks on american companies and of artificially undervaluing the yuan as a result the u s increased pressure on china to enact economic and trade structural reforms that include government subsidies to companies protection of intellectual property and forced transfer of american technology to chinese partners what do the numbers suggest according to the office of the u s trade representative ustr website the total trade volume in 2017 was 635 billion the u s trade deficit with china was 375 billion in 2017 while there was a chinese surplus of over 350 billion in 2018 chinese exports to the u s were over 500 billion while american exports were roughly 130 billion in 2017 according to the website www thebalance com the u s imported 77 billion worth of computers and accessories 70 billion worth of cell phones and 54 billion worth of apparel and footwear on the other hand china imported commercial aircraft soybeans and autos from the u s worth 16 billion 12 billion and 10 billion respectively the economic confrontation between the u s and china has already affected both sides china s biggest concern is that this trade war with the u s may slow its economic growth in 2019 with growth predicted to be between 6 2 and 6 6 percent for 2019 in 2018 the growth rate was 6 6 percent the weakest in 28 years according to reuters according to some circles this trade war may affect even employment if no deal could be struck with the u s on the other hand the american economy has also started feeling the effect of the trade war with china as uncertainty continues an example is an increase in stock prices due to there being no solution to the american chinese trade war furthermore investors are cautious about the ongoing economic difficulties and many choose to wait rather than invest or get out of markets it is predicted that the u s economic growth will be around 2 2 percent in 2019 and less in 2020 according to the new york times economic growth was 2 9 percent in 2018 however in this war it seems china may be affected more than the u s because chinese exports to the u s were more than 500 billion in 2017 while american exports to china were around 130 billion in 2017 therefore it was expected that china and the u s might come to a deal in washington until march 1 however there is still no confirmation from both sides it means they extended the period for the ongoing talks additionally it has been revealed that china s offer on jan 7 9 in beijing included several areas such as agricultural goods and industrial commodities in addition to eliminating the trade imbalance with the u s within a couple of years i am sure that the u s under the trump administration will not give up until an agreement can be made on issues such as the protection of intellectual property and the issue of technology transfer between american and chinese companies the effects of further escalationthere is no doubt that this escalation between the two most powerful nations in the international system will have a negative impact on the world economy according to janus henderson investors the worst case scenario in this intensifying trade conflict is that it may cause a global recession international organizations such as the international monetary fund imf and the world bank have warned about the worsening global economic and trade conditions in the midst of the american chinese trade war lastly the imf predicted global growth for 2019 would be 3 5 percent a downgrade to the initial prediction of 3 7 percent growth for 2019 in october 2018 president trump and the leader of north korea kim jong un met in vietnam for a second round of talks over denuclearization this was the second time since the singapore summit that the two leaders have met however there was no satisfactory result for both sides due to there being no new agreements some have deemed this meeting a failure however kim showed his willingness for future dialogue with the u s it seems that the unwillingness of kim for full denuclearization without any gain such as the lifting of sanctions was a clear reason for no deal being made if it takes more than two meetings between the u s and north korea over several issues so it is not logical to expect something fast from the trade talks between the u s and china in washington this would be the second time the two nations are meeting under the trump administration following the meeting in beijing the vietnam summit ended abruptly president trump left hanoi earlier than scheduled which is a clear sign that the u s wants a definite result in regards to its talks and can walk away at any time if there was no satisfactory deal consequently it seems the u s and china need more time to make a comprehensive deal on the disputed issues hence the world can expect to see more meetings between the two most important components of the global economy the meetings in washington may end up with chinese promises to buy more from china and easier access to the chinese market for american companies however the structural reforms requested by the u s may take more rounds of talk over several years ph d candidate in international relations at the

the international monetary fund says the nigerian economy is recovering with increased gross domestic product gdp in 2018 and falling inflation at the end of 2018 the executive board of the imf stated this in its report at the conclusion of the board s consultation with nigeria according to a statement issued in washington dc by a spokesperson for the fund lucie fouda imf said nigeria s economy is recovering real gdp increased by 1 9 per cent in 2018 up from 0 8 per cent in 2017 on the back of improvements in manufacturing and services supported by spillovers from higher oil prices ongoing convergence in exchange rates and strides to improve the business environment headline inflation fell to 11 4 per cent at end 2018 reflecting declining food price inflation weak consumer demand a relatively stable exchange rate and tight monetary policy during most of 2018 but remains outside of the central bank s target range of 6 9 per cent record holdings of mostly short term local debt and equity and a current account surplus lifted gross international reserves to a peak in april 2018 while the three times oversubscribed november 2018 eurobond helped cushion the impact of outflows later in the year imf said however persisting structural and policy challenges continue to constrain growth to levels below those needed to reduce vulnerabilities lessen poverty and improve weak human development outcomes such as in health and education the bank said a large infrastructure gap low revenue mobilisation governance and institutional weaknesses continued foreign exchange restrictions and banking sector vulnerabilities were dampening long term foreign and domestic investment and keeping the economy reliant on volatile oil prices and production under current policies the outlook remains therefore muted over the medium term absent strong reforms growth would hover around 2½ per cent implying no per capita growth as the economy faces limited increases in oil production and insufficient adjustment four years after the oil price shock monetary policy focused on exchange rate stability would help contain inflation but worsen competitiveness if greater flexibility is not accommodated when needed high financing costs on the back of little fiscal adjustment would continue to constrain private sector credit and the interest to revenue ratio would remain high risks are moderately tilted downwards on the upside oil prices could rise prompted by global political disruptions or supply bottlenecks bold reform efforts following the election cycle could boost confidence and investments especially given relatively conservative baseline projections on the downside additional delays in reform implementation a persistent fall in oil prices reduced oil production increased security tensions or tighter global financial market conditions could undermine growth provoke a market sell off and put additional pressure on reserves and or the exchange rate the fund said the executive directors in their assessment welcomed nigeria s ongoing economic recovery accompanied by reduced inflation and strengthened reserve buffers they noted however that the medium term outlook remains muted with risks tilted to the downside in addition long standing structural and policy challenges need to be tackled more decisively to reduce vulnerabilities raise per capita growth and bring down poverty they said directors therefore urged the authorities to redouble their reform efforts and supported their intention to accelerate implementation of their economic recovery and growth plan they welcomed the nigerian authorities tax reform plan to increase non oil revenue including through tax policy and administration measures they stressed the importance of strengthening domestic revenue mobilisation including through additional excises a comprehensive value added tax reform and elimination of tax incentives securing oil revenues through reforms of state owned enterprises and measures to improve the governance of the oil sector will also be crucial they said directors highlighted the importance of shifting the expenditure mix toward priority areas they welcomed in this context the significant increase in public investment but underlined the need for greater investment efficiency while also recommending increasing funding for health and education they noted that phasing out implicit fuel subsidies while strengthening social safety nets to mitigate the impact on the most vulnerable would help reduce the poverty gap and free up additional fiscal space with inflation still above the central bank target directors generally considered that a tight monetary policy stance is appropriate they also urged ending direct central bank intervention in the economy to allow focus on the central bank s price stability mandate directors commended the authorities commitment to unify the exchange rate and welcomed the increasing convergence of foreign exchange windows they noted that a unified market based exchange rate and a more flexible exchange rate regime would support inflation targeting directors also stressed that elimination of exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices would remove distortions and facilitate economic diversification they welcomed the decline in nonperforming loans and the improved prudential banking ratios but noted that restructured loans and undercapitalised banks continue to weigh on financial sector performance directors also recommended establishing a credible time bound recapitalisation plan for weak banks and a timeline for phasing out the state backed asset management company amcon directors urged the authorities to reinvigorate implementation of structural reforms to diversify the economy and achieve the sustainable development goals they pointed to the importance of improving the business environment implementing the power sector recovery programme deepening financial inclusion reforming the health and education sectors and implementing policies to reduce gender inequities directors welcomed improvements in the quality and availability of economic statistics and encouraged continued efforts to address remaining gaps including through regular funding nan
consider this it is 1607 the english have been taking lands in ireland for several centuries first written down in the 7th century irish customary law is sophisticated and still administered by trained traditional magistrates brehons now rulings in the english courts on gavelkind 1605 and tanistry 1607 finally deny that customary law delivers property rights family holdings are made tenancies of by now well established anglo irish elites and the commons crucial to grazing and hunting are made more absolutely the property of the elites and new waves of english and scottish settlers irish communities may use the commons at the will of these new owners now 1823 in america chief justice marshall rules that while indian natives were rightfully in possession aboriginal title of 43 000 square miles of disputed land in a case he engineers to be brought before the supreme court and in which he has a private interest they illegally sold this tract to developers he argues that by virtue of conquest the british crown became the owner of north america the right of discovery therefore only the crown or its administrations may lawfully sell or grant lands possession is no more than lawful occupation and use and doesn t count forty year old opinions of the privy council in london aid marshall s argument these opinions established in 1772 and 1774 that english law supersedes local law and that for the purposes of property land is uninhabited unowned when empty of civilized people mcauslan 2006 1845 in england the villagers of otmoor oxfordshire in england as described by linebaugh in this volume have lost the fight to keep their commons as have hundreds of other communities across the realm in fact feudal land law in england and the rest of europe has dictated for some centuries since 1285 that only those granted land by the king i e the lords own the land local populations hold no more than use rights these legal realities have come harshly into focus only with industrialization and with private capital hungry for lands and the financial killings which may be made from selling the commons to railways and factories parliament made up of wealthy landlords is on their side passing law after law since 1773 to legalize the dispossession of commoners the inclosure act 1845 administers the coup de grace speeding up the process of course private gains under these parliamentary enclosures are in the public interest 1895 in africa a decade earlier the plenipotentiaries of european powers as they refer to themselves agreed to establish respective spheres of economic influence throughout the continent and make key entry points like the niger and congo rivers free trade zones as the newest industrial power and especially anxious to extend trade germany hosts the meeting in berlin in 1884 85 europe is in economic crisis the great depression 1873 1896 factory owners desperately need new markets for unsold textiles and other manufactures fabulously wealthy entrepreneurs with vast accumulations of capital burning holes in their owners pockets hobsbawn 1987 also seek new enterprises to invest in the new working classes having lost their livelihoods and now dependent upon failing factory jobs are also in need of new locales to migrate to the matter is so important that the powers create an early international trade law the general act of the berlin conference on west africa 1885 in practice opening markets and enterprise in africa does not work out so well and free trade goes out the window by 1895 the economic scramble for africa has segued into a political scramble with the creation of colonies and protectorates to protect new markets and tap the increasingly apparent wealth of resources and cheap labor in the african hinterlands the problem from the 1890s is how to acquire such massive lands cheaply for some time traders profiteers and missionaries have been buying lands from coastal chiefs to create trading posts ports missionary enclaves and more recently for anti slavery monitoring posts companies backed by european governments have been doing the same the british royal niger company alone has several hundred land contracts made with west african chiefs guaranteeing access to land for mainly commercial oil palm production supporting inter alia the burgeoning soap industry in europe chiefs are now selling exploration rights to gold mining companies such purchases suggest that european governments are amply aware that africa is far from unowned there is also the 1844 bond to consider this is a bilateral investment treaty signed between sovereigns of equal power along the gold coast and the british crown nor are such kings and chiefs naive with a long history of slave and commodity trading behind them and well established trade missions and embassies in european capitals luckily the old feudal land laws of europe along with the marshall ruling of 1823 mentioned above come to the rescue these offer a clutch of routes to legalize dispossession at scale legality is of concern to colonizers and their parliaments not least to appease humanist groups at home who count the abolition of slavery as a first success but the right of discovery assures the colonizers undisputed ownership of the soil this may not work so well along coastal areas but can be amply applied to hinterland areas natives themselves unwittingly open the way many of them claim that only god can own the soil or that their communities continuing from the past into the present and future are the owners while firm in their respective schemes of possession they admit the land itself cannot be sold at least not without the consent of communities to europeans this conceded lack of fungibility and tendency to communalism proves that africans do not own their lands in the manner european property laws acknowledge where bills of sale have queered the pitch natives may be guaranteed secure occupancy and use for as long as they actively occupy and farm the land it would not in any event be wise to make it difficult for natives to feed themselves conditionality of occupation and use leaves the attractive prospect that europeans may claim ownership of several billon hectares of unsettled and unfarmed lands in short the communal property within their customary domains have not smith locke mills and others established long ago that private property only comes into existence by the hand of man s labor the concept of wastes from feudal tenures is neatly applied to the continent by all colonizing powers counterpoint constructs of effectively occupied lands in the form of settlements and permanent farms and unowned and vacant lands quickly evolve in the absence of acknowledged owners the commons fall directly to colonial administrations as their private property and if there is still any doubt it is obvious to the white men that the lucrative forests wetlands and grasslands of africa cannot amount to property as they are in communal possession in europe private property means individual property moreover property obtains legal protection only when an individual person or company has a deed to prove it africans do not in oddly mixed ways these various proofs of terra nullius are applied legal dispossession of africans is more or less total in practice the ability of colonizers to settle and develop more than a million or so hectares in each new polity is constrained south africa aside natives continue to occupy and use lands which they no longer legally own through the 20th century major colonial incursions are made into these lands although cities and towns multiply they prove more notable for the conflicts they generate than the actual hectares they absorb settler schemes commercial plantations run by parastatals and private enterprise take a much greater toll along with evictions caused by the issuance of concessions to foreign enterprises for oil mining and timber exploitation laws are also passed declaring certain resources generically the property of the state minerals surface mined for centuries or not waters beachfronts marshlands mountains forests and woodlands fall like ninepins to the state irrespective of local possession the 1960s in africa liberation from europe begins mid century curiously colonial notions of tenure are sustained in most post independence land laws or perhaps not so curiously for keeping rural majorities as tenants at will is as useful to new african governments as it had been to colonial masters class formation and land commoditization have grown apace since the 1940s the new african middle class share not only political power and business interests but the same deep commitments to market led development so strongly advocated by the new donors the former colonizers and international agencies positions expressed in the landmark studies of late colonialism in anglophone 1955 and francophone officialdom 1959 become embedded national policies in africa reinforced by the land policies of the world bank 1975 these read little differently from those of malthus and lloyd as recorded by linebaugh land privatization is prerequisite to productivity indigenous tenure regimes in general and communal landholding in particular are to be done away with as obstructions to individual centric economic growth to allow the polarization needed to produce a landless class for urban industrialization and fewer and larger native land owners assisted to produce food and commodities at scale as is now so well known garrett hardin confusing collective group owned property with open access regimes adds his penny s worth to destructively good effect 1968 all over africa and asia privatization schemes are launched aiming to individualize title and register houses and farms alden wily 2011 where these work such as in kenya commons are subdivided among wealthier farmers or they are handed over to governments as forest and wildlife reserves or state run commercial agriculture developments ultimately the reach of privatization schemes is limited so that by 1990 only around 10 percent of the rural lands of africa are subject to statutory entitlement and most of this in the white settler areas of southern africa but this is not problematic for african administrations who continue to dispose of untitled customarily owned lands at will often to themselves or other private interests 1990 in africa despite privatization pressures the customary sector remains dominant as the century nears end half a billion africans are still regulating their land relations according to community based norms shaped by customs but adjusted regularly to meet changing realities despite significant failures in the 1970s and 1980s governments hold tenaciously to mechanized large scale farming as the route to growth smallholder agriculture remains starved of investment even though customary smallholders represent the overwhelming majority families eke out a living on less and less farmland per capita levels of concentration and farm landlessness within the african peasant sector look increasingly like those of south asia in the 1960s but where the commons remain these routinely make the difference between pauperization and survival as in linebaugh s village of otmoor over a century past the unfarmed commons continue to provide a host of services and products from pasture to pannage to fish and fowl and the waters needed to irrigate farms woodlands and forests are especially valuable doubling the livelihood of the poor in many areas iucn 2010 and of course the rural poor are the majority some 75 percent of the rural population democratization in the 1990s provokes tenure reforms often following years of bitter social conflict a handful of governments most notably uganda mozambique and tanzania acknowledge that africans cannot remain forever squatters of their own land alden wily 2011 they pass new land laws which for the first time endow customary rights with the legal force of real property and irrespective of whether or not these interests are formally titled and registered or owned by individuals families or communities the last opens the way for communities to secure thousands of hectares of commonage as acknowledged collective property however as well as being flawed in diverse ways these cases are the exceptions most governments continue to avoid real change to their land laws world bank structural adjustment programs aid and abet this coercing governments to accelerate privatization and sell off untitled lands including the commons to foreign investors now consider this it is 2011 hundreds of rural communities in africa as well as parts of asia and latin america are physically confronted with eviction or displacement or simply truncation of their livelihoods and lands they customarily presume to be their own these lands are willfully reallocated by their governments to mainly foreign investors to the tune of an estimated 220 million hectares since mainly 2007 and still rising two thirds of the lands being sold or mainly leased are in poverty stricken and investment hungry africa large scale deals for hundreds of thousands of hectares dominate although deals for smaller areas acquired by domestic investors run apace world bank 2010 this is the global land rush triggered by crises in oil and food markets of the last decade and compounded by the financial crisis the latter adds backing and raises the speculative stakes enormously the crisis provides lucrative new investment opportunities to sovereign wealth funds hedge funds and global agribusiness the new entrepreneurs with accumulated capital burning holes in their owners pockets global shifts in economic power are evident while western actors continue to dominate as land acquirers the brics brazil russia india china and food insecure middle eastern oil states are active competitors a regional bias is beginning to show china and malaysia dominate land acquisition in asia while south africa shows signs of future dominance in africa two south african farmer enclaves already exist in nigeria and congo brazzaville has granted 88 000 hectares with promises of up to ten million hectares to follow negotiations are ongoing in at least 20 other african states hall 2011 what foreign governments and other investors primarily seek are lands to feed the lucrative biofuel market by producing sugar cane jatropha and especially oil palm at scale they also want to produce food crops and livestock for home economies bypassing unreliable and expensive international food markets additionally investors seek to launch lucrative horticultural floricultural and carbon credit schemes for all this cheap deals are needed cheap land us 0 50 per hectare in many cases duty free import of their equipment duty free export of their products tax free status for their staff and production and low interest loans often acquired from local banks on the basis of the new land titles they receive this rush for land the new landgrab does not stand alone local banks communications infrastructural projects tourism ventures and local industry are also being bought up with a vengeance these take advantage of the new market liberalization that poor agrarian governments now finally provide after decades of nagging by international financial institutions for host governments foreign investment is the new aid and path to economic growth firmly facilitated by international agencies daniel 2011 local land speculation flourishes in its service the promise of jobs is more or less the only immediate benefit to national populations and experience thus far suggests these are not materializing nor is the phenomenon a one way street extending and entrenching competitive spheres of economic influence is also on the agenda foreign capture of population rich new markets for home manufactures is actively sought alongside land deals this is best illustrated in the largely foreign capital buy in and buy up of special economic zones sez most advanced in india but emerging elsewhere such as in the chinese shenzhen planned in eight african states brautigam 2011 should these develop they will provide tariff free entry for chinese goods at scale and locales for chinese producers and laborers seeking to escape the saturation of home markets bilateral investment treaties of which nearly five thousand have been signed between north and south states over the last decade provide the governing framework for these developments in short economic crises and shifts in the balance of political power once again produce seismic shifts in who owns and controls land resources and production but where are the poor and the commons in all this the commons and commoners the answer is quite simple much of the lands being sold or leased to entrepreneurs are commons this is not surprising because lands defined as commons in the modern agrarian world generally exclude permanent farms and settlements governments and investors prefer to avoid settled lands as their dispossession is most likely to provoke resistance they also want to avoid having to pay compensation for huts and standing crops or for relocation only the unfarmed commons the forest woodlands rangelands and wetlands can supply the thousands of hectares large scale investors want but most of all the commons are deemed vacant and available for the laws of most host lessor states still treat all customarily owned lands and unfarmed lands in particular as unowned unoccupied and idle as such they remain the property of the state this makes their onward sale or lease to private investors perfectly legal indeed without such legality in domestic land law and investor friendly international trade law to take their side in international courts if needed no international or local investor would proceed of course the commons are neither unutilized or idle nor unowned on the contrary under local tenure norms virtually no land is or ever has been unowned and this remains the case despite the century long subordination of such customary rights as no more than permissive possession occupancy and use of unowned lands or lands owned by the state in practice customary ownership is nested in spatial domains the territory of one community extending to the boundaries of the next while the exact location of intercommunity boundaries are routinely challenged and contested there is little doubt in the locality as to which community owns and controls which area within each of these domains property rights are complex and various the most usual distinction drawn today is between rights over permanent house and farm plots and rights over the residual commons rights over the former are increasingly absolute in the hands of families and increasingly alienable rights over commons are collective held in undivided shares and while they exist in perpetuity are generally inalienable this is not least because the owner the community is a continuing intergenerational entity this does not mean that in the right circumstances parts or even all of a community s commons cannot be leased whether the community wishes to do so or not is communities believe a matter for commoners to decide clearly most domestic statutory legislation does not agree let alone consider these critical estates in land to be community assets in the first instance the results of this continuing denial that property ownership exists except as recognized by imported european laws are clear for all to see in the current land rush not just commons but occupied farms and houses are routinely being lost as investors move in in democratic republic of the congo for example villagers with homesteads scattered in the forest have lost their entire domains to commercial crop farmers and now squat in a neighboring national park from whence they will in due course also be evicted mpoyi 2010 in ethiopia communities are already being relocated from 10 000 hectares allocated to a saudi ethiopian company with many more relocations anticipated as its lease is extended to 500 000 hectares oakland institute 2011 elsewhere communities are merely dramatically squeezed retaining houses and farms but losing their woodlands and rangelands investors are clearing forests damming rivers and diverting irrigation from smallholders causing wetlands crucial to fishing seasonal fodder production and grazing to dry up and enclosing thousands of hectares of grazing lands for mechanized farming for export all this happens in ethiopia where local food security is already an issue and the specter of famine looms the ethiopian government is meanwhile expanding areas designated for investors to grow oil and food crops for export by 900 000 hectares in another region sometimes villagers tentatively welcome investors in the belief that jobs services education and opportunities will compensate for the loss of traditional lands and livelihoods the reality can be very different villagers in central sierra leone rwanda and kenya are among those not told that canal construction for industrial sugar cane production would dry up their wetlands critical for seasonal rice production fishing reed collection hunting and grazing deng 2011 records the case of a community in south sudan agreeing to hand over 179 000 hectares to a norwegian company for an annual fee of 15 000 and construction of a few boreholes the company aims to make millions on both production and carbon credit deals in such cases traditional leaders and local elites are often facilitators of deals making money on the side at the expense of their communities reports abound of chiefs or local elites in ghana zambia nigeria and mozambique persuading communities of the benefits of releasing their commons to investors and even reinterpreting their trusteeship as entailing their due right to sell and benefit from those sales central government officials politicians and entrepreneurs are routinely on hand to back them up such accounts are repeated throughout africa and in some asian states such as indonesia and malaysian borneo where 20 million hectares have been scheduled for conversion into oil palm plantations colchester 2011 everywhere the story is more or less the same communal rights are being grossly interfered with farming systems upturned livelihoods decimated and water use and environments changed in ways which are dubiously sustainable clearly possession is no more sufficient today than it was for the english villagers of the 17th and 18th centuries of enclosure only legal recognition of commons as the communal property of communities is sufficient to afford real protection a handful of states in africa and somewhat more in latin america have taken this crucial step setting aside fungibility and formal registration as prerequisites to admission as real property the land rush instead not only activates the effects of failing to make such changes a thousandfold it also raises concern that fragile reformist trends will not be sustained governments appear to find leasing out their citizens land too lucrative to themselves and

the international monetary fund imf says the nigerian economy is recovering with increased gross domestic product gdp and falling inflation at the end of 2018 the executive board of the imf stated this in its report at the conclusion of the boardâ s consultation with nigeria according to a statement issued in washington dc by a spokesperson for the fund lucie fouda nan reports imf said â nigeriaâ s economy is recovering â real gdp increased by 1 9 per cent in 2018 up from 0 8 per cent in 2017 on the back of improvements in manufacturing and services supported by spillovers from higher oil prices ongoing convergence in exchange rates and strides to improve the business environment â headline inflation fell to 11 4 per cent at end 2018 reflecting declining food price inflation weak consumer demand a relatively stable exchange rate and tight monetary policy during most of 2018 but remains outside of the central bankâ s target range of 6 9 per cent â record holdings of mostly short term local debt and equity and a current account surplus lifted gross international reserves to a peak in april 2018 while the three times oversubscribed november 2018 eurobond helped cushion the impact of outflows later in the yearâ imf said however persisting structural and policy challenges continue to constrain growth to levels below those needed to reduce vulnerabilities lessen poverty and improve weak human development outcomes such as in health and education the bank said a large infrastructure gap low revenue mobilisation governance and institutional weaknesses continued foreign exchange restrictions and banking sector vulnerabilities were dampening long term foreign and domestic investment and keeping the economy reliant on volatile oil prices and production â under current policies the outlook remains therefore muted over the medium term absent strong reforms growth would hover around 2â½ per cent implying no per capita growth as the economy faces limited increases in oil production and insufficient adjustment four years after the oil price shock â monetary policy focused on exchange rate stability would help contain inflation but worsen competitiveness if greater flexibility is not accommodated when needed high financing costs on the back of little fiscal adjustment would continue to constrain private sector credit and the interest to revenue ratio would remain high â risks are moderately tilted downwards on the upside oil prices could rise prompted by global political disruptions or supply bottlenecks bold reform efforts following the election cycle could boost confidence and investments especially given relatively conservative baseline projections â on the downside additional delays in reform implementation a persistent fall in oil prices reduced oil production increased security tensions or tighter global financial market conditions could undermine growth provoke a market sell off and put additional pressure on reserves and or the exchange rate â the fund said the executive directors in their assessment welcomed nigeriaâ s ongoing economic recovery accompanied by reduced inflation and strengthened reserve buffers they noted however that the medium term outlook remains muted with risks tilted to the downside in addition long standing structural and policy challenges need to be tackled more decisively to reduce vulnerabilities raise per capita growth and bring down poverty they said directors therefore urged the authorities to redouble their reform efforts and supported their intention to accelerate implementation of their economic recovery and growth plan they welcomed the nigerian authoritiesâ tax reform plan to increase non oil revenue including through tax policy and administration measures they stressed the importance of strengthening domestic revenue mobilisation including through additional excises a comprehensive value added tax reform and elimination of tax incentives securing oil revenues through reforms of state owned enterprises and measures to improve the governance of the oil sector will also be crucial they said directors highlighted the importance of shifting the expenditure mix toward priority areas they welcomed in this context the significant increase in public investment but underlined the need for greater investment efficiency while also recommending increasing funding for health and education they noted that phasing out implicit fuel subsidies while strengthening social safety nets to mitigate the impact on the most vulnerable would help reduce the poverty gap and free up additional fiscal space with inflation still above the central bank target directors generally considered that a tight monetary policy stance is appropriate they also urged ending direct central bank intervention in the economy to allow focus on the central bankâ s price stability mandate directors commended the authoritiesâ commitment to unify the exchange rate and welcomed the increasing convergence of foreign exchange windows they noted that a unified market based exchange rate and a more flexible exchange rate regime would support inflation targeting directors also stressed that elimination of exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices would remove distortions and facilitate economic diversification they welcomed the decline in nonperforming loans and the improved prudential banking ratios but noted that restructured loans and undercapitalised banks continue to weigh on financial sector performance directors also recommended establishing a credible time bound recapitalisation plan for weak banks and a timeline for phasing out the state backed asset management company amcon directors urged the authorities to reinvigorate implementation of structural reforms to diversify the economy and achieve the sustainable development goals they pointed to the importance of improving the business environment implementing the power sector recovery programme deepening financial inclusion reforming the health and education sectors and implementing policies to reduce gender inequities directors welcomed improvements in the quality and availability of economic statistics and encouraged continued efforts to address remaining gaps including through regular funding

pilots of an airliner that crashed last month in ethiopia initially followed boeing s emergency steps for dealing with a sudden downturn of the nose of their plane but could not regain control the wall street journal reported wednesday that pilots of the ethiopian airlines boeing 737 max turned off a flight control system but still couldn t get the plane to climb they turned the system back on and tried other actions before the plane crashed the paper said citing people familiar with preliminary findings of the crash investigation in a statement boeing urged against speculating before the preliminary report and flight data from the plane are released the journal says the pilots actions are still being evaluated by investigators but could raise questions about assertions made by boeing and u s regulators in the aftermath of another max crash in october that pilots could regain control simply by following steps to turn off a specific anti stall system investigators are examining the crashes that killed all 346 aboard the 737 max 8 jets operated by indonesia s lion air and ethiopian airlines including the role of a flight control system called mcas which under some circumstances could automatically turn the plane s nose down to prevent an aerodynamic stall the journal reported that data downloaded from the plane s so called black boxes indicates that the ethiopian airlines pilots followed recommendations to flip two switches that disconnected the system but the plane kept sinking they turned a manual wheel that adjusts the plane s tail and used electric switches in an effort to climb but that reactivated mcas which continued to push the plane s nose lower trafficking counterfeit goods trump signs memorandum to stem counterfeit goods trafficking washington ap president donald trump signed a presidential memorandum on wednesday to rein in what the administration calls the wild west of online trafficking in counterfeit goods the memorandum is aimed at stopping the sale of counterfeit products on sites like amazon ebay and china s e commerce leader alibaba peter navarro director of the white house national trade council said the central core of the problem is that right now third party online marketplaces have zero liability when it comes to trafficking in these counterfeit goods that simply has to stop we are going to attack that on numerous fronts but navarro said discussion of possible actions the administration will take to deter online trafficking in counterfeit merchandise is premature he says the directive orders the department of homeland security to work with other agencies on a report identifying the scope of the problem the report also is to identify the origin of the fake goods and recommend administrative regulatory legislative or policy changes to stem the problem the organization for economic cooperation and development estimates that the value of trade in counterfeit and pirated goods is about a half trillion dollars a year with roughly 20 infringing on u s intellectual property according to the directive navarro said a recent government accountability office report examined four categories of frequently counterfeited goods and based on a small sample of these goods purchased through various online third party marketplaces investigators found that more than 40 were counterfeit college admissions

washington d c united states of america april 3 2019 apo group performance in implementing the government s program supported by the imf under the extended credit facility ecf was satisfactory significant progress was made in discussions with the authorities on economic and financial policies that could support completion of the fourth program review after three years of sharp contraction non oil economic activity stabilized in 2018 but the recovery continues to be held back by the domestic debt overhang and underlying structural weaknesses an international monetary fund imf staff mission led by said bakhache visited n djamena from march 18 to april 1 2019 to conduct discussions on the 2019 article iv consultations and the 4th review of the program supported by the extended credit facility ecf arrangement the program was approved by the imf board on june 30 2017 see press release no 17 257 at the end of the mission mr bakhache issued the following statement the chadian authorities and the imf team made significant progress in discussions on the policies and reforms needed for the completion of the fourth review of the ecf supported program discussions will continue in washington dc during the upcoming imf world bank spring meetings after three consecutive years of contraction non oil economic activity has stabilized and pressures on the government fiscal position have eased nonetheless the social economic and financial situation remains fragile while oil production rebounded strongly in 2018 growth in the non oil sector was estimated at only 0 5 percent economic recovery continues to be held back by the domestic debt overhang and underlying structural fragilities average inflation picked up to 4 percent in 2018 pulled largely by a 90 percent increase in the administered price of fresh water in may 2018 fiscal developments in 2018 were marked by spending discipline with the wage bill contained within the budget envelop while other domestically financed expenditures were in line with the program social spending was lower than expected non oil revenue declined in 2018 relative to 2017 as performance weakened during the second half of the year oil revenue increased significantly in 2018 reflecting higher oil production and prices all quantitative performance criteria for end december 2018 under chad s economic and financial program were observed however the indicative targets on social spending and the regularization of emergency spending procedures dao were not observed implementation of agreed structural reforms is underway but some have experienced delays the audit of domestic arrears experienced long delays while the work on the removal of exemptions was partially done the work of the consultants on the review and reorganization of the two large public banks is expected to be finalized soon looking forward the outlook for growth is underpinned by an increase in oil production and sustained reform efforts to support the recovery in the non oil sector despite lower oil prices the increase in oil production is expected to boost overall gdp growth however the recovery in the non oil sector hinges on significant progress in the clearance of domestic arrears addressing vulnerabilities in the banking sector and strong reforms to improve governance continued fiscal prudence is necessary to maintain the recent hard won stabilization fiscal policy in 2019 is expected to lead to an increase in spending including for social sectors acceleration in domestic arrears clearance and higher repayment of domestic debt these policies are expected to help ease pressures on the banking sector support the economic recovery and help improve social conditions the effect of lower oil prices is expected to be offset by higher oil tax revenue as the largest oil producer is expected to start paying corporate income taxes and lower debt service to glencore in line with the agreement reached last year the mission agreed with the authorities that in case overall oil revenues fall short of expectation a revised budget would be necessary efforts to improve non oil revenue mobilization should be enhanced to make up for the shortfall in 2018 in addition policies will continue to focus on improving expenditure management article iv discussions focused on policies to deal with legacies of the crisis that began in 2014 and long standing structural weaknesses addressing these issues would create the much needed space for higher public spending and the necessary environment for an active private sector improving governance across all sectors of the economy is a critical element of the reform efforts the mission shared policy recommendations to i build fiscal resilience by raising non oil revenues and reducing arrears while raising social spending ii foster sustainable and inclusive growth and iii strengthen the ability of the banking sector to effectively contribute to private sector growth reforms should aim to increase non oil revenue while more actively and transparently planning and managing oil revenues this will help create better space for a gradual increase in spending on social sectors and infrastructure investment over the medium term equally important is the improvement in public financial management including to improve the quality of spending in these sectors to help achieve the sustainable development goals the mission emphasized the importance of loosening the inter dependence between the banking sector and the government the mission met with the minister of finance and budget mr allali mahamat abakar other senior government officials and the national director of beac the staff also met with members of the national assembly representatives of civil

by john davi astoria portfolio advisors key highlights markets experienced a global growth slowdown not a recession market pundits have been warning about a flattening yield curve and a potential recession for most of the 1 st quarter had you listened to those pundits you would have missed out on one of the best quarters since the great financial crisis global growth slowdown likely to trough in the first half maintain a globally diversified multi factor and multi asset etf portfolio executive summary we suggested in our 4 th quarter commentary that volatility would remain high in 2019 unless there was a material improvement in trade negotiations the u s federal reserve became more accommodative or global economic data improved two of these three risk factors materially improved in the 1 st quarter which resulted in a strong rally in equities globally quarter commentary that unless there was a material improvement in trade negotiations the u s federal reserve became more accommodative or global economic data improved two of these three risk factors in the 1 quarter which resulted in a globally furthermore we wrote that the u s federal reserve needed to be more accommodative with not only their interest rate policy but also with their balance sheet unwind in order to ensure stability in the financial system essentially this is what the federal reserve announced at its march fomc meeting with not only their interest rate policy but also with their balance sheet unwind in order to ensure stability in the financial system essentially this is what the federal reserve announced at its march fomc meeting the s p 500 index increased by 13 65 in the 1st quarter which was its best quarterly return since 2009 from december 24 2018 through march 29 2019 the s p 500 index is up a remarkable 21 22 u s federal reserve the u s federal reserve chairman jerome powell kept the federal funds target range unchanged at 2 25 2 50 at the march fomc meeting moreover the federal reserve indicated no plans for interest rate hikes in 2019 and provided a more accommodative policy path over the next couple of years the federal reserve plans to wind down its balance sheet normalization beginning in may 2019 with the program concluding at the end of september 2019 at 2 25 2 50 at the march fomc meeting moreover the federal reserve indicated and provided a

in 2020 and 2021 yield curve the inversion of the u s yield curve is a topic that the financial media has discussed quite a bit lately specifically the 3 month treasury bill vs 10 year treasury bond yield curve turned negative for the first time since 2006 see chart below source bloomberg astoria portfolio advisors however not all parts of the u s interest rate yield curve have inverted for instance the 2s10s spread remains positive at 14bps as of march 29 2019 see chart below in fact the 2s10s spread has historically been more regarded for recession concerns source bloomberg astoria portfolio advisors according to j p morgan research 7 out of the 8 u s yield curve inversions since 1960 were followed by a recession however contrary to the negative concerns of an inversion by the financial media equites historically have produced strong returns in the quarters following an inversion moreover according to j p morgan research the number of months between the 2s10s inversion and the subsequent recession has increased 17 months for the prior 3 inversions compared to the prior four instances 9 months moreover j p morgan s research group notes that there was a 22 month lag between the time the yield curve inverted in 2008 and the subsequent recession the bottom line from astoria portfolio advisors is that portfolios should certainly be rebalanced to prepare for a late cycle environment but investors shouldn t panic over recession fears just yet out of the u s yield curve inversions were followed by a recession however contrary to the negative concerns of an inversion by the financial media equites historically have produced strong returns in the quarters following an inversion moreover according to j p morgan research the number of months between the

source bloomberg we do not think rising inflation is a major risk for the economy we are closely monitoring the new york federal reserve underlying inflation gauge index which has steadily declined since june 2018 see chart below source federal reserve bank of ny bloomberg astoria portfolio advisors we have written that gold was attractive in a multi asset portfolio as it serves as a valuable diversifier during times of stress as a reminder our gold allocation helped soften our portfolio volatility in the 4th quarter as gold rose 7 53 while the s p 500 index declined 13 52 as highlighted above gold was up marginally in the 1st quarter showing that its low correlation to stocks still exists alternatives and market timing in 2018 our view was that liquidity would decline due to higher u s interest rates and the u s federal reserve implementing their quantitative tightening program we repeatedly wrote that a continuation of trade protectionism polices could further increase the probability of a full blown trade war leading to a decline in stocks for these reasons we included alternatives across all our etf portfolios in 2018 due to higher u s interest rates and the u s federal reserve implementing their quantitative tightening program we repeatedly wrote that a continuation of trade protectionism polices could further increase the probability of a full blown trade war leading to a decline in stocks for these reasons we included alternatives across all our etf portfolios in 2018 however higher interest rates and a full blown trade war are less of a risk factor at this juncture so we have reduced some of our alternatives exposure in our strategic etf portfolios we are primarily utilizing bonds and cash to dampen our portfolio volatility during stressed markets in our strategic portfolios however our multi asset risk strategy mars etf portfolio still maintains a healthy allocation towards alternatives so we have reduced some of our alternatives exposure in our strategic etf portfolios we are primarily utilizing bonds and cash to in our strategic portfolios however our etf portfolio still maintains a healthy allocation towards alternatives our view has been that timing the market top and bottom is extremely difficult and that investors are incentivized to stay fully invested in strategic asset allocation portfolios the last two quarters proved our point the s p 500 index declined 52 in the 4th quarter and rallied 13 65 in the 1st quarter of 2019 we continue to advocate not only to stay fully invested but to maintain a globally

this article is more than 5 years old getty with 9 days remaining theresa may has been handling an impossible situation supporters and foes of brexit are all furiously attacking and defending their various positions while the uk parliament attempt to organize a coherent response to the self made situation that they are in even a very talented flowchart maker jon worth can scarcely keep up with the decision trees if a no deal brexit goes through i predict that the uk will find themselves in a hyper inflationary market with many companies including airbus threatening to leave the uk in totality every economic indicator will likely flash red on that day unemployment will rise the already strained uk central bank will be forced to print cash and bitcoin will rise against the pound largely absent from the analysis is the impact that brexit would have on the eu the uk ranks 5 in terms of world economies even as eu parliamentarians such as mep richard ashworth bemoans the 20 year campaign of untruths by british press that led to today s crisis and implores others to fight to maintain the level of peace and prosperity that exists there exists little debate on the impact to the eu as an example a large portion of germany s rank 4 in terms of gdp economic engine relies upon products and services from the uk all of this would be impacted by brexit as new costs would be introduced that would adversely impact profit margins it is very likely that the long term impact of a no deal brexit on germany would be one of lower gdp and higher economic volatility this means that it is very likely that the bitcoin will rise against the euro amid this is a larger discussion surrounding sovereignty as donald trump so ineloquently likes to say make great again brexit came about as a response to perceived problems infringing on the idea of propriety and sovereignty with articles printed by the sun exclaiming eu to stop binge drinking it is little wonder that the misinformed public expressed their national pride in a way that will adversely affect their prosperity similarly bitcoin and other cryptocurrency maximalists tend to single mindedly support their coins and their ideology to the exclusion of all others many of the supporters of bitcoin are focused purely on the price of the currency pair for example bitcoin recently crossed the 5 000 usd mark in a gain of 15 in one day immediately matt novak with gizmodo reacted with an article that blatantly attacks bitcoin supporters supporters like tim pool immediately responded tearing apart the insanity of matt novak s trashy piece of journalism even as many supporters are cheering the rise of the currency pair to their coins these same supporters tend to fight other cryptocurrencies successes as well discussions on forums and social sites such as reddit tend to exclude the work done by other cryptocurrencies for example vitalik buterin recently has been working on a major upgrade to the ethereum system and bitcoin supporters have largely panned anything to do with him similarly when exchanges suffers hacks bitcoin supporters typically blame the victims for not having their coins on some kind of hardware wallet this idea about sovereignty has really pervaded our collective consciousness and is adversely affecting the growth of ideas the idea that we should each be our own self contained island of everything is quite silly and impossible to execute we need other people and we need interdependence while this price thing fluctuates and plays out the larger moves by the economies are still playing out in seeming slow motion brexit is looming large and behind that is a very likely second shoe dropping from the us economy even as banks plan to lend again to people that can t afford it and health care costs continue to skyrocket beyond the realm of sanity retail jobs are disappearing as retailers go bankrupt the us stock market continues to post positive gains and with that donald trump declares that america is great to get an idea as to how bitcoin would do in a global recessionary environment we can look to venezuela recent currency demise and their country s handling of the situation the venezuelan government attempted to launch their own oil backed cryptocurrency and failed they tried to ban cryptocurrency mining and likely did not succeed as russia and the us fights over the future of the country its citizens are using cryptocurrency just to survive with a million percent inflation rate citizens of venezuela would look to anything to help them through the crisis many chose cryptocurrencies like dash bitcoin and others just to buy milk they all said converting the bitcoin to bolivars was the easiest part of the process the harder part was finding the milk to buy many shops have gone bare 2019 bloomberg finance lp even as the us dollar price of bitcoin has fluctuated from 20 000 to 3 000 over the prior year this is still far less volatility than the venezuelan bolivar the value of the technology has created an inherent value in the currency the technology has enabled a secure means of storage and retrieval of a currency using purely digital and proven mathematical means this has supported the value of the currency to individuals experiencing a hardship with their own currency as the united kingdom europe and possibly the rest of the world heads into an uncertain economic future i suspect that we will see a similar situation play out if no deal brexit goes through we will likely see the first wave of a recession hit the united kingdom with the uk central bank unable to maintain economic controls many of those citizens will seek a safe refuge for their economic holdings bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies communities should look past the issues of sovereignty and to create a community surrounding the currencies to facilitate transactions rather than supporting only one cryptocurrency to the exclusion of all others every cryptocurrency should support a global ecosystem that enables its users to get past the issues with today s fiat based systems much in the same way that the internet was built by global standards cryptocurrencies should support global standards that facilitates the users demands bitcoin s rise will continue regardless of fake news recessionary fears and censorship it has already won the trust of millions of early adopters and use cases are popping up everywhere rather than fearing for the fiat these fiat maximalists should find their own cryptocurrency use case be

ndubuisi francis the african development bank afdb has observed that the fragile security conditions in the northern part of nigeria mali and niger republic constitute major risks for economic prospects in the west africa sub region between 2019 and 2020 the bank also noted that although the transition to monetary union and the adoption of the economic community of west african states ecowas single currency in 2020 remains laudable the asymmetries in macroeconomic conditions and differences in economic progress and rates of convergence to macroeconomic targets pose formidable challenges that would make it impossible to be realised these revelations were made in abuja tuesday at the launch of the 2019 african economic outlook and west africa regional economic outlook according to the report west africa s 15 economies are diverse across many dimensions of development adding that in 2018 income capita ranged from 452 in niger to 3 678 in cape verde nine countries reportedly witnessed a growth of at least 5 0 per cent in 2017 and 2018 it said noting that five have been growing at that rate since 2014 2016 according to the report while growth in those countries has been driven by agriculture the service sector has emerged to complement agriculture it stated that historically higher prices for the region s commodities have bolstered growth pointing out that a sustained recovery in prices conditioned on strong global demand could improve growth and macroeconomic conditions in the short to medium term however it alluded to major risks for the region s economic prospects in 2019 2 1 to include the fragile security conditions in northern nigeria mali and niger republic the report also observed that among macroeconomic indicators inflation fueled in part by expansionary fiscal policy and supply side constraints remain a challenge to investment and sustainable economic growth in west africa in his address the afdb president dr akinwunmi adesina who was represented at the launch by the bank s senior director in nigeria mr ebrima faal observed that nigeria s recovery from economic recession will provide positive spillovers for west africa s regional growth over the short to medium terms according to him after nigeria s 2016 economic rescission and the much improved growth rate of 1 9 per cent in 2018 the economies of countries like cote d ivoire made faster growth with a gdp of 7 4 per cent while senegal posted seven per cent gdp he expressed optimism that with the successful conduct of the 2019 general elections and the government s commitment to the implementation of the economic recovery and growth plan ergp the future looks brighter for the region i believe in the popular saying that if nigeria sneezes other countries in the region will catch a cold with the expectation that foreign capital flows will increase post election and oil prices and production are favourable optimism for macroeconomic progress and stability in nigeria is strong and this growth trajectory should be sustained west africa recorded 3 3 per cent gdp in 2018 while the regional growth is projected to average about 3 6 per cent in 2019 and 2020 based on gradual recovery of commodity prices especially gold cocoa and cashew nut he said adesina stated that countries belonging to the west africa economic and monetary union waemu enjoy relatively low levels of inflation mainly owing to the peg of their currency to euro which limits the transmission of global shocks evident during the 2016 economic recession he added that even last year s much improved growth rate of 1 9 per cent masks faster growth in some economies in the region such as cote d ivoire 7 4 per cent and senegal 7 per cent the good news is that nigeria has recovered from the last recession this will have positive spillovers for the region s growth trajectory over the short to medium term with the successful conduct of the 2019 general elections and the government s commitment to the implementation of the economic recovery and growth plan the future ks bright for the region in addition with the expectation that foreign capital inflows will increase post election and oil prices and production are favourable optimism for macroeconomic progress and stability in nnigteria is strong this growth trajectory should be sustained the afdb president advised however he noted that the issue of external debt is back on the radar in many west african countries adding that average external debt is rising and has nearly doubled over the past six years to 23 6 per cent of gdp at the end of february 2019 compared with 13 5 per cent in 2013 this has increased the burden of serving external debt the delicate security bsituation in some parts of the region also continue to impede economic performance and social stability in west africa region he said adesina also stated that migration was another concern fundamentally driven by rising youth unemployment stressing that it was important for us to know and understand these challenges because theses issues need to be present in the dialogue we engage with our regional member countries and factored in when designing development projects and programmes he pointed out that there were significant structural and externally induced downside risks to the growth forecast of the region in 2019 adding that the unresolved trade tensions between the united states of america and china the middle east crisis and the recurring sanctions on iran the uncertainties surrounding brexit as well as they predicted slowdowns in major european economies like germany and france pose threats to the west african region these could affect trade and fiscal balances for africa s net commodity exporters while further weaken the already dwindling foreign capital inflows to africa remittances could also shrink he said

article jim miles much of current political news swirls around president trump and his persistent and somewhat pathological prevarications about the mexico u s border and the need to build a border wall while greg grandins the end of the myth leads up to this review by jim miles the end of the myth from the frontier to the border wall in the mind of america greg grandin metropolitan books henry holt co new york 2019 much of current political news swirls around president trump and his persistent and somewhat pathological prevarications about the mexico u s border and the need to build a border wall while greg grandin s the end of the myth leads up to this current preoccupation it goes well beyond it surveying the whole of the empire and its history to reveal the foundational myth of the u s empire and it is done superbly this is a wonderful work of history drawing the reader in through anecdotal stories and comments combined with a strong factual research background grandin s style of writing avoids the pitfalls of a dry history creating a theme and a storyline that consistently exposes the creation reworking and alterations to the imperial myth as it crosses time and place the frontier in a single word the myth is that of frontier it is one word that carries cartloads of baggage and contains many other subordinate but necessary mythical structures that support and extend the idea the idea of frontier necessitates the idea of boundaries and borders as the frontier moves so do the boundaries mythological psychological as well as physical it carries along with it the whole mythology most frequently recognized in our modern era with ronald reagan ayn rand clint eastwood margaret thatcher and others of their ilk as rugged individualism and individual liberty unconstrained by governments and rules of society another important associated idea is that of a safety valve this idea was recognized early by the political leaders of the day and still in use today where the frontier served as a release for antagonisms created by the massive influx of immigrants into the already crowded and frequently poverty laden regions of the burgeoning east coast cities as well as antagonisms aimed more directly at their own lies and misdeeds superimposed on it all is racism this invokes more than the racism of slave labour more than the racism of indian removal then military slaughter more than the racism of incoming migrants from many different homelands more than the racism concerning religion and nationalities it is a synergy of them all into a white anglo saxon supremacist ideal where the other really does not matter extending from the rugged individual to corporate internationalism and then yes the wall features of the frontier the frontier and its myths are explored through history of actions and ideas combined it is a fixed physical construct with forts rivers trails and transportation routes and maps to identify them but it was also a blurry indistinct place where white settlers fled to escape routinization a place that goes on forever it is a multistoried affair where the royal proclamation of 1763 the indian removal act of 1830 and the conflicts with slavery and abolition pushed the boundaries of the frontier into mexican territory and the invasion of 1846 all these wars came to be both valve and throttle with each conflict simultaneously venting the hatreds produced by the last while creating the conditions for the next and as war begets war a state born out of ceaseless expansion could only be maintained through ceaseless expansion 1898 marks a redefinition of the frontier the frontier reached a physical limit in north america and by necessity expanded overseas creating an american history fast turning into an endless public parade of war and more war overseas war had the effect of unifying the country this time not some sections against others but the whole nation the military became the primary means of social mobility allowing both whites and blacks shelter from the capitalist market grandin s history continues through the roosevelt era and into the new deal pre war era after the second world war the frontier was rejuvenated as a future that might be obtained it involved a u s security frontier already established in the western hemisphere now expanded to a global position a major part of that was linking the cold war and its anti communism to a new politics of expansion in particular the global economy as a new frontier globalization in all its manifestations this expanded with reagan with his promises of freedom from restraint with no limits to growth individual and economic rights markets overpowered human and social rights the violence and racism ongoing along the mexican border was redirected to cold war counter insurgencies leading to many more immigrants the u s was still a beacon a magnet for all the pilgrims from all the lost places reagan s successor gwh bush expanded on the frontier idea in the frontiers ahead there are no boundaries nafta one of the big surprises in the book and if i had thought about it carefully should not have been was the emphasis grandin placed on the north american free trade agreement even before the agreement was enacted there were already 1925 work plants in mexico taking advantage of the low wage labour and the lack of labour and environmental regulations with the huge increase in interest rates in 1980 to an average of seventeen per cent many u s businesses and farmers lost their livelihoods those same interest rates created a huge debt repayment problem in mexico leading to the imf shock doctrine of austerity privatization cut spending lax foreign investment controls weaken labour laws and stop land reform in short even before nafta mexico had succumbed to u s economic expansion and control nafta affected the poor farmers as subsidized u s corn dairy and pork killed their subsistence living they were forced into cheap wage labour for u s corporations into drug trafficking and into the urban sprawl of mexico city the corporations had their new frontier the blowback to this was increased immigration and the rapid rise in border patrol actions the border patrol was a frontline instrument of white supremacist power the u s became a country that increasingly defines itself by what it hates a decade of free trade neither created an international community of prosperous peace loving nations nor overcome domestic political divisions with the administration of george bush the 9 11 attack offered a chance to turn away from the border and look out at the world anew now clarifying the mission as we will extend the frontiers of freedom turning inwards but as with the vietnam war and the many other smaller counterinsurgencies foreign wars produce domestic disruption as the struggle turns inwards the backlashes to decades of disastrous policies piled up one after the other until the backlash to the backlashes came trump the mexican border wall fits into the underlying racism of u s culture it is a valve that needs to be turned off or on as convenient for political purposes it is also a valve for the many war vets to release their frustrations against a targeted other along with the veterans it allows many others to practice their rugged individualism as vigilantes along the border expressing their racist white supremacism against groups of aliens created in the most part by u s imperial actions trump s new freedom is freedom from constraint his cruelty and hedonism giving permission to many others to accept those actions and also to practice them still more frontiers while grandin focuses on the image of the mexican border wall as a sign of the closure of the frontier he does not delve into contemporary u s military actions around the world the imperial frontier is faltering in many respects as events in ukraine and syria and the failure of past actions in iraq afghanistan and libya have well demonstrated but it is still there perhaps more as bluster and rhetoric as witnessed with venezuela than a true frontier a rhetorical ideological rant to redirect domestic concerns and attempt to somehow keep the empire alive and its frontiers still an active zone the strength of the end of the myth is that it does not take any imagination to extend the myth into other areas of u s foreign policy grandin has explored the myth very effectively highlighting the idea of frontier as it changed over time leaving us with trump as the ultimate characterization of the state of the union at this point in time a fascinating work it defines the psychological mythical constructs of the u s imperial mind very well ends content sourced from scoop co nz original url

by simon black my grandfather was just a toddler when soldiers came home from world war one in 1918 they brought the deadly spanish flu with them which killed well over 50 million worldwide as a young adult my grandfather struggled through the great depression with the rest of the world and just as things started looking up world war ii broke out lucky for me he survived it all after the war my grandfather took a job as a teacher and on that single salary he was able to buy a house provide for his family afford a car and have a secure pension for when he retired his wife my grandmother started a small hair salon in the family living room to earn money on the side they saved nearly every penny they ever earned they never went into debt and they invested conservatively often buying short term government savings bonds that paid over 4 by the late 1950s well above the rate of inflation this wasn t just my grandparents experience either back then this was the fundamental promise of america you were rewarded for working hard and saving money but now things are entirely different for starters cost of living is totally out of control my grandfather s teaching salary was more than enough to support his family in a comfortable middle class lifestyle today that would be almost impossible more often than not it takes two working parents to make ends meet in a typical household census statistics show that just 25 of married households with children were dual income in 1950 today it s nearly 70 plus to even qualify for a lot of jobs today you must have a university degree which carries its own enormous costs even after adjusting for inflation a typical university education in the us costs over five times as much as it did in 1960 according to the national center for education statistics a typical young person today emerges from university with student debt exceeding 40 000 and millions of young people have student debt exceeding 100 000 speaking of debt my grandparents had none and they had plenty of cash savings as was typical of their generation but today s median household according to federal reserve data has racked up consumer debt exceeding 30 000 with a bank balance of less than 5 000 and that bank balance earns a pitiful interest rate of just 0 02 so even for people who have savings the interest they earn doesn t keep up with inflation housing costs are also out of control home prices are near record highs making it extremely difficult for young people to afford a down payment and rents have been steadily rising for years far outpacing the rate of inflation and lackluster wage increases perhaps that s why a survey from zillow last year found that nearly 25 of 24 36 year olds were living with their parents they simply can t afford their own housing coincidentally a study from the university of chicago last year showed that roughly 25 of people in their 20s reported having zero sex in the previous 12 months almost the same amount as people living with mom and dad we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us while this might sound comical it matters young people are putting off children as well in fact the us fertility rate is now at its lowest level in decades well below the amount necessary to maintain a stable population it s simply too expensive to have kids when my grandparents started having children the hospital bill was about 100 today it can easily be more than 100x that amount and the cost of rearing a child today through the age of 18 can now exceed 200 000 not including university tuition then there are retirement challenges as well back in my grandparents era it was common for workers to have well funded private pensions today private pensions are nearly extinct and of the few that still exist about 25 are insolvent public pensions as we discuss frequently are in terrible condition with a mutli trillion dollar funding gap worldwide and then there s social security which is in such financial ruin that even the social security administration admits the program s trust funds will run out of money in 2034 i also think back to how easily my grandmother was able to start her own hair salon she bought a pair of scissors one day and started cutting hair in her living room simple today you d have to navigate a mountain of permits licenses bureaucracy and legal liability the cost of which is prohibitive for most people who dream about starting their own business unsurprisingly census data show that the number of new startups in the us continues to decline this is a long way from the original promise of america where the average person could work hard save money and afford to retire today the system is no longer designed to provide any of that wages and savings don t keep pace with inflation debt has exploded people are working harder and becoming less prosperous and retirement is anything but secure these problems can t be fixed in a voting booth or by waiting for the bolsheviks to engineer prosperity for all and certainly not by following the status quo a better solution is to walk a different path altogether one of self reliance and independence for example you can secure your retirement not by relying on a broken pension but by taking matters into your own hands with a more robust structure like a solo 401 k you can obtain a top quality university education by studying abroad at a fraction of the price you can start a new business in a tax advantaged jurisdiction like puerto rico where you can pay just 4 tax on your profits there are countless solutions to fix these challenges it just takes a little bit of education and the will to take action

review the end of the myth review by jim miles the end of the myth from the frontier to the border wall in the mind of america greg grandin metropolitan books henry holt co new york 2019 much of current political news swirls around president trump and his persistent and somewhat pathological prevarications about the mexico u s border and the need to build a border wall while greg grandin s the end of the myth leads up to this current preoccupation it goes well beyond it surveying the whole of the empire and its history to reveal the foundational myth of the u s empire and it is done superbly this is a wonderful work of history drawing the reader in through anecdotal stories and comments combined with a strong factual research background grandin s style of writing avoids the pitfalls of a dry history creating a theme and a storyline that consistently exposes the creation reworking and alterations to the imperial myth as it crosses time and place the frontier in a single word the myth is that of frontier it is one word that carries cartloads of baggage and contains many other subordinate but necessary mythical structures that support and extend the idea the idea of frontier necessitates the idea of boundaries and borders as the frontier moves so do the boundaries mythological psychological as well as physical it carries along with it the whole mythology most frequently recognized in our modern era with ronald reagan ayn rand clint eastwood margaret thatcher and others of their ilk as rugged individualism and individual liberty unconstrained by governments and rules of society advertisement scroll to continue reading another important associated idea is that of a safety valve this idea was recognized early by the political leaders of the day and still in use today where the frontier served as a release for antagonisms created by the massive influx of immigrants into the already crowded and frequently poverty laden regions of the burgeoning east coast cities as well as antagonisms aimed more directly at their own lies and misdeeds superimposed on it all is racism this invokes more than the racism of slave labour more than the racism of indian removal then military slaughter more than the racism of incoming migrants from many different homelands more than the racism concerning religion and nationalities it is a synergy of them all into a white anglo saxon supremacist ideal where the other really does not matter extending from the rugged individual to corporate internationalism and then yes the wall features of the frontier the frontier and its myths are explored through history of actions and ideas combined it is a fixed physical construct with forts rivers trails and transportation routes and maps to identify them but it was also a blurry indistinct place where white settlers fled to escape routinization a place that goes on forever it is a multistoried affair where the royal proclamation of 1763 the indian removal act of 1830 and the conflicts with slavery and abolition pushed the boundaries of the frontier into mexican territory and the invasion of 1846 all these wars came to be both valve and throttle with each conflict simultaneously venting the hatreds produced by the last while creating the conditions for the next and as war begets war a state born out of ceaseless expansion could only be maintained through ceaseless expansion 1898 marks a redefinition of the frontier the frontier reached a physical limit in north america and by necessity expanded overseas creating an american history fast turning into an endless public parade of war and more war overseas war had the effect of unifying the country this time not some sections against others but the whole nation the military became the primary means of social mobility allowing both whites and blacks shelter from the capitalist market grandin s history continues through the roosevelt era and into the new deal pre war era after the second world war the frontier was rejuvenated as a future that might be obtained it involved a u s security frontier already established in the western hemisphere now expanded to a global position a major part of that was linking the cold war and its anti communism to a new politics of expansion in particular the global economy as a new frontier globalization in all its manifestations this expanded with reagan with his promises of freedom from restraint with no limits to growth individual and economic rights markets overpowered human and social rights the violence and racism ongoing along the mexican border was redirected to cold war counter insurgencies leading to many more immigrants the u s was still a beacon a magnet for all the pilgrims from all the lost places reagan s successor gwh bush expanded on the frontier idea in the frontiers ahead there are no boundaries nafta one of the big surprises in the book and if i had thought about it carefully should not have been was the emphasis grandin placed on the north american free trade agreement even before the agreement was enacted there were already 1925 work plants in mexico taking advantage of the low wage labour and the lack of labour and environmental regulations with the huge increase in interest rates in 1980 to an average of seventeen per cent many u s businesses and farmers lost their livelihoods those same interest rates created a huge debt repayment problem in mexico leading to the imf shock doctrine of austerity privatization cut spending lax foreign investment controls weaken labour laws and stop land reform in short even before nafta mexico had succumbed to u s economic expansion and control nafta affected the poor farmers as subsidized u s corn dairy and pork killed their subsistence living they were forced into cheap wage labour for u s corporations into drug trafficking and into the urban sprawl of mexico city the corporations had their new frontier the blowback to this was increased immigration and the rapid rise in border patrol actions the border patrol was a frontline instrument of white supremacist power the u s became a country that increasingly defines itself by what it hates a decade of free trade neither created an international community of prosperous peace loving nations nor overcome domestic political divisions with the administration of george bush the 9 11 attack offered a chance to turn away from the border and look out at the world anew now clarifying the mission as we will extend the frontiers of freedom turning inwards but as with the vietnam war and the many other smaller counterinsurgencies foreign wars produce domestic disruption as the struggle turns inwards the backlashes to decades of disastrous policies piled up one after the other until the backlash to the backlashes came trump the mexican border wall fits into the underlying racism of u s culture it is a valve that needs to be turned off or on as convenient for political purposes it is also a valve for the many war vets to release their frustrations against a targeted other along with the veterans it allows many others to practice their rugged individualism as vigilantes along the border expressing their racist white supremacism against groups of aliens created in the most part by u s imperial actions trump s new freedom is freedom from constraint his cruelty and hedonism giving permission to many others to accept those actions and also to practice them still more frontiers while grandin focuses on the image of the mexican border wall as a sign of the closure of the frontier he does not delve into contemporary u s military actions around the world the imperial frontier is faltering in many respects as events in ukraine and syria and the failure of past actions in iraq afghanistan and libya have well demonstrated but it is still there perhaps more as bluster and rhetoric as witnessed with venezuela than a true frontier a rhetorical ideological rant to redirect domestic concerns and attempt to somehow keep the empire alive and its frontiers still an active zone the strength of the end of the myth is that it does not take any imagination to extend the myth into other areas of u s foreign policy grandin has explored the myth very effectively highlighting the idea of frontier as it changed over time leaving us with trump as the ultimate characterization of the state of the union at this point in time a fascinating work it defines the psychological mythical constructs of the u s imperial mind very well ends scoop media

investors fled equity markets in late 2018 in fear that rising interest rates and inflation pressures would threaten stock valuations and profit margins this year markets have recovered strongly after the federal reserve and the bank of canada in part as a recognition of market volatility backed off on their intentions to tighten monetary policy the s p tsx composite and s p 500 have almost recovered all of the lost ground from their respective 2018 peaks with central banks in a cautious wait and see position for the foreseeable future so what s next for investors with markets seemingly in search of direction i m following five charts shown here to identify the future direction for stock prices while the charts may seem u s centric they are still highly relevant for the canadian investor the s p tsx composite has been closely following the s p 500 recently and global economic data have been affecting both indexes to roughly the same degree chart 1 if i could only pick one chart to highlight the main drivers of market volatility over the past six months and where stocks may head in the future it would be the comparison of the s p 500 and the goldman sachs u s financial conditions index developed by high profile goldman sachs economist jan hatzius the financial conditions index uses bond yields corporate bond spreads central bank rates and the trade weighted u s dollar to measure the availability of credit for corporations from mid 2018 u s equities have moved almost exactly in accordance to credit conditions falling as credit became more expensive and climbing as corporate borrowing became steadily cheaper in 2019 note that the financial conditions index is inverted to better show the trend changes in financial conditions will no doubt continue to have influence over stock prices in the near term chart 2 the yield curve has received a ton of attention both domestically and south of the border as a possible signal of approaching recession the yield curve s proven ability to predict the cboe volatility index vix however is more important for investors than the economic implications in my opinion merrill lynch quantitative strategist savita subramanian uses the yield curve as an indicator of market volatility with a 36 month lag the current shape of the yield curve will affect the vix three years from now the future course of the vix the light blue line can be expected to track the existing purple line on the chart which means the relationship currently points to a sustained multiyear increase in volatility rising volatility is usually associated with down markets chart 3 the year to date rally in equity markets has been accompanied by a steady reduction in corporate profit forecasts the coming u s earnings season is expected to produce the first year over year decline in profits since 2016 a negative result represents a drastic slowdown from previous growth levels and expectations for the second quarter while positive aren t that much better the combination of higher stock prices and lower earnings is an unlikely pairing and also unsustainable first quarter earnings results will be even more important to global markets than usual profits below expectations and further reductions in earnings estimates for 2019 would have very negative effects on stock prices chart 4 the financial times senior investment commentator michael mackenzie is using the u s yield curve specifically the difference between the 30 year treasury yield and 10 year treasury yield to gauge the market s faith in the outlook for the u s economy when the 30 year yield climbs relative to the 10 year this causes the line on this chart to slope upward and implies that global investors believe in continued u s growth and that a recession is postponed u s growth is of course vital for canadian exporters and the domestic economy s dependence on exports will likely increase as indebted households rein in consumption chart 5 the difference between canadian and u s short term bond yields has been the most important determinant of the value of the loonie even more so than crude prices two year yields are a reflection of central bank interest rate policy expectations so this chart underscores the importance of the fed and the boc in deciding the value of the canadian dollar taken together the five charts remind us that positive market returns in the next few months are dependent on inflection points from negative to positive in either the corporate profit outlook or the global economy i m not convinced that market prices currently reflect a year over year decline in first quarter u s profits investors can expect some intense selling pressure if analyst forecasts are correct u s economic growth at least for now appears resilient economists estimate domestic product growth of 2 4 per cent for 2019 which is significantly above the 1 5 per cent expansion predicted for the canadian economy on wednesday however weaker than expected data on u s services industry activity underscored the impression that america s growth rate is decelerating according to cibc economist avery shenfeld it does seem that with central banks on hold markets are now at a pivotal point either corporate and economic data stabilize and pave the way for another leg up in stock prices or volatility hits and markets reprice to reflect deteriorating fundamentals these five charts should help investors determine which way we re headed scott barlow globe investor s in house market strategist writes

the end of the myth from the frontier to the border wall in the mind of america greg grandin metropolitan books henry holt co new york 2019 much of current political news swirls around president trump and his persistent and somewhat pathological prevarications about the mexico u s border and the need to build a border wall while greg grandin s the end of the myth leads up to this current preoccupation it goes well beyond it surveying the whole of the empire and its history to reveal the foundational myth of the u s empire and it is done superbly this is a wonderful work of history drawing the reader in through anecdotal stories and comments combined with a strong factual research background grandin s style of writing avoids the pitfalls of a dry history creating a theme and a storyline that consistently exposes the creation reworking and alterations to the imperial myth as it crosses time and place the frontier in a single word the myth is that of frontier it is one word that carries cartloads of baggage and contains many other subordinate but necessary mythical structures that support and extend the idea the idea of frontier necessitates the idea of boundaries and borders as the frontier moves so do the boundaries mythological psychological as well as physical it carries along with it the whole mythology most frequently recognized in our modern era with ronald reagan ayn rand clint eastwood margaret thatcher and others of their ilk as rugged individualism and individual liberty unconstrained by governments and rules of society another important associated idea is that of a safety valve this idea was recognized early by the political leaders of the day and still in use today where the frontier served as a release for antagonisms created by the massive influx of immigrants into the already crowded and frequently poverty laden regions of the burgeoning east coast cities as well as antagonisms aimed more directly at their own lies and misdeeds superimposed on it all is racism this invokes more than the racism of slave labour more than the racism of indian removal then military slaughter more than the racism of incoming migrants from many different homelands more than the racism concerning religion and nationalities it is a synergy of them all into a white anglo saxon supremacist ideal where the other really does not matter extending from the rugged individual to corporate internationalism and then yes the wall features of the frontier the frontier and its myths are explored through history of actions and ideas combined it is a fixed physical construct with forts rivers trails and transportation routes and maps to identify them but it was also a blurry indistinct place where white settlers fled to escape routinization a place that goes on forever it is a multistoried affair where the royal proclamation of 1763 the indian removal act of 1830 and the conflicts with slavery and abolition pushed the boundaries of the frontier into mexican territory and the invasion of 1846 all these wars came to be both valve and throttle with each conflict simultaneously venting the hatreds produced by the last while creating the conditions for the next and as war begets war a state born out of ceaseless expansion could only be maintained through ceaseless expansion 1898 marks a redefinition of the frontier the frontier reached a physical limit in north america and by necessity expanded overseas creating an american history fast turning into an endless public parade of war and more war overseas war had the effect of unifying the country this time not some sections against others but the whole nation the military became the primary means of social mobility allowing both whites and blacks shelter from the capitalist market grandin s history continues through the roosevelt era and into the new deal pre war era after the second world war the frontier was rejuvenated as a future that might be obtained it involved a u s security frontier already established in the western hemisphere now expanded to a global position a major part of that was linking the cold war and its anti communism to a new politics of expansion in particular the global economy as a new frontier globalization in all its manifestations this expanded with reagan with his promises of freedom from restraint with no limits to growth individual and economic rights markets overpowered human and social rights the violence and racism ongoing along the mexican border was redirected to cold war counter insurgencies leading to many more immigrants the u s was still a beacon a magnet for all the pilgrims from all the lost places reagan s successor gwh bush expanded on the frontier idea in the frontiers ahead there are no boundaries nafta one of the big surprises in the book and if i had thought about it carefully should not have been was the emphasis grandin placed on the north american free trade agreement even before the agreement was enacted there were already 1925 work plants in mexico taking advantage of the low wage labour and the lack of labour and environmental regulations with the huge increase in interest rates in 1980 to an average of seventeen per cent many u s businesses and farmers lost their livelihoods those same interest rates created a huge debt repayment problem in mexico leading to the imf shock doctrine of austerity privatization cut spending lax foreign investment controls weaken labour laws and stop land reform in short even before nafta mexico had succumbed to u s economic expansion and control nafta affected the poor farmers as subsidized u s corn dairy and pork killed their subsistence living they were forced into cheap wage labour for u s corporations into drug trafficking and into the urban sprawl of mexico city the corporations had their new frontier the blowback to this was increased immigration and the rapid rise in border patrol actions the border patrol was a frontline instrument of white supremacist power the u s became a country that increasingly defines itself by what it hates a decade of free trade neither created an international community of prosperous peace loving nations nor overcome domestic political divisions with the administration of george bush the 9 11 attack offered a chance to turn away from the border and look out at the world anew now clarifying the mission as we will extend the frontiers of freedom turning inwards but as with the vietnam war and the many other smaller counterinsurgencies foreign wars produce domestic disruption as the struggle turns inwards the backlashes to decades of disastrous policies piled up one after the other until the backlash to the backlashes came trump the mexican border wall fits into the underlying racism of u s culture it is a valve that needs to be turned off or on as convenient for political purposes it is also a valve for the many war vets to release their frustrations against a targeted other along with the veterans it allows many others to practice their rugged individualism as vigilantes along the border expressing their racist white supremacism against groups of aliens created in the most part by u s imperial actions trump s new freedom is freedom from constraint his cruelty and hedonism giving permission to many others to accept those actions and also to practice them still more frontiers while grandin focuses on the image of the mexican border wall as a sign of the closure of the frontier he does not delve into contemporary u s military actions around the world the imperial frontier is faltering in many respects as events in ukraine and syria and the failure of past actions in iraq afghanistan and libya have well demonstrated but it is still there perhaps more as bluster and rhetoric as witnessed with venezuela than a true frontier a rhetorical ideological rant to redirect domestic concerns and attempt to somehow keep the empire alive and its frontiers still an active zone the strength of the end of the myth is that it does not take any imagination to extend the myth into other areas of u s foreign policy grandin has explored the myth very effectively highlighting the idea of frontier as it changed over time leaving us with trump as the ultimate characterization of the state of the union at this point in time a fascinating work it defines the psychological mythical constructs of the u s imperial mind very well jim miles is a canadian educator and a regular contributor columnist of opinion pieces and book reviews for the

kuwait s economic growth is expected to accelerate this year and beyond thanks to higher oil prices after a challenging few years but fiscal financing needs remain large and the government must enact reforms to strengthen its position the international monetary fund said growth is expected to strengthen and the underlying fiscal position to gradually improve over the medium term the washington based lender said in a report on wednesday following the conclusion of its 2019 consultation with kuwait gross domestic product growth in kuwait opec s fifth largest oil producer is projected at 2 5 per cent for 2019 up from 1 7 per cent last year and a 3 5 per cent contraction in 2017 according to imf figures kuwait is benefitting from an increase in oil prices with benchmark brent nearing 70 a barrel on wednesday oil prices in the first quarter of this year had the highest quarterly increase since 2009 thanks to crude output cuts by opec the alliance grouping opec members and countries outside the organisation led by russia kuwait s current account rebounded in 2017 after the country posted its first deficit in more than two decades in 2016 and reached an estimated surplus of 12 7 per cent of gdp last year driven by higher oil prices and increased investment according to the imf hydrocarbon output rose by 1 2 per cent in 2018 after contracting a year earlier meanwhile inflation fell to a multi year low of 0 7 per cent due to falling housing rents easing food prices and a strengthening kuwaiti dinar the banking sector is also showing sound indicators and liquidity ratios the imf said however given the volatility of oil prices and exhaustible oil reserves kuwait must enact fiscal and structural reforms to reduce its dependence on oil boost government saving and create more private sector jobs what is more parliamentary delays have frustrated the passage of a new debt law meaning the government has been unable to issue debt since october 2017 and had to draw on its reserves for financing among the much needed reforms are a tightening of the hefty public sector wage bill capital investment to improve infrastructure and grow the private sector and the introduction of a delayed 5 per cent vat on goods and services in line with plans set up by the rest of the six country gcc the imf said deeper fiscal reforms to ensure adequate savings for future generations the imf said a robust fiscal framework and strong governance are vital to bolstering fiscal policy credibility structural reforms should seek to improve the business environment support entrepreneurship and foster productivity it added the report made several recommendations including further easing administrative procedures facilitating cross border trading ramping up efforts to promote competition in the market and increasing access to finance and tenders for small businesses and start ups
briefing highlights trade pact at risk of accident an ontario scene i d love to see stocks loonie oil at a glance toronto homes sales flat in march trump to powell i guess i m stuck with you brookfield said to eye china deal required reading risk of accident a major u s bank is warning investors about the risks of a major nafta accident as president donald trump battles the house democrats and canada and mexico fight the americans which means the canadian dollar is also at risk of an accident jpmorgan chase didn t say it like that those are my words but it did say those risks reinforce its bearish views on the loonie the three governments have penned the u s mexico canada deal which is supposed to be the successor to the north american free trade agreement but the pact has yet to be ratified which is where said accident could come into play according to jpmorgan global foreign exchange strategist daniel hui and his colleagues paul meggyesi and patrick locke a few months after signing the new usmca nafta 2 0 the ratification process is gathering steam and there are indications that the administration seeks to complete the deal potentially by august but in our view this compressed timeline could very well put president trump on a collision course with house speaker nancy pelosi sooner rather than later with risks of a major nafta accident mr hui mr meggyesi and mr locke said in a report on currency markets accelerating the approval process will likely meet resistance from house democrats led by speaker pelosi they added warning of this significant risk open this photo in gallery house speaker nancy pelosithe associated press trying to get it done by august would mean congress would have to vote soon mr trump could also up the ante by pulling out of the original nafta as a bargaining ploy which risks derailing passage altogether by democrats the jpmorgan strategists said this is an important channel we ve flagged that could ultimately devolve into a nafta worst case blowup among the hurdles they see democrats want changes the u s international trade commission s report on the impact isn t completed unions are signalling resistance and canada and mexico want steel and aluminum tariffs removed the jpmorgan strategists laid out two timelines one that could see the pact ratified before the summer recess the other a possible path of delays that

global growth has lost momentum since the start of the year leaving the world economy in a precarious position the managing director of the international monetary fund imf christine lagarde said yesterday the global economy has weakened since the imf last updated its forecast in late january though a recession isn t likely in the near term bloomberg quoted lagarde to have said in remarks prepared for a speech at the us chamber of commerce in washington lagarde characterised the slowdown as a synchronised deceleration during a panel discussion after her speech in january the fund lowered its projection for world economic growth forecasting expansion of 3 5 per cent this year and 3 6 percent in 2020 it was the imf s second cut in the outlook in three months the fund would release its new world economic outlook with an updated growth forecast on april 9 the global economy is at a delicate moment lagarde said in her speech her warning comes as global finance ministers and central bankers prepare to convene in washington next week for the semi annual meetings of the imf and world bank while confidence has been boosted by the federal reserve s switch to a more patient stance and signs of a trade deal between the us and china investors remain concerned the global expansion may be running out of steam a decade after the financial crisis lagarde said the global economy was set to benefit from the patience of major central banks as well as increased stimulus by the chinese government the imf predicts global growth would pick up some in the second half of 2019 and into 2020 she said still that rebound remains vulnerable to a host of risks including britain s exit from the european union high debt in some sectors and countries trade tensions and a sense of unease in financial markets lagarde said given the state of the global economy it s important for policy makers to avoid missteps she said monetary policy should remain accommodative where inflation is below target while exchange rate flexibility should be used as needed according to lagarde regulatory reforms aimed at strengthening the financial sector should continue she added high public debt and low interest rates have left limited room to act when the next downturn comes which inevitably it will she said i am not saying that we currently have a monopoly problem but i am saying that we should take appropriate measures so that it does not become a problem she said lagarde reiterated her warning for countries to avoid imposing new tariffs on each other an increase in tariff by 25 per centage points on all goods traded between the us and china would reduce annual output in the u s by up to 0 6 per cent and up to 1 5 per cent in china she said these are potentially self inflicted wounds that should be avoided lagarde said
reading time 5 minutes there is no magic bullet for curing venezuela s hyperinflation although over the past several years nicolás maduro has flirted with the introduction of virtual currencies slashed zeroes from mind blowing values and implemented half baked currency reforms none of these attempts have even remotely solved the problem venezuela s prices have continued to triple on a monthly basis making it the most severe hyperinflation to ever affect latin america given maduro s incompetence and the venezuelan public s total loss of faith in his ability to administer the economy it seems highly unlikely that he will ever solve the problem but once maduro leaves office whenever that day comes there is a roadmap that accounts for the unique technical and psychological challenges presented by hyperinflation brazil s successful experience nearly a quarter of a century ago hyperinflation generally defined by prices that rise more than 500 annually are rare there have only been about 15 cases since the beginning of the 20th century because they are rare they are also very difficult to study properly some hyperinflations are the result of war such as germany s during the weimar republic some are the result of printing money to finance debt payments or to cover fiscal deficits some are the product of both deficit and or debt financing through money creation and the complete erosion of trust in the value of a country s currency that erosion of trust is endogenous it comes about because the government is engaged in policies that destroy the value of the currency how does a government destroy the value of its own currency since fiat money is not worth anything on its own i e it is not like gold minted coins people will accept paper money only when they trust the government s capacity to reimburse them in the form of being able to purchase goods and services when the government runs policies that are not consistent with sustaining the values printed on bank notes credibility will be eroded and inflation expectations will begin to rise if the government keeps debasing the currency at some point people will try to get rid of it by converting bank notes into whatever they can goods or currencies issued by other countries that is the situation afflicting venezuela stopping a hyperinflation is not simple it requires institutional and political stability which venezuela currently does not have because dollars have now partly replaced the bolívar as venezuelans currency of choice when and if they are able to receive them creating a new currency to replace the beleaguered one will be very hard for this reason some countries that have battled hyperinflations have chosen to fully dollarize their economies once political and institutional stability had been stored this is what zimbabwe did after a severe bout of hyperinflation in 2008 full dollarization however has its drawbacks when a country gives up its own currency to use the dollar it forgoes the ability to conduct monetary policy which can be a very important economic stabilization tool in the future when a country has fully dollarized it becomes subject to the whims of the fed if the u s central bank raises interest rates monetary conditions will be tightened both in the united states and in the country that has decided to dollarize if that country is facing a recession it would have been better served by loose not tight monetary policy additionally dollarized countries do not have control over their exchange rates because they no longer have their own currencies therefore if they would like to devalue to boost their exports they are unable to do so think of greece in 2010 when it was unable to let its currency go to respond to the crisis it was facing because it no longer had control to avoid the pitfalls of full dollarization venezuela may have other options and this is where brazil s experience in 1994 may prove instructive brazil at the time had been dealing with two decades of very high inflation peaking in 1993 at around 2 500 for the same reasons outlined above brazil decided it would not dollarize instead it chose to reform its monetary system in a very broad and ingenious way an initiative known as the plano real or the real plan first brazil needed to find a solution to runaway fiscal deficits because the country had been struggling with hyperinflation for so long politicians were amenable to approving deep fiscal reforms that would put an end to years of money printing to finance debts and deficits this was phase one of the real plan phase two and this is where things get a bit complex was the creation of a virtual currency dubbed the urv or unidade real de valor real unit of value the urv was not an actual bank note but a unit of account from the time of its creation all prices in stores supermarkets and so on were required to list prices in urvs however since there were no actual urvs in circulation people would pay for goods by converting urvs into their holdings of the previous currency then the cruzeiro real the rate of conversion of urvs into cruzeiros reais would change on a daily basis according to market forces the idea was that prices in urvs would remain relatively stable on a monthly basis while prices in cruzeiros reais were still rising it was a kind of transitionary tool that recognized hyperinflation was just as much a behavioral problem as an economic one and therefore it could not be stopped overnight fernando henrique cardoso the finance minister who oversaw the design of the real plan and later became president later called the urv a sleight of hand the public had to see that prices were leveling out over time before they would believe in any new currency indeed as time went by people became accustomed to the idea that hyperinflation was a cruzeiro real problem but not a urv problem fiscal conditions had been set to guarantee the stability of prices in urv and there was no more irresponsible printing of money once enough confidence in the urv had been established phase three of the real plan went into effect the cruzeiro real was extinguished and the urv became the real which is brazil s currency to this day the ingenuity of the real plan was to combine deep reforms to fiscal and monetary policies with an understanding of behavioral factors influencing trust in a given currency at first the urv a virtual currency at a time when virtual currencies were practically unheard of the plan was a success as inflation fell from monthly rates of 45 in march and april 1994 to just 2 in july the month the real was launched inflation in brazil has been mostly in single digits ever since could it be replicated in venezuela possibly to do so would require substantial international assistance in rebuilding institutions such as the treasury and the central bank as well as balance of payments support through external financing once these conditions are met and political stability has been minimally established brazil was far from politically stable in the mid 1990s something like the real plan could perhaps address venezuela s problems granted we are still a long way from seeing when nicolás maduro will fall let alone when venezuelan institutions will be restored that however is not to say that venezuela won t remain a challenging and fascinating case for macroeconomists the world over especially for those in latin america who still remember what it was like to carry no cash lest inflation

use the lexology getting the deal through tool to compare the answers in this article with those from other jurisdictions market framework government electricity participants who are the principal government participants in the electricity sector what roles do they perform in relation to 160 renewable energy the ministry of energy the moe is responsible for establishing and implementing policies related to the development of nepal s energy resources the regulation of the energy sector and the conservation and use of energy the department of the electricity authority the doed is a division within the ministry of energy that issues the licences and approvals that are required in connection with the generation transmission and distribution of electricity in nepal note however that the investment board of nepal has jurisdiction over the issuance of licences and approvals in relation to hydroelectric projects with a capacity in excess of 500mw the rates paid by end users are established by the electricity tariff fixation committee the etfc which is an independent regulatory body established by statute the nepal electricity authority the nea is a vertically integrated utility that generates transmits distributes and supplies electricity it owns and operates the national transmission system and the distribution systems that are connected to and supplied by the transmission system private sector participants also generate electricity which they sell to the nea under power purchase agreements two pension funds the employees provident fund and the civil investment fund are active in funding the development of power projects through their debt and equity investments the government recently enacted legislation to constitute an electricity regulatory commission the commission will be an economic and technical regulator that will among other things be responsible for approving the prices for capacity and energy that are payable under power purchase agreements and for setting the tariffs that are paid by end users the government is in process of forming the commission the commission will replace the etfc private electricity participants who are the principal private participants in the electricity sector what roles do they serve in relation to renewable energy the principal private sector participants are independent power projects ipps the developers that develop them and the banks and other lenders that provide construction loans to fund the development and construction of ipps several cooperatives organised by communities that are not served by the nea have been formed to develop operate and maintain micro hydro projects and microgrids that have been funded by various development grants in terms of lenders nepalese banks and financial institutions have made a considerable number of loans to hydropower projects nepal rastra bank nrb which is the central bank of nepal has issued directives requiring all banks and financial institutions that operate in nepal to lend a designated percentage of their newly originated loans to hydropower projects in nepal these obligations are enforced with penalties levied on financial institutions that fail to comply with these directives definition of renewable energy is there any legal definition of what constitutes renewable 160 energy or clean power or their equivalents 160 in 160 your jurisdiction hydro solar and wind power are considered to be renewable or clean energy however there is no specific legal definition for renewable energy framework what is the legal and regulatory framework applicable to developing financing operating and selling power and environmental attributes from renewable energy projects the moe issues survey licences which grant the holder thereof the exclusive right to conduct feasibility studies and environmental impact assessments for renewable energy projects in a designated licence area survey licences may have a term of one year or two years depending on the size of the project they may be extended for a maximum term of up to five years at the discretion of the moe the moe also issues generation licences which grant a concession to the holder thereof to construct operate and maintain a generation facility on a build own operate transfer model generation licences may have a term of up to 30 years if the construction of a transmission line to connect a generation facility to the nea s transmission system is necessary then the project company will need to apply for and obtain a transmission licence licences for these types of connecting transmission lines are co terminus with the corresponding generation licence a concession agreement can be signed with the government if required by the developers or international lenders locally sourced financing does not require a concession agreement but local debt markets do not have the depth to provide the quantity of financing or the tenors that are required to finance large ipps upon completion of the concession period the project will be transferred to the government at no additional cost to the government in most cases however the power purchase agreements entered into by the nea have a term of only 25 years from and after the commercial operations date no private project has completed the initial period of 25 years stripping attributes can environmental attributes be stripped and sold separately there is no market in nepal for the sale of environmental attributes government incentives does the government offer incentives to promote the development of renewable energy projects in addition has the government established policies that also promote renewable energy the government has offered income tax exemptions tax holiday for a period of 10 years from and after the commercial operations date and a 50 per cent exemption thereafter for five years provided that a developer achieves commercial operations on or before 12 april 2024 the government has also offered a vat refund of 5 million nepalese rupees per megawatt for those who achieve commercial operations by that date are renewable energy policies and incentives generally established at the national level or are they established by states or other political subdivisions all energy policies including those that relate to renewable energy are established at the national level purchasing mechanisms what mechanisms are available to facilitate the purchase of renewable power by private companies there is no legal impediment to the development of on site generation projects other than obtaining a generation licence and building and similar permits legislative proposals describe any notable pending or anticipated legislative proposals regarding renewable energy in your jurisdiction an electricity bill that would replace the electricity act that is currently in force has been before parliament for some time with little progress the main objective of the bill is to establish clearer procedures for the licensing of generation projects drivers of change what are the biggest drivers of change in the renewable energy markets in your jurisdiction the two biggest drivers of change are the continuing development of microgrids that are powered by micro hydro projects or small scale solar arrays and the continuing extension of the nea s transmission and distribution systems to areas that are now underserved disputes framework describe the legal framework applicable to disputes between renewable power market participants related to pricing or otherwise the power purchase agreements the nea enters into typically contain arbitration provisions nepal is a contracting party to both the new york convention and the washington convention utility scale renewable projects project types and sizes describe the primary types and sizes of existing and planned utility scale renewable energy projects in your jurisdiction almost all the generation capacity in nepal is available from hydroelectric projects most of these projects are run of river ror projects with little or no capacity to store water in a reservoir the government has however realised that there is tremendous potential for the development of large scale hydroelectric projects with sizeable reservoirs that can be used to store water to reduce seasonal variations in the availability of generation capacity although developers have shown an interest in developing wind and solar projects they do not yet seem to be cost competitive given the abundant hydro resources with which nepal is blessed we expect the continuing fall in the price of photovoltaic solar to result in rapid change development issues what types of issues restrain the development of utility scale renewable energy projects the biggest challenges for renewable energy projects in nepal are the lack of transmission infrastructure and the inability of the nea to fund the development of the transmission lines that are necessary to connect new projects and the lack of depth in local lending markets combined with the unwillingness of the nea to enter into power purchase agreements with tariffs denominated in hard currencies and the swift and uneven depreciation of the nepalese rupee against hard currencies the government has attempted to address currency related issued by encouraging the nea to pay for electricity in hard currency for the first 10 years from and after the date on which a project achieves commercial operations the implementation of this policy would however effectively limit the tenor of loans denominated in foreign currencies to 10 years as a result of this and other challenges this policy has not yet resulted in the development of a project benefiting from a power purchase agreement with a tariff denominated in a foreign currency the government intends to establish a fund that would have the ability to enter into currency hedges with governmental authorities such as the nea and government owned and government controlled companies with significant payment obligations that are denominated in foreign currency the nea has indicated its intention to limit its exposure to power purchase agreements with capacity energy and other payment obligations that are denominated in foreign currencies to those payment obligations that are hedged by the fund hydropower primary types of project describe the primary types of hydropower projects that are prevalent most hydropower projects that are currently in operation are ror projects a few of them of them do have storage reservoirs earlier all power projects were owned by the nea however in recent years a considerable number of private developers are also engaged in developing small hydropower projects the projects owned by the nea are wholly owned by the nea however in the private projects 30 per cent of the shares in the project company are floated to the general public including project affected people and employees of the developer what legal considerations are relevant for hydroelectric generation in your jurisdiction approvals and clearances are the big challenges for developers approvals from multiple government authorities are required to complete feasibility studies and environmental impact assessments and begin construction a lack of coordination between the authorities has been identified by developers as a constraint on the development of projects distributed generation prevalence describe the prevalence of on site distributed generation projects net metering is not practised in nepal the nea has a programme in place to buy excess power from sugar plantations but this programme has not been put into practice types describe the primary types of distributed generation projects that are common in your jurisdiction not applicable regulation have any legislative or regulatory efforts been undertaken to promote the development of microgrids what are the most significant legal obstacles to the development of microgrids unfortunately no incentives have been made available to date other considerations what additional legal considerations are relevant for distributed generation none energy storage framework what storage technologies are used and what legal framework is generally applicable to them there are no energy storage projects in nepal development are there any significant hurdles to the development of energy storage projects the legal framework that would be necessary to support these types of projects has not been developed foreign investment ownership restrictions may foreign investors invest in renewable energy projects are there restrictions on foreign ownership relevant to renewable energy projects yes foreign investors can invest in renewable energy projects in nepal and investment in renewable energy projects by foreign investors has increased significantly in recent years there is no restriction on foreign investment in renewable energy projects equipment restrictions what restrictions are in place with respect to the import of foreign manufactured equipment no specific restrictions are in place projects general government authorisation what government authorisations must investors or owners obtain prior to constructing or directly or indirectly transferring or acquiring a renewable energy project project licences survey licence for generation of power survey licence for transmission of power generation licences or construction licences for the transmission of power are the main authorisations required for investors offtake arrangements what type of offtake arrangements are available and typically used for utility scale renewables projects the nea is currently the only utility scale offtaker in nepal procurement of offtaker agreements how are long term power purchase agreements procured by the offtakers in your jurisdiction are they the subject of feed in tariffs the subject of multi project competitive tenders or are they typically developed through the submission of unsolicited tenders the tariff that is payable by the nea under power purchase agreements is established as a feed in tariff for all projects with a capacity of less than 100mw for projects over 100mw the nea procures power purchase agreements through direct negotiations the nea has determined that it will not pay rates that will result in a projected equity internal rate of return in excess of 17 per cent operational authorisation what government authorisations are required to operate a renewable energy project and sell electricity from renewable energy projects the obtaining of the aforementioned licences is all that is required decommissioning are there legal requirements for the decommissioning of renewable energy projects must these requirements be funded by a sinking fund or through other credit enhancements during the operational phase of a renewable energy project there is no provision for the decommissioning of projects this is an outgrowth of the extremely long expected lifetime for hydroelectric projects

bangkok ap trade tensions between china and the united states are putting a drag on economies in the region with growth likely to continue to slow in the coming two years the asian development bank says in a report released wednesday the manila philippines based regional lender s latest economic outlook forecasts that growth in developing asia will slow slightly to 5 7 this year and 5 6 in 2020 in 2017 growth was at 6 2 the main risk to the outlook is still the ongoing trade conflict as heightened trade policy uncertainty can negatively affect investment and manufacturing activity it said a sharper slowdown in the advanced economies or the prc people s republic of china is another risk the update comes as china and the u s prepare for another round of talks this week in washington aimed at resolving their dispute over china s industrial policies and acquisition of technology after the dispute escalated in mid 2018 with both sides imposing billions of dollars worth of tariffs on each other s products world trade weakened contracting nearly 2 in january from a year earlier the report shows it said the solid growth momentum in the first nine months of the year began to fade in the last quarter growth in industrial production also showed signs of weakness the adb report said this is an added burden as the business cycle for major economies heads into a negative trend said the adb s chief economist yasuyuki sawada this global business cycle seems to create some impact on asian economies he said in an interview it s not only trade tensions other reports show similar sluggishness in the region which remains the main driver for world economic growth the latest set of purchasing manager indexes showed slight improvements in exports in march from january february for indonesia vietnam thailand and taiwan as well as china but other data suggest that growth in china could well weaken again in the near term capital economics said in a report as such we think it is too soon to predict a turn in fortunes for the region s manufacturing sectors the asian development bank forecasts that growth in major economies will slip to 1 9 in 2019 and 1 6 in 2020 from 2 2 last year the u s economy is forecast to expand at a 2 4 annual rate this year slowing from 2 9 in 2018 and to decelerate to 1 9 growth in 2020 japan s growth will remain flat at 0 8 this year it estimates and fall to 0 6 next year the bank expects growth in the area using the euro to fall to 1 5 in 2019 and 2020 from 1 8 in 2018 on the positive side inflation should remain manageable and domestic demand in many economies in southeast and south asia is vibrant the asian development bank said that s less true of east asia where consumers have grown more cautious about spending auto sales in china for example have plunged in recent months in one of the biggest reversals of sentiment developing countries in asia are seeing an uptick in investment from many parts of the world especially china it noted china s foreign direct investment in new projects such as renewable energy textile factories and property in the region nearly tripled while investment by the u s jumped by nearly three quarters while much of the adb s report focused on trade and investment the bank urged governments across the region to devote more resources to cultivating resilience and taking measures to help prevent or mitigate natural disasters the report noted that 84 of the 206 million people affected by natural disasters each year in 2000 2018 lived in developing asian economies more than half of the 60 000 deaths from such catastrophes each year were in this region which suffers a large share of extreme weather events and earthquakes the report says that a large share of the 1 7 trillion in annual investments in infrastructure needed over the coming decade should go to reducing risks from such disasters one area of concern is insurance almost all direct damage is not covered by insurance sawada said another area that could yield strong results is in weather forecasting and warnings in the asia pacific home to four of every five people affected by storms and other disasters while earthquakes and tsunamis are virtually impossible to predict when it comes to extreme weather there is room for constructing mechanisms and building up early warning systems sawada said there is huge potential
the subway belongs to us public goods april 3 2019 andy battle one evening in november i left my job at hunter college and descended to the platform at sixty eighth street home to the number 6 train which shambles down one of new york s most notoriously crowded and poor performing subway lines for a hundred years the lexington avenue line colored a sort of forest green on the metropolitan transit authority s mta familiar maps has been the only subway serving manhattan s densely packed east side with the demolition of the second and third avenue elevated lines in 1942 and 1955 it became the only train period serving that half of the island the els were demolished with the expectation that the city would relieve the resulting congestion by constructing a second avenue subway a project first proposed in 1919 before anyone i know was alive work started on the second avenue subway in 1972 in the waning days of new york s unique brand of municipal social democracy three years later the city s legendary fiscal crisis erupted and construction was halted as the city scrambled merely to keep the existing system from collapsing thirty two years and a political economic revolution later construction resumed on the half dug tunnels and in 2017 with meticulously choreographed fanfare new york governor andrew cuomo cut the ribbon on the second avenue subway ninety nine years after the first plans were drafted like all public projects in these shriveled times though the second avenue subway bore the marks of the austerity regime under which it was conceived comprising just three stations the line serves a twenty four block stretch of the upper east side one of the city s more comfortable sections its major effect so far has been to jump start real estate development the sine qua non of all new york city politics pushing up rents and lining the pockets of the big developers who fund the governor s political campaigns i used to think things like subways were built because there was a social need for them that was before i learned what capitalism is and how it works anxiety and anger underneath the engaged omniscient and tirelessly encouraging façade i present to the students i love and admire lies a significant wellspring of anxiety and anger the city university of new york pays its so called adjunct lecturers who teach over half of all courses salaries so low that there have been times where i could not afford basic necessities such as a subway pass a commodity whose price has risen 33 per cent since i moved to new york city in 2009 i am not alone outside the gates at every station groups of supplicants stand attentively seeking eye contact with exiting passengers a fleeting connection secured they gesture furtively with their hands and mouth the word swipe hoping to win the generosity of a stranger and get wherever they need to go others jump the turnstiles when they feel no one is looking often into the arms of police who lurk behind walls and around corners risk is a way of life for the poor in this most expensive of cities all of this weighs on my mind as i descend to the platform like other low income new yorkers at the end of this journey i will trade one scene of exploitation for another settling in for another meal of legumes in the crumbling brooklyn apartment whose owners demand 60 per cent of my income and resort to every subterfuge to sneak new rent increases past the state in between is the nightly gauntlet that is the new york city subway every evening one hopes against hope that the ride might resemble its ideal a quick zip through the tunnels stops at the expected stations seats for all as we read listen and stare our way home blissfully unaware of the complex interwoven nest of effort that makes it all possible our intellects however having catalogued with cruel precision the subway s deterioration over the past several years tell us to prepare for something else the platform sparse when i entered begins to bulge with people as trains fail to arrive at their scheduled times collective anxiety mounts finally a light from the tunnel bounces across the rusted girders but the train fails to slow and a bleat of the horn signals that this one already late and too packed to let anyone on is skipping sixty eighth street tonight the system has landed its first blow before long another train arrives groaning into the station like a wounded animal my shoulders relax a bit fifteen minutes later we have reached the city hall stop transferring trains in new york generally threatens fresh catastrophe the second i step from the train i see my luck has run out the deck is stuffed buzzing with a malign energy the sum of a thousand individual panics trapped and amplified on this decomposing hulk of subterranean concrete the platform is a scene of disorder no one faces the tracks as they would if they expected a train to arrive older women and parents with children jockey for seats on the wooden benches few in number and uncomfortable by design as part of the city s longstanding commitment to punish and frustrate the homeless the countdown clocks electronic signs meant to tell you the wait time for your train mock themselves with constantly shifting crazy quilt predictions before crashing at last into digital gibberish a train is coming in seven minutes no four no nineteen no twenty eight finally the white flag goes up and the signs retreat to the bare word delay my fellow new yorkers are losing it don t listen to nothing on those signs laughs an off duty mta worker her jovial detachment sends one rider over the edge it has been clear for several minutes that he is the weak link in whatever tenuous social peace remains sweating profusely pacing back and forth in jerky movements he pleads with anyone who will listen that he has been in the system for two and a half hours in a fruitless effort to traverse the city from the bronx to brooklyn it is not hard to see that the attendant has committed a blunder a more seasoned bureaucrat would know to avoid she has engaged whether she knows it or not in addressing a passenger she has agreed to become for this fleeting instant the human face of the mta an organization whose actual rulers know better than to use the trains the ensuing exchange devolves into near violence get fucked you rat bitch is the last thing i hear as i trade bedlam for the rainy streets above risk is a way of life for the poor in this most expensive of cities behind the statistics that describe the lives of the urban poor is something less quantifiable the toll of the gradual abdication of society by the rich over the last forty years is exacted not only in dollars and cents but in stress anger hopelessness and frustration what we could call the affective fruits of disinvestment these issue not only in day to day rancor but in shortened lives some americans especially people of color have always known this but as the upward redistribution of wealth proceeds apace the sense that one s life is enmeshed in a crisis begins to generalize in a densely packed city like new york the subway becomes a site where we can feel such a crisis swelling in especially acute fashion the reason the subways perform so poorly in new york can be summed up simply no one in charge cares to spend enough money to make them run properly and in the absence of any social movement that could force them to do this they don t have to the problem is exacerbated by the garish corruption that the new york times has been using to chase pulitzers for the last couple years there is no objective reason for instance why the cost of the second avenue subway should outstrip that of similar projects in similarly situated cities by a surreal factor of seven the mta has been exposed as a foul warren infested with overpaid managers armies of consultants scads of low or no show jobs uncompetitive bidding and a revolving door between government and business like so many other institutions in american life the agency in addition to running or not running the subways operates as a vast private welfare state managed in relative secrecy sucking on a giant funnel of money fed by new york s high and highly regressive taxes at the same time to focus on corruption misses something important about the forces that have brought us to this point there is another reading of the history of the subway one that presents it as a struggle over commodification and its consequences in this story the subway s deterioration is part of a failure to resolve the contradiction between urban space as a vehicle for the satisfaction of human need and urban space as an instrument for the extraction of profit by this light the struggles over the subway reflect tensions at the heart of the capitalist state the subways were not built for people like you and me they were built for people like j p morgan cornelius vanderbilt ii and elbert gary of u s steel who financed the first railway tunnels under the hudson and erected what was then the largest office compound in the world atop its terminal in lower manhattan they were built for people like abram hewitt the iron baron turned new york mayor who dreamt the political architecture public financing private profit that got the system built but did not live to see it open in 1904 they were built for people like august belmont jr heir to his father s rothschild backed banking fortune who as president of the interborough rapid transit company obtained a monopoly on public transit in manhattan and refused to build new lines unless the city agreed to pay for them and guarantee his profits and they were built for people like charles t barney the land speculator who became a director of the irt in time to glean inside information on its proposed route as a result he was able to organize a syndicate that guzzled up still cheap land in northern manhattan and the bronx which he and his fellow developers transformed from a farming province into the sixth largest city in america in the course of just five years when the twentieth century began manhattan s lower east side was the most crowded place on earth the subway changed all that tripling the size of new york s built environment and rearranging the geography of work residence and leisure our forebears among the working people of new york were less the architects of these changes than their raw material they remained proletarians their lives marked by a profound lack of autonomy significant to capital only insofar as they could be mobilized as grist for the mill of profit the toll of the gradual abdication of society by the rich over the last forty years is exacted not only in dollars and cents but in stress anger hopelessness and frustration what we could call the affective fruits of disinvestment the key to understanding the historical trajectory of the new york city subway is to grasp that throughout its history all attempts to dedicate the system to use value in other words to make it a vehicle for the satisfaction of human needs instead of a machine for the extraction of profit have met with hostility and abandonment by the rich private capital mostly forsook the subways after world war i when opportunities for profit became difficult to locate the threats were economic and importantly political mayor john hylan a democrat and one time motorman still bitter at his dismissal by the brooklyn union elevated railroad had lurched left to fight off a socialist challenger and found that belligerence toward the hated transit companies was a reliable vote getter during his mayoralty hylan defended the five cent fare as inviolable pilloried the companies at every opportunity and authorized the construction of a city owned subway planned built and operated to meet the transportation needs of the people and not solely for the financial advantage of the operating companies or their officials hylan s independent subway system ind was an assault on the private companies who sought desperately to raise the fare the city instead of guaranteeing their profits now moved to jeopardize them and because the ind competed with existing lines instead of opening up new frontiers for development it drew an icy dismissal from real estate developers who instead turned their attention to highways the newest instrument of american capitalism s growth at all costs ethos but the ind was the future of mass transit in new york when the private companies failed during the depression the city became the owner of all three systems and the five cent fare was enshrined as a sacred principle of what hylan had called the people s subway when the subway was a source of profit private interests supported it when it became a public good it became their target paul windels was a lawyer who cut his teeth throwing communists out of city college for the rapp coudert committee new york s own little huac in 1940 he formed the committee of fifteen an anti tax pressure group composed of bankers industrialists and realtors the committee sought to reduce property taxes by busting the five cent fare and putting the subways in the hands of a quasi private authority shielded from public accountability the fare hike was a naked class issue the modern equivalent of the bread assize as one historian puts it on april 20 1948 mayor william o dwyer sided with the elites and doubled the five cent fare by 1953 the system was in the hands of the new york city transit authority run on a profit seeking basis by a board of hand picked appointees as if to drive home the point the transit authority was launched with another fare hike the project to re commodify the subways to push the cost of their operation back onto the working class had begun the five cent fare joined price controls rent regulation trade union power and universal health care as features of a nebulous american social democracy choked at birth by the grasping hand of postwar reaction in short the subway had been saved from democracy in this telling the 1920s and 1930s are the golden age of the new york city subway they represent the moment when political control over a key social good was exercised on behalf of ordinary new yorkers in a way not seen before or since at the same time and for the same reason it was the moment when the subway became a burden to the rich instead of an asset it can be tempting to look to the city s spectacular fiscal crisis of the mid 1970s as the dawn of the subway s problems but just as the fiscal crisis was the culmination of decisions made decades earlier the decline of the subway was determined in key ways by the political triumph of the rich in the immediate postwar period and in particular by the subway s effective privatization in 1953 the trains did not turn overnight into the broken down graffiti scarred warhorses that serve as emblems of the storied 1970s when the city s abandonment by capital created a vacuum into which artists and other devotees of use value could temporarily swell that the subways began to run on a shoestring as early as the 1940s is evidenced by robert caro s descriptions of the crumbling cattle cars of the 1950s and 1960s in the power broker his monumental work of new york history since that time the history of the subway has been part of what we might call the long fiscal crisis a series of stopgap efforts to prevent the system s collapse while foisting as much of the cost as possible onto the backs of a working class whose travails filtered differentially by race and gender formed the basis of what observers by the mid 1960s had designated with a resigned shorthand as the urban crisis the subsequent history of the trains a sorry burlesque of slashed budgets escalating fares looted funds and sordid self dealing can be read as part of this running battle to shield the rich from financial and political accountability to preserve their ability to seize the proceeds of the economic project we call new york while shifting its costs onto the rest of us the climax of this struggle was the fiscal crisis of the 1970s when the wealthy effectively suspended whatever democratic government had existed in new york city stripping elected officials of substantive control over spending decisions and resetting the municipal common sense to prioritize private accumulation at all costs what the history of the subway since then shows us is that the crisis was not so much solved as its burdens rearranged in a thousand cruel ways there come times when we can no longer bear these burdens i m on the 6 train in december as the semester limps to a close a homeless man teeters between the cars fumbling unsuccessfully with a cigarette lighter as the train rocks him within an inch of death the car is a rubik s cube of matter faces asses armpits backpacks shopping bags pushcarts that manages to arrange itself anew at each stop the train shrieks to a halt in the middle of the tunnel as a man and a woman beside me quarrel over space in this war of words the man is no match for his antagonist he tries a trump card i m a black man he shouts hoping to cow his opponent a black woman the gambit fizzles you re a piece of shit she replies coolly he resorts weakly to bitch a man standing next to the woman wheels back and smacks him in the jaw the melee that ensues is not like the fights you see in the movies it is messy flailing erratic the combatants bounce off the walls each other and us the car starts moving again adding volatility to the contest and turning the rest of us into the unwilling inhabitants of an overstuffed pinball machine hurtling through an underground tunnel at forty miles an hour people are screaming someone s soup goes flying after what seems like an impossibly long time the train pulls into a station and the loser has an opportunity to slink away the rest of us soaked and disheveled recompose ourselves and soldier on soldiering is a good description of what new yorkers do to survive in a city that feels like it is reverting to a feudal past but the flip side of soldiering is masochism pleasure from powerlessness sometimes i think being able to take things like this in stride makes us tough makes us new yorkers the politicians who have ruined the subway certainly encourage this view but other times i know it makes us weak all around me friends try experiments bucking as best they can the material and emotional consequences of our era s blueprint for capital accumulation before i examined its history i imagined i would find a period when the subway worked when it was not entangled in crisis then i realized that our needs themselves even the very basic ones are the crisis as far as capitalism is concerned i get frustrated that the most common responses to the fiasco are individual and alienating to complain on social media to vote with one s feet to make do given that our means of making do are fractured along lines of race class and gender such individualized responses only ratify and harden our collective political disability at the same time i don t have a comprehensive strategy for wrenching the subway toward democratic control away from commodification and into the realm of the common good from new york to liverpool from detroit to jackson mississippi the history of capitalist urbanism is replete with examples of the struggle to reclaim an urban space for human needs after capital has exhausted its potential as a vehicle for accumulation and cast it off as worthless in new york these efforts are complicated by the rebirth of the city as a privileged site for capital accumulation since the 1970s a transformation executed over our heads by and for the most antidemocratic forces on the planet like most features of contemporary life this transformation has been accompanied by intense and growing inequality a relentless privatization of livability and an attendant hatred for anything common anything social it is no wonder the subway in some ways the epitome of a shared democratic space lionized by ordinary new yorkers for that very reason should be the target of such aggressive neglect movement to reclaim the subway what would a movement to reclaim the subway look like while its precise shape is impossible to predict the electoral system is likely to be a highly unreliable vehicle for achieving universal access and democratic control over public transport from the standpoint of the welfare of ordinary people new york s political system is deeply broken even if the normal barriers to power were eroded the lessons of the fiscal crisis when the pretense of democratic self government was discarded with breathtaking ease should caution us against imagining the state as a neutral instrument easily wielded by the working class the alternative is direct action as long as people keep paying their fares the message is clear we accept present conditions however begrudgingly direct action is about disruption it is about showing not telling its goal is to puncture the normal we should come to understand though that the governor s normal the financiers normal the real estate developers normal is our suffering our abnormal the goal of direct action should be to disrupt the normal abnormality of latter day new york for direct action to be disruptive it has to be massive and broad based that means people have to trust one another this can feel especially difficult today as contemporary capitalism fashions an ever more clenched anxious and insecure world whose politics express themselves in morbid visages filled with fear anger and resentment at the same time we are in the midst of a sequence of popular struggles rooted in direct action whose future is uncertain but whose causes have by no means dissipated participants in the arab spring the occupy movement black lives matter teachers strikes and a host of other battles know from hard won experience that direct action is transformative and contagious that it alters one s sense of time and of what is possible in the life we share in at least one case namely the 2013 protests that shook the brazilian state the precipitating event was an increase in transit fares the first step is to overcome alienation to talk to people this includes your friends fellow riders and transit workers whose roles give them insight into the system and a measure of power over it doing this requires a faith in the character and capacities of ordinary people insisting that every cook can govern ordinary people are smart creative and capable especially when offered a project that asks them to utilize what is most precious within them and that stands a reasonable chance of success evidence of this is all around us if we know where to look it is visible in any classroom at the city university of new york for example whose students in the main members of the working class immigrants and people of color routinely surmount enormous obstacles to reach deeply felt goals direct action movements have the potential to point beyond themselves by unmasking and rejecting the inhuman logic of capitalism which denies us the requisites of a fulfilling life unless we can prove we are useful to those who have money part of that struggle for fulfillment involves the right to move as we see fit to use the infrastructure that we have created by reorienting the city away from accumulation hoarding and exclusion we uncover its potential as a vehicle for the development of our capacity to support one another s aspirations our struggle in short should be conducted in the service of a benevolent appropriation it must be our guiding conviction that the subway like the future belongs to us this article first published on the commune website
new home sales for february were reported at 667 000 on a seasonally adjusted annual rate basis saar this was well above the consensus forecast and sales for january were revised up however sales for november and december were revised down with these revisions sales increased 1 in 2018 compared to 2017 i expect sales to be around the same level in 2019 as in 2018 and my guess is we haven t seen the peak of this cycle yet on inventory months of inventory is now just above the top of the normal range however the number of units completed and under construction is still somewhat low inventory will be something to watch very closely earlier new home sales increased to 667 000 annual rate in february click on graph for larger image this graph shows new home sales for 2018 and 2019 by month seasonally adjusted annual rate sales in february were up 0 6 year over year compared to february 2018 year to date just through february sales are up 2 8 compared to the same period in 2018 the comparison will be most difficult in q1 so this is a solid start for 2019 and here is another update to the distressing gap graph that i first started posting a number of years ago to show the emerging gap caused by distressed sales the distressing gap graph shows existing home sales left axis and new home sales right axis through february 2019 this graph starts in 1994 but the relationship had been fairly steady back to the 60s following the housing bubble and bust the distressing gap appeared mostly because of distressed sales the gap has persisted even though distressed sales are down significantly since new home builders have focused on more expensive homes i still expect this gap to slowly close however this assumes that the builders will offer some smaller less expensive homes if not then the gap will persist existing home sales are counted when transactions are closed and new home sales are counted when contracts are signed so the timing of sales is different

trade tensions between china and the united states are putting a drag on economies in the region with growth likely to continue to slow in the coming two years the asian development bank says in a report released wednesday the manila philippines based regional lender s latest economic outlook forecasts that growth in developing asia will slow slightly to 5 7 percent this year and 5 6 percent in 2020 in 2017 growth was at 6 2 percent the main risk to the outlook is still the ongoing trade conflict as heightened trade policy uncertainty can negatively affect investment and manufacturing activity it said a sharper slowdown in the advanced economies or the prc people s republic of china is another risk the annual update comes as china and the u s prepare for another round of talks this week in washington aimed at resolving their dispute over china s industrial policies and acquisition of technology after the dispute escalated in mid 2018 with both sides imposing billions of dollars worth of tariffs on each other s products world trade weakened contracting nearly 2 percent in january from a year earlier the report shows it said the solid growth momentum in the first nine months of the year began to fade in the last quarter growth in industrial production also showed signs of weakness the adb report said this is an added burden as the business cycle for major economies heads into a negative trend said the adb s chief economist yasuyuki sawada this global business cycle seems to create some impact on asian economies he said in an interview it s not only trade tensions other reports show similar sluggishness in the region which remains the main driver for world economic growth the latest set of purchasing manager indexes showed slight improvements in exports in march from january february for indonesia vietnam thailand and taiwan as well as china but other data suggest that growth in china could well weaken again in the near term capital economics said in a report as such we think it is too soon to predict a turn in fortunes for the region s manufacturing sectors the asian development bank forecasts that growth in major economies will slip to 1 9 percent in 2019 and 1 6 percent in 2020 from 2 2 percent last year the u s economy is forecast to expand at a 2 4 percent annual rate this year slowing from 2 9 percent in 2018 and to decelerate to 1 9 percent growth in 2020 japan s growth will remain flat at 0 8 percent this year it estimates and fall to 0 6 percent next year the bank expects growth in the area using the euro to fall to 1 5 percent in 2019 and 2020 from 1 8 percent in 2018 on the positive side inflation should remain manageable and domestic demand in many economies in southeast and south asia is vibrant the asian development bank said that s less true of east asia where consumers have grown more cautious about spending auto sales in china for example have plunged in recent months in one of the biggest reversals of sentiment developing countries in asia are seeing an uptick in investment from many parts of the world especially china it noted china s foreign direct investment in new projects such as renewable energy textile factories and property in the region nearly tripled while investment by the u s jumped by nearly three quarters while much of the adb s report focused on trade and investment the bank urged governments across the region to devote more resources to cultivating resilience and taking measures to help prevent or mitigate natural disasters the report noted that 84 percent of the 206 million people affected by natural disasters each year in 2000 2018 lived in developing asian economies more than half of the 60 000 deaths from such catastrophes each year were in this region which suffers a large share of extreme weather events and earthquakes the report says that a large share of the 1 7 trillion in annual investments in infrastructure needed over the coming decade should go to reducing risks from such disasters one area of concern is insurance almost all direct damage is not covered by insurance sawada said another area that could yield strong results is in weather forecasting and warnings in the asia pacific home to four of every five people affected by storms and other disasters while earthquakes and tsunamis are virtually impossible to predict when it comes to extreme weather there is room for constructing mechanisms and building up early warning systems sawada said there is huge potential
at the start of october 100 oil was the topic du jour with brent crude in the mid 80s per barrel bbl and wti sitting around 75 bbl sentiment quickly shifted as a confluence of factors combined to push wti to a relative bottom of 42 53 bbl on christmas eve so far this year oil has recovered significant ground hovering above 60 bbl currently and up 32 4 through march 29 for energy investors oil volatility has been an unwelcome distraction and detractor from performance for a sector that has been in the penalty box in recent years while companies across the space are doing what they can to court investors independent of commodity moves improving capital discipline emphasizing free cash flow pursuing returns focused growth oil prices will likely continue to largely steer the ship in terms of energy equity performance even for more defensive pockets of energy such as midstream read more and the integrated majors today we discuss the oil price volatility from the last six months and lay out both the bullish and bearish arguments for prices from here we also discuss some of the potential wildcards that could contribute to price swings lastly we look at consensus estimates for oil prices through 2022 sanction head fake drives 4q18 oil headache with cuts to the rescue in 1q19 for most of 2018 oil prices were generally trending higher the landscape quickly changed as prices cratered 44 3 from their relative peak on october 3 2018 to the relative low on december 24 while the move coincided with a broader market pullback symptomatic of an overall risk off trade several factors contributed to the dramatic weakening in global oil prices first and foremost saudi arabia stepped up its oil production after the us announced in may that it would reimpose iran sanctions production ramped in anticipation of us sanctions removing significant supply from iran in november in october media reports began discussing the potential for the us to issue waivers and ultimately the us threw a curveball by granting sanctions waivers to eight countries mitigating the impact on iranian crude exports adding to market oversupply was aggressive growth in us oil production which was up 1 9 million barrels per day mmbpd or 19 4 year over year in 2h18 versus 2h17 coinciding with a shift to market oversupply were rising concerns for the demand outlook as the global economy seemed to be losing its footing with us china trade relations continuing to languish at the time a strengthening us dollar also contributed to weakening oil prices a strong dollar makes oil which is priced in usd more expensive amidst tumbling prices and a worsening oversupply opec and its non opec counterparts namely russia agreed in early december to cut production by a combined 1 2 mmbpd for six months beginning january 1 2019 saudi arabia went above and beyond its agreed upon cuts by further slashing exports and production for example though it agreed to produce 10 3 mmbpd saudi arabia expects april production to come in below 10 mmbpd saudi arabia doing more than its fair share in terms of opec and allies production cuts combined with continued declines from venezuela1 anticipation of a us china trade deal and an improved outlook for the overall economy have underwritten the improvement in oil prices year to date as shown below backwardation in the brent and wti futures curves particularly the steeper backwardation for brent is indicative of a tighter undersupplied oil market where could oil prices go from here we lay out bull and bear scenarios below as well as potential wildcards the bull case supply interruptions worsen in the near term potential supply gap long term today the most compelling bull case for oil lies on the supply side in our view though the fate of production cuts remains a wildcard in the near to medium term the potential for supply impacts would be largely around geopolitical issues a la declining venezuela production or iran sanctions having more teeth as a result of fewer waivers in the long term i e over the next few years the bull case from a supply perspective is that an underinvestment in oil projects globally in recent years will lead to a supply gap specifically from 2014 to 2016 global upstream capital spending fell 44 and annual spending since 2016 has remained more than 300 billion below the 2014 level according to the international energy agency iea the iea estimates that production needs to grow by an amount equivalent to total north sea production 2 6 mmbpd in 2018 per bloomberg to offset declines in producing fields and keep global production flat if underinvestment leads to a supply gap and us shale cannot fill that gap an undersupplied market could result driving prices higher the bear case demand a greater concern than supply for now the bear argument for oil prices is largely wrapped up in demand concerns stemming from the potential for a global recession in the wake of the financial crisis global oil demand fell by 1 1 mmbpd 1 3 in 2009 as growing demand from non oecd countries could not offset a 2 2 mmbpd decrease from oecd countries2 keep in mind that opec and its partners are already restraining production by a similar amount 1 2 mmbpd with the iea forecasting demand growth of 1 4 mmbpd for 2019 an important difference to note between today and 2009 is that non oecd demand has eclipsed oecd demand3 which could lead to different demand sensitivities in a recession and less of an impact to demand than seen in 2009 on the supply side assuming existing production cuts are maintained until no longer needed and phased out in a measured way the threat to oil prices stems from us oil production growth leading to an oversupply we believe this is less likely in 2019 given us e ps focus on capital discipline and the fact that annual budgets were established during or shortly after the oil price pullback in 4q18 we expect more measured us oil production growth in 2019 relative to 2018 read more over the next few years us oversupply could be a potential threat if prices were to rise more meaningfully from today s levels thus incentivizing greater growth wildcards and known unknowns there are more moving parts to oil prices than we have real estate to discuss but we briefly touch on some of the potential drivers for prices in the coming months cut continuation or not opec and its partners will discuss the future of production cuts at the opec meeting scheduled for late june iran sanctions as six month sanction waivers begin to expire in may markets will be watching to see whether renewals are granted or other actions are taken media reports indicate that the near term goal is to reduce exports to less than 1 mmbpd but the ultimate objective is to bring exports to zero while also trying to avoid causing an oil price spike us china trade deal if a deal is not reached the implications for demand would be negative due to less physical trade but also in terms of the potential impact to the global economy currency moves because crude is priced in dollars a stronger dollar puts negative pressure on prices while a weaker dollar is supportive stronger emerging market currencies make usd priced oil more affordable supporting demand politics the impact to oil prices this fall from the us issuing iran sanctions waivers serves as a reminder that political actions can meaningfully move markets commentary from president trump further exemplifies the impact that politics can have on oil for example brent oil prices fell 3 5 on february 25 when the below tweet was posted brent rebounded by 0 7 the next day and gained a further 1 8 on february 27 as opec members reiterated their commitment to cuts last thursday president trump again tweeted about oil prices and the need for opec to increase production while brent prices dipped after the tweet the impact on the day was negligible as losses were erased nopec congress is currently considering legislation that would ban foreign nations from collaborating to manage fossil fuel markets if implemented the us department of justice could potentially sue countries for actions violating antitrust laws arguably the primary beneficiaries of opec and non opec cuts have been us oil producers and they may be the most negatively impacted in a world without opec and its partners taking action to support prices where are prices going that s the 50 60 70 or maybe 80 or 100 per barrel question in this piece we do not provide an oil forecast often forecasts tend to be reactionary and more akin to a mark to market other times forecasts reflect such a wide range that they become less useful a 20 or 30 per barrel range for an oil forecast is a bit like a golfer putting into a hole with a 2 foot diameter as is often said in the industry if someone could accurately predict oil prices and do so repeatedly they would probably be on a beach somewhere instead of writing research we include current consensus below and futures for those interested in the market view on oil forecasts for 2019 are relatively close to futures prices but the difference between consensus and futures widens the further out the projection consensus is more bullish than the backwardated futures curves but is generally in line with today s current pricing environment bottom line while supply and demand should fundamentally drive oil prices a myriad of factors can influence the balance between the two over time and headlines impact prices on a day to day basis assuming opec and its allies stay the course on production cuts until they are deemed to no longer be needed the primary downside risk in oil comes from the potential for a global recession and the negative impact that could have on demand longer term the potential for a us driven oversupply is also a risk on the other hand the upside to prices would likely be unexpected or worsening supply interruptions and a potential supply gap in the long term of course any of the wildcards discussed in this piece has the potential to contribute upside or downside pressure on prices footnotes 1 venezuelan oil production was 1 07 mmbpd in february a 540 000 bpd decrease from february 2018 2 the iea breaks out demand into oecd and non oecd demand there are 36 counties that belong to the organization for economic co operation and development oecd and these countries mostly represent advanced economies 3 in 2009 non oecd countries accounted for 46 5 of total global demand in 2018 non oecd countries represented 51 8 of demand

results comparable between periods a reconciliation of adjusted financial measures to the most directly comparable u s generally accepted accounting principles gaap measure is provided in the tables at the end of this release vernon j nagel chairman president and chief executive officer of acuity brands inc commented we are very pleased with our second quarter financial performance we achieved record second quarter net sales and adjusted diluted eps as well as improved operating profit margin by 40 basis points and adjusted operating profit margin by 50 basis points as compared with the year ago period although we believe second quarter revenue growth was negatively impacted by the pull forward of orders by customers into the first quarter in advance of price increases our net sales grew by almost 3 percent additionally our results for the second quarter were solid despite continuing inflationary cost pressures and the impact of tariffs we implemented several actions to address these cost issues including price increases and productivity improvements second quarter results the 2 7 percent year over year growth in fiscal 2019 second quarter net sales was due primarily to a sales volume increase of over 3 percent partially offset by a less than 1 percentage point of net unfavorable changes in product prices and mix of products sold price mix as the benefit from recently announced price increases was more than offset by changes primarily in sales channel mix and to a much lesser degree in the mix of products sold the realization from recent price increases was estimated to have contributed low single digit growth to overall net sales for the quarter also impacting second quarter net sales was a less than 1 percent favorable impact of acquired revenues from acquisitions net of lost revenues from divestitures which was largely offset by a combination of unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates and the impact of adoption of accounting standards codification 606 revenue from contracts with customers asc 606 fiscal 2019 second quarter results were impacted by the adoption of asc 606 which resulted in a decrease to revenues gross profit and operating profit of 1 6 million 1 1 million and 1 2 million respectively additionally fiscal 2018 results were restated to reflect the impact of adopting accounting standards update no 2017 07 compensation retirement benefits topic 715 improving the presentation of net table of contents 29 periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost asu 2017 07 upon adoption of asu 2017 07 prior year s second quarter reported operating profit and other expense both increased 1 5 million the provisions of asu 2017 07 had no impact to previously reported net income or earnings per share gross profit for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 decreased 0 6 million or 0 2 percent to 333 9 million compared with 334 5 million in the prior year period as the contribution from higher sales volume realized price increases and benefits from productivity improvements were offset by both a shift in key customers and changes in sales channel mix described below as well as higher input costs gross profit margin decreased 110 basis points to 39 1 percent for the quarter ended february 28 2019 compared with 40 2 percent in the prior year period the decline in gross profit margin was due primarily to a shift in sales among key customers within the retail channel as well as changes in sales channel mix although current quarter gross profit reflected a mix shift towards certain sales channels and customers that generate lower gross profit margins as compared with the company s historical consolidated gross profit margin profile the decline was generally offset by proportionally lower selling distribution and administrative sd a costs as freight and commissions associated with such sales were lower adjusted gross profit margin for the quarter ended february 28 2019 declined 100 basis points to 39 2 percent sd a expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 were 237 6 million compared with 244 4 million in the prior year period a decrease of 6 8 million or 2 8 percent the decrease in sd a expenses was due primarily to a decrease in freight and commission expense as well as certain cost containment and productivity improvements which were partially offset by higher cost to support the increase in net sales and to a lesser degree additional expenses associated with acquired businesses the decline in freight and commission expense was partially due to the customer shift within the retail sales channel as previously noted sd a expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 were 27 8 percent of net sales compared with 29 4 percent for the prior year period adjusted sd a expenses for the fiscal quarter ended february 28 2019 were 222 4 million or 26 0 percent of net sales compared with 229 2 million or 27 5 percent of net sales in the prior year period excluded from prior year s second quarter adjusted diluted eps of 1 89 was the aforementioned 0 75 benefit from 31 2 million of net discrete items associated with the tcja primarily due to a non cash income tax benefit from the remeasurement of the company s net u s deferred tax liabilities reflecting a reduced corporate federal rate partially offset by an unfavorable impact related to the taxation of the company s accumulated unremitted foreign earnings year to date results net sales for the first six months of fiscal 2019 increased approximately 7 percent to 1 79 billion compared with 1 67 billion for the prior year period the company reported 212 3 million of operating profit or 11 9 percent of net sales for the first half of fiscal 2019 compared with 209 7

streamlining activities and an income tax net benefit for discrete items associated with the tcja a reconciliation of adjusted financial measures to the most directly comparable u s gaap measure is provided in the tables at the end of this release net cash provided by operating activities totaled 188 3 million for the first half of fiscal 2019 compared with 177 6 million for the year ago period cash and cash equivalents at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2019 totaled 232 0 million an increase of 102 9 million since the beginning of the fiscal year during the first half of fiscal 2019 the company repurchased 0 4 million shares of its common stock under its previously authorized stock repurchase program at a total cost of 48 7 million and paid dividends to shareholders totaling 10 5 million outlook mr nagel commented we remain cautiously optimistic for the remainder of fiscal and calendar year 2019 and do not believe that the demand outlook has meaningfully changed from our outlook provided last quarter our wide and varied base of customers generally remains positive about current year growth prospects many customers continue to have record backlogs though they too are concerned about the timing of releases particularly for larger projects and the potential impact that tariffs and higher prices may have on overall demand third party forecasts and leading indicators continue to suggest that the north american lighting market our primary market should grow in the low single digit range in fiscal 2019 mr nagel continued our focus in fiscal 2019 is to garner additional top line growth driven primarily by outperforming the growth rates of the markets we serve through execution of our previously announced growth strategies improvement in the mix of products and solutions sold as we execute our tiered solutions strategy and leveraging our fixed cost infrastructure to achieve targeted incremental margins to improve our overall profitability the shift in sales among key customers within the retail channel could continue to have a dampening effect on gross profit dollars and gross profit margin but we expect this to be largely offset by lower freight and commission costs which are included in sd a expenses additionally in an effort to enhance our margin profile we have initiated a review of a small portion of our product portfolio and services offering with the objective of eliminating those items and activities that do not meet our return objectives mr nagel concluded we continue to believe the lighting and lighting related industry as well as building management systems have the potential to experience solid growth over the next decade particularly as owners and users of lighting equipment and buildings see the potential to transform those investments into strategic assets by deploying our distinctive solutions we believe we are uniquely positioned to fully participate in this exciting industry conference call as

image in a report titled the misery index 2018 authored by dr steve hanke of the johns hopkins university in baltimore maryland nigerians have been labelled the sixth most miserable people in the world the misery index was introduced in the 1970s by arthur okun an american economist author of the seminal work equality and efficiency the big trade off 1975 the original index considers such factors as unemployment rate and inflation rate it is a formula a methodology as it were consistent with what is known as okun s law but modified subsequently by harvard professor robert barro and professor steve hanke the latter releases a report annually he tells us that my modified misery index is the sum of the unemployment inflation and bank lending rates minus the percentage change in real gdp per capita higher readings on the first three elements are bad and make people miserable these are offset by a good gdp per capita growth which is subtracted from the sum of the bads a higher misery index score reflects a higher level of misery and it s a simple enough metric that a busy president without time for extensive economic briefings can understand at a glance in the 2018 report which is basically a forecast of what to expect in the year 2019 hanke identifies venezuela as the most miserable country in the world followed by zimbabwe argentina iran brazil turkey nigeria south africa bosnia herzegovina egypt and ukraine is nigeria the sixth most miserable country in the world where is syria south sudan somalia steve hanke s report does not necessarily cover all the countries of the world but certain points are clear from his submissions first the misery index makes the point very clear that economic growth is linked to the people s prosperity and happiness countries that suffer from stagflation are likely to have very miserable citizens second lack of economic growth or a poor economy can result in political and social crisis as we have seen in venezuela where inflation rate is said to be above 6 000 and zimbabwe where inflation is allegedly over 97 although this has been disputed in other evaluations which unlike hanke s index accommodate the employment rate in zimbabwe s informal economy third good governance leadership and political stability are important factors for macro economic growth the least miserable countries in the world as seen in the misery index 2018 would also seem to have strong leadership and institutions and a certain measure of stability fourth poverty should be avoided because it could lead to misery fifth the state has a responsibility to prevent the growth of poverty and promote economic growth it is important to break down and outline some of these well known elementary points because i see a tendency in this season to ignore external rankings or politicize them the people s democratic party pdp has already jumped on the back of the misery index to say that the report confirms the party s position that nigeria s economy has virtually collapsed under buhari the hanke index does not say that the nigerian economy has virtually collapsed it says the people are among the ten most miserable people in the world it is an economist s index not a political review nonetheless there are certain basics that should be established indeed unemployment rate in nigeria is about 23 10 per cent q3 2018 an all time high between 2006 and 2018 youth unemployment according to the national bureau of statistics nbs is even higher inflation rate is about 12 food inflation is higher at 13 5 recently the central bank of nigeria reduced monetary policy rate mpr to 13 5 down by 50 basis points from 14 nigeria s gdp growth is 1 8 compared to statistics from other parts of the world these nigerian statistics paint a gloomy picture unemployment rate in india for example is 6 1 canada 5 8 australia 4 9 united kingdom 3 9 germany 3 1 ghana 2 cote d ivoire 2 6 saudi arabia 12 7 etc there is also no doubt that the nigerian economy has gone through major contractions in the last five years the sharp drop in the spot price of oil depleted the country s reserves created a foreign exchange crisis and soon resulted in recession in 2016 nigeria faced the consequences of a negative growth of up to 2 3 in 2017 inflation was as high as 18 in september 2018 the economic intelligence unit of the economist magazine and the hsbc research unit predicted a gloomy economic prospect for nigeria in 2019 and also jumped into the troubled waters of analyzing nigerian politics with predictions about the likely outcome of the 2019 presidential election in nigeria both the ruling party in nigeria the all progressives congress apc and the nigerian government kicked they told the experts to keep their opinions to themselves the eiu hsbc in retrospect got the political analysis wrong pdp lost the 2019 presidential election apc won but the economic projections remain relevant and instructive the steve hanke misery index report may have been influenced by the eiu report rather than dismiss it however the central bank of nigeria cbn and the presidency hanke insists the message is so straightforward even a busy president can follow it should study the report and attend to the messages about economic growth and the careful management of certain indicators to deliver prosperity to the people nigeria s palace economists may quarrel over the statistics and the methodology but not the common sense but is hanke s description of nigeria as the 6thmost miserable country in the world accurate even if the nigerian economy has not virtually collapsed can misery be affirmed strictly on the basis of unemployment rate inflation rate and lending rates does poverty necessarily translate into misery is the correlation absolutely given nigeria ranks low in this 2019 misery index just as it ranks low on the human poverty index and the human development index these are challenges for governance and leadership but does all that mean that nigerians are miserable the word misery connotes unhappiness distress wretchedness hardship suffering affliction anguish sadness sorrow melancholy i think there are gaps in the hanke misery index in terms of the parameters adopted perhaps a more holistc assessment of the connection between economic growth and a people s response as individuals and communities may have shown that economic prosperity and growth do not necessarily guarantee a people s happiness there may well be more misery in all the developed countries of central europe taken together than may be in kenya or cape verde there are perhaps certain anthropological factors a certain kind of neuroscience that accounts for a people s happiness rather than cold macro economic statistics in 2011 nigeria was classified as the happiest place on earth in a gallup poll and its people as the most optimistic this was within the context of widespread underdevelopment and all forms of social sector crisis nigeria s status as a happy country was again confirmed in a world values survey in 2014 it is noteworthy however that in 2018 nigeria was listed as the 91sthappiest country in the world and the 5th happiest country in africa in the world happiness report obv iously so much happened negatively in nigeria between 2014 and 2018 but the sum indication is that as at 2018 nigerians were adjudged happier than they were between 2014 and 2016 how then can we suddenly become the sixth most miserable country in the world a year later the difference is who is looking at what the un 2019 happiness report for example focusses on the human being and community on relationships or the neuro science and the anthropology of happiness rather than economic indicators the world happiness report is more reflective of the nigerian situation in my view than the misery index we may have moved from being the happiest people on earth to the 91stin the world a reflection of the existential crisis that nigeria faces but the word misery does not quite capture the people s true essence my point is as follows the measurement of happiness or its antonym misery is perhaps more subjective and experiential than academic and statistical culture and context should matter nigeria has been described as one of the poorest countries in the world the country faces a problem of low level insurgency in the north east corruption is rife reports of all shades of violence are common place the country s wealth is concentrated in a few hands steady economic growth is a challenge but we the people are not in misery there may have been a slight increase in cases of suicide and depression in the country since 2015 but generally nigerians are a resilient lot the average nigerian is imbued with a fighting spirit if people in other countries go through what nigerians have gone through and are still going through such countries would have imploded but nigeria has not collapsed because the people s fighting spirit is unique in the midst of risks and vulnerability to poverty due to economic mismanagement by nigeria s leaders the average nigerian continues to forge ahead these are people who don t give up easily they believe that tomorrow will be better when they are faced with election rigging voter intimidation outright theft of public resources these are people who are likely to say is it not four years let them come and do what they want to do and go away when people get killed and are abandoned by the roadside you d be surprised that with the corpses lying in open spaces some nigerians can just pull seats together and begin to have a drink a few metres away from a decaying body there is no weekend when there is no celebratory feast in a nigerian community flashy attires expensive cars exotic drinks musicians waxing lyrical and the men and women dancing away with no care in the world i do not know any other country in the world where the parties and celebrations are as elaborate as the parties we throw in nigeria the misery index is talking about high unemployment rates in nigeria this is true but the people are so resilient they manage to get by they have learnt to move beyond their governments nigeria is the biggest market in africa those who cannot get formal jobs find other things to do come to lagos dr hanke some of the young ladies you would see on the streets of lagos and on nigerian instagram are from very poor backgrounds and they have no extra ordinary skills but you are likely to see them driving expensive cars wearing bespoke clothes the type that kim kardashian cannot even afford this is the small girl big god generation that puts a lie to all that talk about misery in nigeria besides thuggery and cultism are considered professions in nigeria and regarded as more profitable and influential than medicine law or engineering thugs and cultists are patronized by political leaders and they are well paid for their efforts particularly during election seasons it is only in nigeria i guess that a security guard earning less than a 100 a month will have three wives and 10 children while his own employer will be struggling to maintain a family of four it is also in nigeria that you will find a civil servant having five wives and two concubines even when he has not been paid a salary for 24 months misery professor steve hanke is an applied economist he may not have visited some of the countries covered by his study but in the case of nigeria he should not rely on textbook statistics unemployment rate lending rate inflation rate gdp per capita may make sense to the economists but those things sound like voodoo to the average nigerian the people live in a zone that is beyond theory the average nigerian is not intimidated by the gap between the very rich and the very poor for him or her there is a religious rather a spiritual side to this thing called poverty or inequality the nigerian is told by the large population of prosperity evangelists in the country muslim christian and animist that he or she can become rich overnight in nigeria you can see a man as poor as a church rat in january and by december he has a mansion in his village attended to by a retinue of hangers on all very happy and he too has become an employer of labour and he is likely to pay salaries more regularly than government nigeria is the ultimate headquarters of trade offs not even arthur m okun could have imagined that the nigerian character and attitude both raise questions about the true nature of work employment economic growth or the meaning of misery beyond the theories and forecasts the other question is what is the integrity of the applied data
this report contains a correction see also fact sheet toward a robust competition policy by marc jarsulic ethan gurwitz and andrew schwartz executive summary the share of corporations earning profits above competitive levels has risen since the late 1970s large firms in many sectors especially in communication services health care and information technology it now have market power that allows them to maintain prices above competitive levels this has important implications for the u s economy which is largely governed through market competition when firms are earning economic rents returns to capital beyond what a competitive market would normally allow income is redistributed upward to owners the economic rents that flow to these owners function like a tax on everyone else lowering real wages and shifting overall income shares away from workers this site is protected by recaptcha and the google privacy policy and terms of service apply moreover because firms earn rent when entry by competitors is inhibited the economy becomes less dynamically efficient when there are no entry barriers high rates of profit attract new firms increasing supply and eventually reducing price when barriers exist investment capital does not flow to its most profitable use and potential gains in productivity can be squandered this report identifies several factors apart from the development of technical superiority that are creating entry barriers these include the ability of firms to merge and increase market concentration the increased importance of intellectual property rights the development of businesses where network externalities are significant and differential access to big sets of data on consumers this report also recommends a range of policy changes that can reduce these barriers to entry and support increased competition among firms these policies include changes to antitrust policy and enforcement changes to the rules thcat govern intellectual property and measures to increase access to important types of data recognizing that the implementation of some or all of these policies may provide incomplete solutions to competition problems the authors also explain how a monopoly tax levied on companies that earn profits in uncompetitive markets could reduce the incentive to create market power and limit the revenues that can be used to sustain existing entry barriers although there are many sources of competitive distortions and any action taken to address them will require careful consideration there is little doubt that changes to competition policy are in order and can substantially improve the operation of the u s economy overview entry barriers are raising many u s corporations profits market economies rely on the entry of new firms to ensure competitive results when profits in an industry are relatively high and markets are functioning effectively new firms have an incentive to enter in order to capture some of those profits this in turn increases supply lowers prices and reduces the rate of return under competitive conditions in which investment flows to the economic activity with the highest rate of return the expectation is that rates of profit on invested capital will converge across firms and industries to a common equilibrium value when there are barriers to entry that is when something prevents new firms from increasing supply in an industry where profits are high this process is frustrated incumbent firms protected by entry barriers benefit from higher than normal profits but these gains come at the expense of their customers in addition incumbent firms have a reduced incentive to innovate and have a strong incentive to defend their market power thus some of the long term benefits of competitive markets are lost there is now strong evidence that barriers to entry have a significant effect on many sectors of the u s economy measures to evaluate firm level economic performance indicate that many firms have market power and are earning profits above competitive levels for a significant number of firms the ratio of a firm s market value to the replacement cost of its capital has risen to well above 1 this indicates that firms are able to extract economic rent meaning that they are able to net incomes exceed competitive levels see text box on tobin s q below the share of large firms earning rents has risen since the late 1970s along with the share of rents in total corporate profits this could not happen without the existence of powerful entry barriers several factors have created entry barriers although some of the barriers to entry are the result of production techniques or organizational structures that cannot be replicated across firms there are other important causes among them is ineffective antitrust enforcement which has allowed concentration to rise through mergers and acquisitions evidence shows that increases in concentration are often accompanied by increased prices moreover incumbent firms with market power have been allowed to use acquisitions to fend off potential competition rules protecting intellectual property also create obvious entry barriers and play an important role in sectors such as communication services pharmaceuticals and it network externalities which are increasingly important in software and it based business also create barriers they exist when the benefits that an individual derives from a good increase when others decide to use it creating additional incentive for others to buy the good telephones word processors and social media platforms produce these externalities as increased usage results in a positive feedback loop when network effects are significant individual users will be reluctant to switch to a competitor even if it is superior this creates a lock in effect and a barrier to entry for new firms differential access to big data on consumer behavior also appears to play an important role in reducing entry and competition data are crucial and valuable inputs to many digital businesses many of which are constantly updating information based on the behaviors and interests of their users because these data are generated in part by the free or subsidized services that these firms provide to users potential entrants are at a significant disadvantage these entrants are less likely to become competitors if they lack crucial inputs for machine learning and the development of artificial intelligence ai which have become increasingly important to digital business changes in policy can reduce barriers to entry changes to antitrust policy and enforcement rising market power is in part attributable to a decline in effective antitrust enforcement beginning in the 1980s when the indicators of increased market power first emerged antitrust regulators permitted many mergers which has led to increased market concentration and price increases antitrust agencies also appear to have missed the effects of allowing top firms to acquire potential competitors that could erode their dominance many of these dominant firms already benefit from entry barriers this report proposes a prohibition on mergers and acquisitions by firms already protected by entry barriers as well as limits on operations by these firms in adjacent markets changes to intellectual property protection because public investment in basic research is often the basis for patent protected intellectual property this report identifies a variety of potential measures to reduce the barriers created by patent rules these include granting government entities the so called golden shares or decisive voting power for products made possible by public investment requiring licensing of patents with a public component and introducing prizes to support innovation not accompanied by patent protection open data standards where data are competitively significant building on a consumer financial protection bureau cfpb guideline that suggested banks share financial information with other institutions when their customers requested that they do so the authors of this report propose similar rules open data standards and data portability to allow users of digital platforms to switch easily when they wish additionally the government should facilitate open data clearinghouses analogous to weather data which government sources provide to the public to house publicly collected data that could be used in data intensive areas such as ai the report also advocates for a requirement that users be allowed to communicate across social media platforms in much the same way that telephone subscribers can reach parties who are served by different telephone companies when barriers remain a monopoly tax can help level the competitive playing field because it may not be possible to reduce barriers for all firms and across all industries and because changes in fundamental policies such as antitrust and intellectual property rules may be difficult and time consuming to implement the report also proposes a monopoly tax to reduce the flow of rents to large firms instituting a monopoly tax would have three effects while such a tax would not directly aid new firm entry it would reduce the flow of economic rents making these revenues available for public purposes without harming efficiency it would also discourage further efforts to enhance market power through actions such as mergers and acquisitions moreover a monopoly tax would diminish the ability of firms with market power to use their outsize returns to influence political and regulatory outcomes evidence of significant barriers to entry and rising corporate rents there is now significant evidence that the competitive environment in the u s economy has changed dramatically since the late 1970s with a significant share of corporations earning returns that exceed competitive levels under competitive conditions in which capital owners with funds to invest maximize their profits and there are no barriers that prevent these funds from flowing to the projects with the highest rates of return it is expected that rates of profit on invested capital will converge across firms and industries to a common equilibrium value the logic behind this expectation is simple supranormal rates of return in any line of business create the incentive for their own elimination since profit maximizing investors will have extra incentive to enter that business replicate the productive process used by incumbent firms and earn some of the higher profits for themselves entry should continue until the effects of increasing supply reduce prices and eliminate rents that is to say the difference between competitive and supranormal profits 1 the q ratio using stock market valuations to determine when firms are earning monopoly profits in a competitive stock market the value of a firm will be equal to the present value of its net revenues if the market value exceeds the replacement cost of a firm s capital there is an obvious way for a new entrant to make money a new entrant would gain from purchasing an additional unit of capital and using it to produce the same good as the incumbent firm this is because the new entrant would earn an immediate financial reward the difference between the market value and replacement cost to put it another way entry is encouraged by the existence of an arbitrage opportunity arbitrage opportunities exist when it is possible to buy a good in one market in this case the market for capital goods and sell it for a higher price in another market the arbitrage is between the capital goods market and the equity market or buying a unit of capital goods at its current replacement cost and reselling it for more in the equity market by putting it to work in the appropriate line of business of course entry will increase the supply of goods this should reduce the price of the firm s output and therefore also reduce the net revenue from every unit of capital used in that line of business this phenomenon makes entry a self limiting process entry will continue until net revenue per unit falls to the level of replacement cost per unit of capital at this point no incentive for additional entry exists and the incumbent firm is then earning the competitive rate of return on its capital thus when there are no barriers to entry the stock market value of a firm v will be equal to the replacement cost of its capital rc however entry barriers can make it possible for a firm to earn more than the competitive rate of return on its capital the existence of such barriers means that the ability of new firms to increase supply can be imperfect and the return to capital for an incumbent firm can remain above the competitive level when its rate of return exceeds the competitive level a firm is said to be earning an economic rent when a firm s net earnings include rent those supranormal revenues will be included in the stock market valuation of the firm after all stock market participants do not care about the source of net revenues only that they exist this suggests a way to use stock market valuations and the replacement cost of capital stock to construct a measure that can signal when a firm is earning rent when there are no entry barriers the market value of the firm will equal the replacement cost of its capital stock v rc when q v rc is greater than 1 the firm is earning returns that exceed competitive levels the ratio q is referred to as tobin s q after the economist james tobin who introduced its use in economics the excess of market valuation over replacement cost provides a quantitative measure of the rent component of net revenue conceptually v v k v r where v k is the discounted value of the competitive return to capital and v r is the discounted value of rents thus it follows that q v rc v k rc v r rc 1 v r rc hence the excess of q over 1 is then a measure of rents relative to replacement cost if for example q 2 half of the earnings of the firm are from economic rent 2 there is now evidence that in the aggregate the share of rents in corporate income is positive and has trended upward since the late 1970s to visualize this consider the ratio of the equity market value of corporations to the replacement cost of the physical and intangible capital stock that they employ this ratio called tobin s q should be equal to 1 under competitive market conditions however q values for many nonfinancial corporations have been trending upward since the late 1970s and are now significantly greater than 1 using firm level data from a large sample of publicly traded u s corporations for the period 1975 2015 excluding regulated utilities financial firms public service firms and some others economists ryan h peters and lucian a taylor construct measures of firm level q values these measures include the replacement costs of both tangible and intangible capital 3 the average and 90th percentile values of the peters taylor q ratios are presented graphically in figure 1 q values greater than 1 suggest that the rent component or excess profit of total u s corporate income is now quite large applying a model based approach to national income accounts data economist simcha barkai reaches a similar conclusion for the nonfinancial corporate sector as a whole 4 without the presence of barriers to entry this change in q values is difficult to explain the existence of rents should provide a strong incentive for the entry of new competitors and rising rents should provide increasingly strong incentives as well however the expected competitive mechanism does not appear to be functioning this interpretation of the data is supported by the fact that it has become easier for firms to earn rents in successive years figure 2 displays the share of firms in the peters taylor sample with a q greater than 1 in one year that maintained a q greater than 1 in the next year this number rises from around 10 percent of firms in 1980 to around 40 percent of firms in 2015 suggesting increased inertia around rent extraction in other words it has become more likely that a firm that earns measurable rent will be able to do so in a subsequent year this is consistent with the expected effects of a decline in competition there are also various other data from across the economy that point to reduced competition see text box below a substantial set of indicators points to rising market power firm markups the ratio of price to the marginal cost of production have risen substantially since the 1980s 5 the 90 50 ratio for corporate returns the accounting return on invested capital for the 90th percentile of firms to the 50th percentile has increased from around 2 in 1980 to around 10 in 2014 6 corporate profits are concentrated in a declining number of firms 7 overall market concentration has increased over the past several decades 8 the rate of entry of new firms across the economy has been declining since the late 1970s 9 rising concentration among employers is associated with job lock and weak wage growth 10 there is of course heterogeneity in the relative market power of firms while the mean value of q has trended upward q values for many firms reflect competitive returns figure 3 shows the distribution of q values for individual firms in the peters taylor sample averaged across 1981 1985 and 2011 2015 both mean and median values have shifted right and the right hand tail of the distribution is more heavily populated but many firms have q values at or below 1 11 there is also evidence of differing degrees of market power across sectors of the economy figure 4 displays the average q values for the 200 largest u s corporations by market capitalization in the peters taylor sample sorted into several broad global industry classification standard sectors 12 while there was a general upward trend in q values across most sectors during the years 1981 1985 and 2011 2015 not all sectors ended the period with values significantly larger than 1 it should be noted that a decline in competition is very likely not the sole explanation for the rise in observable corporate rent many economists have recognized that worker bargaining power has also diminished since the 1970s a result of the decline in union representation weakening of workforce protections the decline in the real value of the minimum wage and increased wage competition caused by expanding global competition all of which have contributed to the rise in corporate rent a recent paper by economic policy institute economists josh bivens and heidi shierholz summarizes this case nicely 13 in an economy where competition is imperfect the division of corporate net returns depends on how much power workers have to bargain for them 14 therefore the observable rise in corporate rent may well reflect the concurrent decline in worker bargaining power 15 the fact that these rents have not been competed away however even as they rise measurably means that competitive entry is frustrated but the authors do not attempt to estimate the quantitative contribution of each factor to the measured rise in economic rents 16 moreover persistent rents have dynamic implications when rents are significant incumbent firms have good reason to defend them this can lead these firms to take economic legal or political steps to prevent the entry of new competitors which as a consequence may prevent innovative products and processes from disrupting the marketplace 17 high rents can also deter incumbents from focusing their own efforts on developing and investing in innovation the marked decline in nonfinancial corporate capital investment relative to corporate net income since 2000 is certainly consistent with rising market power 18 in the next section of the report the authors identify potential barriers to competition that ought to be examined as sources of rising corporate rent the report then discusses policy proposals that might reduce those barriers and explains why these policies should be augmented with a monopoly tax that will reduce corporate rent sources of entry barriers it is easy to think of ways in which normal competition can create barriers to entry that inhibit the equalization of profits such as through the development of a significant new product or a more efficient production process for an existing product could certainly do it as long as production techniques cannot be replicated new entrants are either totally excluded or forced to earn lower rates of return some economists have pointed to technical superiority as a potential explanation for the rise in rents and increases in concentration 19 however these types of barriers to entry should often be transient human beings are very good at imitation and reverse engineering there is no good reason to believe that we have become less capable since 1980 it is implausible to attribute widespread rising rents exclusively to new products and new processes that cannot be replicated hence we must look for other factors that can help explain why barriers appear to have increased over time ineffective antitrust enforcement rising market power is in part attributable to the declining effectiveness of antitrust enforcement beginning in the 1980s intentional policy decisions have hindered antitrust enforcement regulators largely abandoned challenges of mergers where market concentration was below the upper threshold of what is considered to be competitive 20 similarly they became increasingly reluctant to bring unilateral conduct cases leading to an environment in which dominant firms could aggressively pursue anticompetitive conduct such as foreclosure without legal repercussions 21 a recent empirical study by economist john kwoka presents convincing evidence that merger enforcement decisions allowing increased concentration have often led to price increases 22 a 2016 study by economist robert kulick which looked at establishment level data of cement producers from 1977 through 1992 also found significant price increases due to horizontal mergers after a relaxation in antitrust enforcement standards in the mid 1980s but no evidence of systematic price increases before 23 firms enjoying the gains created by entry barriers have every incentive to maintain and expand them one excellent way to do so made possible by large flows of rent is to acquire potential competitors before they can fully establish themselves 24 there is evidence that pharmaceutical companies have used so called killer acquisitions to discontinue innovations at target companies in order to pre empt competition and preserve revenue from existing investments 25 this same motive along with a desire to provide complements to goods and services that already produce network externalities appears to generate some acquisitions in the software and it services industries there are signs that early stage and startup companies and their venture capital funders do not mind being acquired by dominant firms the number of companies that go public on an annual basis has dropped off considerably since peaking in the late 1990s 26 the acquisitions of waze youtube and deepmind by google27 and instagram and whatsapp by facebook28 all appeared to be at a large premium to existing revenue and to strengthen the dominance of the acquiring firms 29 these and other acquisitions have not been subject to antitrust challenges the contributing role of weak antitrust enforcement to rising rents is further supported by the fact that rising market power is disproportionately prevalent in the united states returns on equity among u s based firms dwarf those of corresponding non u s firms 30 similarly since the mid 1990s the united states has experienced highly irregular drops in the number of publicly listed firms generally a country s largest firms relative to other developed countries primarily driven by the united states unique and rapid increase in mergers and acquisitions 31 in contrast due to improved antitrust enforcement in recent decades european markets have less concentration lower rents and fewer barriers to entry all without sacrificing innovation 32 finally as thomas piketty and gabriel zucman s 2014 data show q values in the united states have risen more intensively than in many other developed countries starting in the 1980s 33 strategic behavior to support entry barriers rent seeking firms can use the regulatory and political system to protect their rents as economist luigi zingales notes a firm s size and the level of concentration within a market affect positively all the crucial factors that determine a firm s ability to influence the political system 34 as firms grow they work to protect their advantages this leads to further political investment and in turn more political power the benefits of this political influence can include a sustained ability to extract rents the u s telecommunications sector recently won several regulatory victories that are likely to aid in rent extraction 35 the federal communication commission s fcc rollback of net neutrality allows internet service providers isps to set up a previously prohibited price discrimination market 36 isps are now allowed to prioritize content providers that are willing to pay a fee the likely result is higher consumer costs and greater rents for isps who already have near monopoly positions 37 in 2017 using the congressional review act congressional republicans passed a resolution subsequently signed by president donald trump nullifying a rule that strictly limited the ability of isps to sell customers personal information 38 other examples can be found in the pharmaceutical industry for example biologic therapies drugs created using live cells make up a significant share of pharmaceutical spending in part due to a lack of competition to combat these rapidly rising costs the obama administration created incentives within medicare to entice hospitals to prescribe the cheapest biosimilar or generic biologic drug 39 however the trump administration recently rescinded this rule after intense lobbying by biologic drug manufacturers with the wall street journal noting that the rollback could drive up prices of certain biologic drugs 40 it should come as no surprise to learn that the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america set a new record for lobbying in 2018 with spending reaching 27 5 million 41 economists german gutiérrez and thomas philippon recently made the case that corporate capture of u s antitrust enforcement explains much of the state of u s competition comparing the markets of the united states with those of europe the authors find that the european economy is more competitive 42 they conclude that the most compelling culprit is not technology and efficient scale but a form of corporate capture that is more prevalent in the united states than in europe due to institutional choices 43 in a related study authors mihir mehta suraj srinivasan and wanli zhao looked at a sample of u s mergers between 1998 and 2010 documenting how political connections affected antitrust outcomes 44 and found evidence of corporate influence on mergers policy even under increased public and political scrutiny tech firms continue to spend significant amounts of money to lobby congress and federal agencies facebook apple google amazon and microsoft spent a combined 64 3 million on political lobbying in 2018 alone 45 increased use of intellectual property protection intellectual property protection a source of state sanctioned monopoly power is playing an increasingly important role in the u s economy because of changes to the patent system since the 1980s patents have become easier to obtain and enforce and the rewards for enforcement claims have increased 46 beginning around 1980 there has been a significant increase in patent awards both in absolute numbers and relative to total output see figure 5 in addition as economist dean baker has emphasized the bayh dole act of 1980 made it possible for private actors to obtain patent rights for publicly funded inventions such as medicines that are based on science funded by the national institute of health 47 patents of course can be imperfect entry barriers a potential entrant can invent around license or dispute patents legally however there is evidence that patents create effective barriers in important parts of the economy such as in the pharmaceutical industry even though the production of drugs requires technical expertise and the ability to meet rigorous standards set by the u s food and drug administration brand name drugs can be copied relatively quickly by generic drug manufacturers when patents expire and generic drugs are brought to market the price of drugs typically drops dramatically once there is more than one generic competitor 48 patents are also crucial in complex technology areas where so called patent thickets portfolios of patents with overlapping claims held by incumbent firms create barriers to entry for instance in the u s software industry as the number of patents held by incumbent firms rises there is a statistically significant decline in the number of entrants 49 data from the united kingdom are consistent with this finding an empirical study of firm decisions to patent for the first time in a given technology area shows a substantial and statistically significant negative relationship between the density of patent thickets and the likelihood of patenting in a new area 50 network externalities some goods produce network externalities which exist when the benefits that an individual derives from a good increase when others decide to use it in turn creating additional incentive for others to buy it 51 a classic example is the telephone network the more individuals join the network the more valuable a telephone network becomes and the more incentive others have to join however network effects can create barriers to entry when an existing good succeeds in generating very high levels of externalities and that good is incompatible with competing goods individual users will be reluctant to switch to the competitor even when it is superior this is the so called lock in effect this lock in effect can be overcome with coordinated action by the network adopters but coordination can be costly and imperfect 52 as howard shelanski a former fcc chief economist put it the network feedback and lock in effects that can arise in platform markets might provide real benefits to consumers but also entrench market power in a platform that gains the lead in its relevant markets 53 the sources of network effects can be quite varied when there are economies of scale when firms average costs fall as their output increases and those cost decreases are reflected in the price of the good then the pricing creates a network effect network effects can also be enhanced when there are complements to the network for example software that is compatible with an operating system or type of computer hardware or when there are significant transactions costs to switching to an alternative silicon valley veterans have emphasized the importance of increasing returns to scale for software and it services peter thiel and reid hoffman well known it investors argued that the central idea to most silicon valley companies is to hit escape velocity as thiel said he benefit is that you re achieving escape velocity from the black hole that is hyper competition 54 this theory said hoffman is the central idea that has driven nearly every successful scale company 55 scale for instance appears to have been an important factor in microsoft s acquisition of linkedin linkedin a company with a 25 billion market capitalization had been struggling with how to compete in light of what its ceo called a redefinition of scale in the modern world 56 as the entrepreneur and writer tim o reilly later acknowledged linkedin was not big enough to be competitive as a standalone company in today s market 57 potential entrants also recognize the importance of scale as in the ad technology market with the rise of google and facebook according to mary meeker of the venture capital firm kleiner perkins google and facebook made up three quarters of all new ad spending in 2016 and more than half of the u s digital ad market in 2017 58 as venture capitalist suranga chandratillake noted even if you manage to build a sustainable advantage for a few years how do you scale to compete with google or facebook that s why traditional adtech does feel dead from a venture perspective 59 the importance of having complements to the network good is also well established the u s department of justice s successful case against microsoft argued that by taking steps against netscape a browser designed to work across operating systems the company was illegally acting to preserve the barrier to entry created by the willingness of programmers to make windows compatible applications its first priority 60 access to data data are crucial and valuable inputs to many digital businesses firms such as google facebook and amazon are constantly updating information based on the behaviors and interests of their users data are frequently locked up in closed systems or limited through intellectual property protections and for good reason as lawyers maurice stucke and allen grunes wrote if personal data were as freely available as sunshine companies would not spend a considerable amount of money offering free services to acquire and analyze data to maintain a data related competitive advantage 61 a 2016 mckinsey company survey of u s auto industry executives found that firms prioritize their r d efforts and m a strategy on the basis of the expected growth in their data assets base 62 yet even when data can be purchased it is not always the case that a sufficient repository can be built from third party data sets 63 as economist joshua gans explains a firm s monopolization of data could harm consumers if it confers an incumbency advantage supported by barriers to entry that reduces the incentives for competing platforms to enter a particular market 64 one particularly valuable use of data is in machine learning and the development of ai the continuous and growing complexity of tasks that ai has to master requires large repositories of data on which to train algorithms 65 professors eric posner and glen weyl argue that the vast data sets collected by google facebook and others as a by product of their core business functions became a crucial source of revenue and competitive advantage 66 they make the case that data used for machine learning may have increasing returns to scale in that more complex tasks that require deeper learning are often more valuable 67 data access leads to material product improvements including personalization and algorithm optimization 68 which result in efficiencies increased productivity and better customer targeting 69 such outcomes often benefit consumers 70 but these dynamics can also make it harder for new entrants to compete 71 as firms scale and bring in more and better data they become better performers if it is hard to access the data or an equivalent source replicating existing firms performance becomes exceedingly difficult 72 because data are generated in part through the network effects of free services provided to users other services are often unable to acquire the same information 73 economists di he and others provide empirical support for this theory finding that having more historical data improves search engine performance as measured by ranking quality and learning speeds 74 this data feedback effect ensures that incumbent firms extend their lead over new entrants over time 75 data may also make it easier for dominant firms to enter adjacent markets 76 the european commission has labeled this concentric diversification wherein companies expand their data collection analytics into adjacent data areas where joint analysis of the existing and additional data gives them a comparative advantage over companies that separately analyze data in a particular area 77 amazon for example has unique knowledge about not just supply chains but also customers and the marketplace for goods 78 using its knowledge of customer locations from shipping addresses and purchasing patterns the company is expanding its advertising business now with an estimated worth of 125 billion 79 amazon has also built a robust private label business using its proprietary sales and search data 80 a similar example can be found in the health care industry google which dominates the search engine market is now applying its machine learning algorithms to health care markets seeing the sector as holding commercial promise 81 recommendations policies to reduce entry barriers and increase competition this section identifies a range of policies that have the potential to reduce entry barriers and make it less likely that corporations can extract rents over a prolonged period of time increase antitrust enforcement some robust policy tools for encouraging competition already exist the u s department of justice and the federal trade commission have considerable authority to limit and in some cases reverse mergers limits on acquisitions traditional merger review remains heavily focused on calculable price and efficiency effects hence it may be difficult for antitrust authorities to view the acquisition of startups with small revenue streams and little or no market capitalization as anti competitive however when network effects or other factors already protect an incumbent firm from competition a seemingly harmless acquisition may have a significant effect on protecting or expanding entry barriers for digital companies the size of the target firm s user base the speed at which the startup is growing and the potential uses of its data are only a few of the indicators that may signal to the incumbent that the target is a potential competitive threat or that incorporation of its product will help deter future competitors an acquisition at what appears to be a very high financial premium reflects the present value of the company as well as the future value of maintaining a barrier against competition economists timothy f bresnahan and shane greenstein argue we should not be surprised that an industry as inventive and important as computing throws up new challenges to the analysis of industry structure and of competition 82 antitrust authorities appear to have missed these strategic issues facebook for example acquired instagram and whatsapp without challenge from antitrust agencies 83 with both acquisitions antitrust enforcers determined that there were sufficient substitutes for advertisers and user data 84 and yet as others have noted facebook considered both companies to be existential threats to its business model 85 with the benefit of hindsight permitting these acquisitions may have foreclosed the entry of potentially powerful competitors instagram and whatsapp are doing remarkably well even as they continue to function largely independently of facebook 86 instagram for example boasts 1 billion users continues to experience rapid growth and generates high revenue 87 moreover instagram users spend a similar amount of time on the application as they do on facebook 88 in light of the above example it may make sense to challenge acquisitions by dominant firms already protected by significant entry barriers this idea is not exactly novel in a 1968 paper judge richard posner floated the concept of merger bans for natural monopolies 89 considering the structure for how these firms gain market power 90 such a ban appears to be an effective way to prevent strategic anti competitive behavior on the part of incumbents and would increase incentives for them to focus on internal innovation 91 federal trade commission ftc commissioner rohit chopra has recently argued that the ftc has broad rule making authority to prohibit unfair competition under section 5 of the federal trade commission act 92 this underused provision of the law might provide an avenue to implement such a ban limits on operation in adjacent markets when network externalities or other factors create barriers similar to those surrounding natural monopolies expansion into related markets can sustain or increase those barriers as economist jean tirole notes it is important to ensure that the existence of a natural monopoly at one point in the value chain does not turn the whole sector into a monopoly if there is a danger of that happening it may be desirable to further separate the service from the infrastructure to allow fair competition in the potentially competitive segments 93 there are at least two ways that this could be done regulation of firm conduct in adjacent markets or structural separation between the dominant firm and adjacent markets the rules implementing the principle of net neutrality which until recently governed all internet service providers illustrate the operation of regulation 94 these rules prohibited discrimination against or unfair prioritization of any content by isps the isps were permitted to own content but could not treat others content differently such an approach could be applied to any market where a firm that functions as a market maker or so called platform also participates in the market it organizes or facilitates while the market maker would still be able to compete its actions would be constrained to preserve competition in adjacent markets for example google would be constrained in prioritizing adjacent sites such as google shopping within its search interface 95 the second approach is to prohibit the dominant firm in a particular market from operating in any adjacent market the idea recently advanced by lawyer lina khan is to structurally separate the natural monopoly from complementary services or applications such a firewall would obviate the need for regulatory oversight of the platform s conduct 96 as khan notes structural separations are not without precedent having been used in both the banking and transportation sectors one such example comes from the bell telephone system s 1956 consent decree with the u s department of justice which prohibited operation outside telecommunications khan applies her approach to amazon arguing that the operator of a market should not also be allowed to compete against merchants that rely on that market amazonbasics the firm s store brand does this by offering items that compete with goods offered by third parties on amazon marketplace another example is google shopping services the european commission s case against google argued that the search engine artificially prioritized its product ahead of other rival services that rely on fair ordering 97 in this sense prioritization by google may be seen as unfair use of its dominant position structural separations would restrict this conduct by not permitting the firm to operate adjacent services limit intellectual property generated monopoly power in important sectors of the economy such as pharmaceuticals and it patent protection appears to contribute to high levels of rent extraction the federal government could take several steps to reduce rents while also preserving incentives to innovate leverage government expenditures across sectors public funding heavily subsidizes private research and development r d in her book the entrepreneurial state mariana mazzucato shows how companies from apple to google have benefited from public investment 98 she profiles the iphone making the case that the origins of its most critical innovations including gps the internet and touch screen technologies were born of publicly funded research this is also true in the pharmaceutical sector from 2008 to 2014 the industry received 28 billion in public funding access to public research institutions and r d and orphan drug tax credits 99 one study by economists bhaven n sampat and frank r lichtenberg found that between 1988 and 2005 40 percent of groundbreaking therapies called priority review drugs cited at least one public sector patent and nearly one fifth had a public sector patent 100 the federal government could leverage the value of its contributions to either reduce or recoup some of this rent one approach would be to prevent rents from being accrued in the first place health policy expert ezekiel emanuel for example has proposed replicating the swedish government s practice of setting a value based price ceiling on drugs this would permit buyers to negotiate with drug companies over prices as they do now but there would be a ceiling to prevent prices from becoming unsustainable 101 another ex ante approach would be for the government to shorten the duration of patent protection while firms might respond by increasing prices during their government issued monopoly a shorter period of exclusivity granted under patent protection could limit much of the pernicious effects seen today including reduced innovation slower entry of new firms and high rental income the government could also recoup the rent after it has been made mazzucato argues that the public should receive golden shares or royalties in cases where public investment has been used 102 these returns would go back to the u s department of the treasury to fund further innovation 103 alternatively drug companies in particular could adopt a version of a medical loss ratio in the case that firms raise prices substantially above fair value such as a drug with minimal time left under patent the ratio would require the firm to reinvest that revenue to fund further research 104 finally the government could reform current royalty frameworks to ensure that the public receives a larger return when innovation that relied on government funding is commercialized in such cases this may deter price increases or ensure that society is benefiting a tougher lever has been floated by professors amy kapczynski and aaron s kesselheim they call for the novel use of a longtime statutory provision in 28 u s c section 1498 which covers patent and copyright cases this provision enables the federal government to procure a patented innovation based on a reasonable rate of return the equivalent of eminent domain 105 kapczynski and kesselheim suggest applying this lever to pharmaceuticals where the price of the drug far exceeds a fair profit and where greater access to the drug is paramount 106 importantly this lever can be used regardless of whether the government played any role in the innovation to develop the drug require compulsory licensing another promising approach is compulsory licensing combined with rules governing access to an incumbent firm s essential infrastructure 107 a form of compulsory licensing has been used before in 1956 bell labs which had a monopoly over telecommunications agreed to a consent decree with the u s department of justice following an antitrust case premised on monopolization as part of the remedy bell which had the most advanced private research lab in america was forced to license patents without royalties 108 a 2017 study by martin watzinger found that the decree led to a large and long lasting increase in the number of citations to bell patents especially by small and young firms 109 in this same spirit in sectors with persistently high q values owing to patent protections remedies could include required patent licensing this could precede a patent s designation regulators could establish a fair reasonable and nondiscriminatory term or a ceiling as a condition for receiving a patent 110 this could also occur after the fact much as it did in the bell case finally the government presently has what are termed march in rights as part of the 1980 bayh dole act march in rights can compel the licensing of a private patent that has benefited from public research to date such rights have never been used 111 yet as sampat and lichtenberg point out he government could theoretically exercise march in authority or use a recoupment policy for as much as 20 percent of the high priority drugs developed through the 1990s 112 several have called for reforms to bayh dole to make sure such authorities become more administrable 113 others have called for further pro competitive changes such as making sure publicly funded innovation is not exclusively licensed 114 increase public investment the u s government needs to substantially increase basic research in high value high growth sectors whereas private funding understandably rarely goes to long term bets public r d have a rich track record of positive spillovers that enhance private sector competition and enable the united states to stay competitive with rival countries of growing innovative capacity 115 since 2010 there has been a declining level of public investment in r d funding levels dropped by nearly 15 percent over the past decade totaling about 143 billion in fiscal year 2018 116 a related approach is to consider awarding prizes rather than monopoly power for innovations the idea of prizes has a long legacy economist joseph stiglitz for instance has called for the creation of a prize fund in tandem with a patent system 117 when a prize is awarded the innovator makes an immediate and large return but has little ability to dictate price or access prizes could preserve incentives to invent without the promise of monopoly power as an example stiglitz discusses pill prizes awarded to pharmaceutical companies that invent a drug to cure a disease the challenge with prizes is defining the objective and certifying it has been met similarly there would need to be a process for commercializing the findings not a trivial task 118 increase data sharing access to large quantities of relevant data has important competitive effects data access allows for deeper understanding of customer preferences and behaviors creates network effects and can ease entry into new markets 119 the centralization of data ownership among a few companies makes it harder for smaller firms and startups to compete the authors of this report propose three policy approaches to increase data sharing improve policymakers understanding of the resource reduce consumer switching costs and require data sharing through application programming interfaces clearinghouses or open standards conduct data retrospectives enforcement agencies have periodically performed retrospective reviews to assess merger policy effectiveness with the most recent review published in 2017 120 a similar review should occur for mergers where data are a strategic asset an increasingly frequent occurrence this idea was first proposed by allen stucke and maurice grunes who made clear that agencies while predicting a proposed merger s likely competitive effects seldom revisit the merger several years later to see whether they predicted accurately 121 a data retrospective would enable enforcement agencies to evaluate their assumptions and identify new competitive effects 122 a more ambitious goal would be to establish a structural presumption for data intensive mergers 123 one could imagine a presumption triggered by the resulting data advantages of a merging entity that would force the firms to explain why the data asset is not a competitive concern 124 this would be particularly valuable in data intensive industries where defining a market has proven difficult finally enforcement agencies need to be proactive in learning how new technologies are interacting with industries beyond the sectors most closely associated with the digital economy as noted by economists dominique guellec and caroline paunov 125 there should be a research team thinking holistically about how market structures and business models are changing these findings should affect how the federal government enforces competition policy enforcement agencies across the world are now trying to address whether and how data are a competitive advantage 126 the european commission has created an academic advisory council to research the issue 127 as has the united kingdom s competition and markets authority 128 and the united states ftc has held hearings on the topic 129 establish data sharing requirements in october 2017 the cfpb released a set of principles to help foster the development of innovative financial products and services increase competition in financial markets and empower consumers to take greater control of their financial lives 130 the guidelines although nonbinding laid out a clear expectation that banks should share financial information with financial applications when requested by bank customers previously large financial institutions had resisted such efforts worried that powered by these data startups could enter more easily banks business lines as the new york times reported both sides see big money to be made from the reams of highly personal information created by financial transactions 131 similar interventions could be applied beyond finance 132 where appropriate agencies should look to draft sector specific data sharing provisions to mandate that firms open application programming interfaces and enable access to useful data feeds another approach is to facilitate open data standards in sectors where data are competitively significant inconsistent data standards can stymie startups while giving incumbent firms an advantage by making it harder to access information consistent and open data standards reduce the friction of data sharing and lower entry barriers 133 several sectors have already taken this step for example public private partnerships were established in the health care and energy sectors to make it easier for consumers to access and share information with other applications through consistent data frameworks 134 a third approach to enhance competition especially in emerging high growth fields such as ai is to have the government establish data clearinghouses weather data for instance are collected through various agencies with public infrastructure and now support a burgeoning market of private apps and services the obama administration called for releasing a significant number of government data sets for training ai as part of an open data for ai initiative 135 a similar concept could be applied to real time mapping infrastructure for autonomous vehicles not only would this improve safety but it would also create a baseline platform for new entrants to be trained 136 a final approach that is gaining prominence is data portability 137 fueled by enormous amounts of data collected on individual consumers applications can personalize people s experiences this level of personalization increases switching costs for consumers and creates higher entry barriers for startups the premise behind data portability is to enable users to carry data with them from application to application more than just empowering consumers it would also lower barriers to entry in data intensive markets allowing startups to more ably compete with dominant incumbents 138 already some of the largest platforms allow users to port their data 139 it is also required under europe s new data protection law 140 a new proposal by joshua gans goes beyond user generated data and includes interoperability of user content by enabling users to communicate across platforms without necessarily being on a platform it eliminates the need for a coordinated move among users to recreate network effects on a new platform 141 as gans notes incumbents may still come out on top as they may be able to offer a better service but true interoperability of data permissions and content would remove powerful entry barriers tax monopoly rents the aforementioned policies aim to reduce barriers to entry however even if all of these policies were implemented successfully there are large firms currently earning large rents that would likely remain untouched firms with significant economies of scale for example may be able to defend against new firm entry for sustained periods to complement entry related policies the authors propose implementing a higher marginal tax on the profits of firms that have accrued high rents over an extended period such a tax would have three effects while it would not break up a firm it would reduce the flow of economic rents making these revenues available for public purposes with no harm to efficiency 142 it would also discourage further efforts to enhance market power through actions such as mergers and acquisitions moreover it would diminish the ability of these firms to use their outsize returns to influence political and regulatory outcomes the origins of this idea go as far back as to supreme court justice louis brandeis who in the 1930s called for an annual excise tax rapidly progressing in the rate as the total capitalization of the corporation rises as a mechanism to restrain the growth of firms 143 similarly judge richard posner floated an excess profits tax as one of several approaches to rein in natural monopolies such a tax he wrote would require the regulated firm to divide its monopoly profits with the public 144 firms q values along with other data could be used to identify those that are earning measurably sustained rents and set a higher corporate tax rate for these firms 145 for example when a firm s q value is persistently greater than 2 markets are signaling that more than half of the firm s earnings are from rents taxing away such rents would not affect competitive efficiency and the revenue generated could be used to support public sector projects which would in turn reduce income inequality 146 conclusion this report presents the case for an enhanced competition policy on the basis of the empirical evidence reviewed there is good reason to conclude that market competition is not delivering the expected results in the u s economy the competitive response to high profits the entry of new firms that want to earn a share of those higher returns has not materialized as a result firm owners are earning more consumers are paying more workers are earning less and incumbent firms have less incentive to innovate on their own this report also identifies a set of policy measures that could be used to address these problems they include steps to reduce barriers to entry such as restrictions on acquisitions by firms protected by barriers limits on the ability of such firms to enter into adjacent markets requirements to standardize and share important data and a requirement to allow users to communicate across digital platforms it also proposes a monopoly tax which could complement other proposed pro competition policies there are however many open issues for example this report has not touched on competition in finance a sector that has expanded significantly as a share of the economy in recent decades while market concentration at least in the banking industry has increased nor has this report fully explored issues presented by intellectual property protection or the rise of new technologies such as artificial intelligence these and other matters will be the subject of future work about the

philippines based regional lender s latest economic outlook forecasts that growth in developing asia will slow slightly to 5 7 this year and 5 6 in 2020 in 2017 growth was at 6 2 the main risk to the outlook is still the ongoing trade conflict as heightened trade policy uncertainty can negatively affect investment and manufacturing activity it said a sharper slowdown in the advanced economies or the prc people s republic of china is another risk the update comes as china and the u s prepare for another round of talks this week in washington aimed at resolving their dispute over china s industrial policies and acquisition of technology after the dispute escalated in mid 2018 with both sides imposing billions of dollars worth of tariffs on each other s products world trade weakened contracting nearly 2 in january from a year earlier the report shows it said the solid growth momentum in the first nine months of the year began to fade in the last quarter growth in industrial production also showed signs of weakness the adb report said this is an added burden as the business cycle for major economies heads into a negative trend said the adb s chief economist yasuyuki sawada this global business cycle seems to create some impact on asian economies he said in an interview it s not only trade tensions other reports show similar sluggishness in the region which remains the main driver for world economic growth the latest set of purchasing manager indexes showed slight improvements in exports in march from january february for indonesia vietnam thailand and taiwan as well as china but other data suggest that growth in china could well weaken again in the near term capital economics said in a report as such we think it is too soon to predict a turn in

year the bank expects growth in the area using the euro to fall to 1 5 in 2019 and 2020 from 1 8 in 2018 on the positive side inflation should remain manageable and domestic demand in many economies

plunged in recent months in one of the biggest reversals of sentiment developing countries in asia are seeing an uptick in investment from many parts of the world especially china it noted china s foreign direct investment in new projects such as renewable energy textile factories and property in the region nearly tripled while investment by the u s jumped by nearly three quarters while much of the adb s report focused on trade and investment the bank urged governments across the region to devote more resources to cultivating resilience and taking measures to help prevent or mitigate natural disasters the report noted that 84 of the 206 million people affected by natural disasters each year in 2000 2018 lived in developing asian economies more than half of the 60 000 deaths from such catastrophes each year were in this region which suffers a large share of extreme weather events and earthquakes the report says that a large share of the 1 7 trillion in annual investments in infrastructure needed over the coming decade should go to reducing risks from such disasters one area of concern is insurance almost all direct damage is not covered by insurance sawada said another area that could yield strong results is in weather forecasting and warnings in the asia pacific home to four of every five people affected by storms and other disasters while earthquakes and tsunamis are virtually impossible to predict when it comes to extreme weather there is room for constructing mechanisms and building up early warning systems sawada said there is huge potential
1 world trade will continue to face strong headwinds in 2019 and 2020 after a slower than expected growth in 2018 due to rising trade tensions and increased economic uncertainty according to the world trade organisation wto economists expect global merchandise trade volume growth to fall to 2 6 per cent in 2019 from 3 0 per cent in 2018 trade growth could then rebound to 3 0 per cent in 2020 depending however on an easing of trade tensions it said trade growth in 2018 was weighed down by several factors including new tariffs and retaliatory measures affecting widely traded goods weaker global economic growth volatility in financial markets and tighter monetary conditions in developed countries among others consensus estimates have world gdp growth slowing from 2 9 per cent in 2018 to 2 6 per cent in both 2019 and 2020 wto said with trade tensions running high no one should be surprised by this outlook trade cannot play its full role in driving growth when we see such high levels of uncertainty it is increasingly urgent that we resolve tensions and focus on charting a positive path forward for global trade which responds to the real challenges in today s economy such as the technological revolution and the imperative of creating jobs and boosting development wto director general roberto azevedo said if we forget the fundamental importance of the rules based trading system we would risk weakening it which would be an historic mistake with repercussions for jobs growth and stability around the world he added the preliminary estimate of 3 0 per cent for world trade growth in 2018 is below the wto s most recent forecast of 3 9 per cent issued last september the shortfall is mostly explained by a worse than expected result in the fourth quarter when world trade as measured by the average of exports and imports declined by 0 3 per cent until then third quarter trade had been up 3 8 per cent in line with wto projections nominal trade values rose in 2018 due to a combination of volume and price changes world merchandise exports totalled 19 48 trillion up 10 per cent from the previous year the rise was driven partly by higher oil prices which increased by roughly 20 per cent between 2017 and 2018 the value of commercial services trade rose nearly as much with exports totalling 5 80 trillion in 2018 up 8 pe cent from the previous year there were few changes in export and import rankings among major traders in terms of dollar values the fastest merchandise export growth in nominal terms was recorded by oil producers including the kingdom of saudi arabia 34 8 per cent and the russian federation 25 6 per cent merchandise import values increased most for indonesia 20 2 per cent brazil 19 8 per cent china 15 8 per cent and viet nam 15 4 per cent among commercial services traders china recorded strong increases in the value of its exports 17 per cent and imports 12 per cent india also recorded double digit growth in commercial services trade on both the export side 11 per cent and the import side 14 per cent wto said its current trade forecast downgraded gdp projections for north america europe and asia mostly due to macroeconomic considerations including the diminishing effect of expansionary fiscal policy in the united states the phase out of monetary stimulus in the euro area and the ongoing economic rebalancing of the chinese economy away from manufacturing and investment and toward services and consumption wto said the impact of trade tensions on actual trade flows is difficult to quantify since it depended on the nature of any proposed measures and whether they are implemented or only threatened threatened measures can still have real effects by increasing uncertainty and discouraging investment it added in a worst case scenario in which international cooperation on tariffs breaks down completely and all countries set tariffs unilaterally wto economists expect a reduction in world gdp in 2022 of about 2 per cent and a reduction in global trade of about 17 per cent compared to baseline projections other risks to the trade outlook are more difficult to quantify for example the effects of brexit will depend on the nature of any agreement that might be reached between the united kingdom and the european union with impacts mostly confined to these economies lower investment in the u k is likely in most foreseeable brexit scenarios which would tend to reduce productive capacity over time developments in 2018 according to wto the slowdown in merchandise trade volume growth in 2018 was broad based reflecting weaker import demand in both developed and developing countries although some regions were more strongly affected than others weakness was most evident in the fourth quarter of 2018 when export volumes declined by 0 1 per cent and import volumes dropped 0 5 per cent on the export side the slowdown was mostly due to reduced shipments from developed countries which contracted year on year in three out of the four quarters of 2018 on the import side developed countries recorded slow growth throughout the year particularly in the first half developing economies saw imports fall sharply 2 1 per cent in the final quarter despite stronger growth earlier in the year wto pointed out the deceleration of trade in 2018 was driven primarily by europe and asia due to their large share in world imports 37 per cent and 35 per cent respectively after recording strong increases in 2017 asia saw its trade growth moderate in 2018 meanwhile europe s exports stagnated throughout the year while its imports declined gradually and despite heightened trade tensions a buoyant us economy contributed to strong import growth of 5 0 per cent in 2018 other regions encompassing africa the middle east and commonwealth of independent states saw export growth accelerate to 2 7 per cent south america s trade flows have continued to recover gradually but have been buffeted by weaker external demand and domestic economic shocks world commercial services trade recorded strong growth in 2018 for the second consecutive year goods related services registered the strongest expansion with a 10 6 per cent increase in current dollar terms the weakest growth was in transport which rose by 7 1 per cent commercial services overall grew 7 7 per cent in 2018 wto s forward looking trade indicators have turned negative in recent months including the wto s world trade outlook indicator wtoi wto s index of economic policy uncertainty mostly based on the frequency of press reports has risen consistently over time peaking at 341 in december 2018 coinciding with the us government shutdown and us trade negotiations with china to the extent that economic uncertainty deters investment wto said it can have a negative impact on trade since capital goods tend to have high import content conversely a lowering of trade tensions would be expected to stimulate both investment and trade if current gdp forecasts are realised the wto expects the volume of world merchandise trade to grow by 2 6 per cent in 2019 with stronger expansion in developing economies 3 4 per cent for exports 3 6 per cent for imports than in developed ones 2 1 per cent for exports 1 9 per cent for imports world trade growth should pick up slightly in 2020 to 3 0 per cent with growth in developing economies 3 7 percent for exports 3 9 percent for imports again outpacing developed countries 2 5 per cent for exports 1 9 per cent for imports most risks remain firmly on the downside with upside potential hinging on a relaxation of trade tensions wto added
open this photo in gallery governor of the bank of canada stephen poloz speaks during a business luncheon in montreal on feb 21 2019 graham hughes the canadian press the u s bond market is no longer signalling economic trouble ahead bolstering the view held by a number of economists and central bankers that last month s yield curve inversion the first of its kind in more than a decade was likely a brief blip rather than an omen as a signal just the fact that it goes there is not sufficient it has to persist there for some time michael gregory deputy chief economist at bmo nesbitt burns said mr gregory s comments follow a similarly upbeat view on monday from bank of canada governor stephen poloz who said during a news conference that historically low interest rates suggest that yield curve inversions when short term bonds yield more than long term bonds will occur far more frequently than they used to we re always going to be closer to a flat and low yield curve and therefore statistically it s more possible to see inversions that are just innocent ones mr poloz said the stock market appears to agree on wednesday the s p 500 and canada s s p tsx composite index both notched fresh highs for the year a yield curve inversion is an unusual occurrence that has preceded the past seven recessions including the 2008 financial crisis its predictive abilities may explain why the stock market was initially rattled last month on march 22 when the yield on the 10 year u s treasury bond dipped below the yield on the three month u s treasury bill for the first time since 2007 the s p 500 fell 1 9 per cent over concerns that the decade old economic expansion was nearing an end the gloom spread to canada where the yield curve had also inverted but u s and canadian yield curves have reverted to normal as the yields on 10 year government bonds have rebounded over the past five days lifting them above three month yields that s raising the question of whether the bond market is now sending an all clear signal for economic activity and a bullish signal for the stock market some observers remain cautious capital economics expects that previous rate hikes by the federal reserve and fading fiscal stimulus from previous tax cuts will lower growth in u s gross domestic product to 2 per cent this year down from 2 9 per cent in 2018 as well i b e s data from refinitiv suggest that u s first quarter earnings for companies in the s p 500 are expected to decline 2 1 per cent from the first quarter of 2018 ed devlin head of canadian portfolio management at pimco one of the world s largest fixed income investment managers said that the reversion to a normal yield curve is reflecting some upbeat global economic developments we had a good gdp print in canada after a slew of bad data you see bond yields in the u k rising pretty dramatically today as it looks like the odds of a disorderly no deal brexit all these kinds of things help with global optimism mr devlin said he added that pimco s baseline assumption is that there will be no recession in either canada or the united states this year mr gregory noted that one of the problems with the yield curve inversion was that it lasted only days and was therefore too brief to be a clear signal of economic trouble ahead as well the signal was not met with corroborating evidence by other parts of the yield curve that is 10 year bond yields remained higher than two year bond yields he believes that part of the rising concerns over the u s economic outlook followed the decline of the stock market late last year when the s p 500 fell 19 8 per cent between september and december which weighed on business confidence and consumer spending now though lower borrowing costs may be spurring economic activity particularly in the housing market and the federal reserve may be willing to tolerate rising inflation without resorting to rate hikes to keep those inflationary pressures in check as we are beginning to see more recent data coming out things look like they are snapping back mr gregory said
